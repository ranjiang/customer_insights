Power bank recommendations?,"Hey, i wanted to buy a power bank to use on my phone and a tablet. Better if its 20000mAh and i dont really mind the fast charging capabilities.

But the most important thing for me is the battery life, i want to know which one has the best battery life (as in how many charge cycles it can endure). I wont really use it a lot, probably twice a week at most.

Since its black Friday it would also be pretty cool if you could mention some with good discounts, thanks!

P.S: I am very aware there are plenty posts like this one, but ive struggled to find any that mention battery life and charge cycle. Feel free to educate me too on this subject if you want to, some tips for better battery life always help.

Edit: Ive found on amazon ""Baseus Power Bank, 65W Power Bank 20000mAh"" which has a 50% discount and seems pretty good based on reviews. Problem is that i dont trust amazon and its sales since they usually recommend trendy and ""cheaply made"" products by obscure brands.

State of power banks in 2025,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been really grateful for all the gear recommendations I’ve picked up here over the years, this community is full of gems. I’m curious what people are using these days for keeping devices powered while hiking. 

Are traditional power banks still the go-to, or have people moved on to other setups (like vape batteries or newer tech)?

I’ve been using the Anker MagGo with a built-in Apple Watch charger and USB-C cable, which has been great, but it’s only 10,000 mAh. I’m looking for something a little bigger (up to 20,000 mAh), ideally still lightweight and capable of 30W fast charging. It’ll be powering an iPhone 16 Pro Max, Petzl Bindi headtorch, and AirPods Pro on trail.

Would love to hear what’s working for you, any recommendations or new discoveries would be massively appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Battery Banks,"Okay, so, I have tried to make heads or tails of the world of battery banks, and quite frankly I'm more puzzled than when I began. Right now I have an s23 ultra, 5,000 mAh in it. And I am trying to find a battery bank that will charge it at least one full time, if not twice preferably. I currently am using the gen 2 nitecore 10,000 and I've noticed it does not charge twice as the numbers would suggest. Which lead me to the rated power. At that point I was totally lost. If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated! Just trying to find something reliable and reasonably lightweight that can charge at least like 2 full or almost full charges. I can't seem to make sense of the lights on the nightcore either, because it went from 3 to 1 light, charging my phone from 20 to 85%, then i charged my phone again layer, 25 to 60%, and it's still on one light?

I dear the right wingers to justify this," Tariffs negatively impact the U.S. economy by driving up prices for imported goods, which raises costs for businesses and consumers, leading to reduced spending and slowed economic growth. For companies that rely heavily on global supply chains, such as tech and automotive industries, the increased costs from tariffs squeeze profit margins, discouraging investments and hiring. This uncertainty unsettles investors, often resulting in significant stock market declines, as seen in steep drops in major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Retaliatory tariffs from trade partners limit access to international markets, hurting U.S. exports and compounding economic strain. The combined effect of higherproduction costs, reduced consumer demand, and fear of a trade war leads to a widespread loss of investor confidence, causing financial markets to lose value and intensifying economic instability.

Just to add some Crypto bros are fuming rn
2.  The only people that are benefiting from Tariffs rn are billionaires 
3. The chinese car manufacturers are beating General motors...like guys come on, you wouldn't want to buy a car that could drive through rivers and jump over potholes?

Trump makes history by pardoning a corporation,"In what may be a first in American history, President Trump just expanded the presidential pardon power to include corporations.

Corporations are artificial legal fictions designed to maximize shareholder wealth. Nonetheless, they can theoretically commit crimes and be indicted for them. According to a 1999 memorandum from the Justice Department, the “important public benefits” of prosecuting corporations include “deterrence on a massive scale,” particularly for “crimes that carry with them a substantial risk of public harm,” such as “financial frauds.”

Such public benefits now fall prey to the whims of the president with his pardon of a cryptocurrency company that smacks of political corruption.

On Friday, Trump issued full and unconditional pardons to four individuals and a related cryptocurrency exchange, BitMEX.

BitMEX solicits and takes orders for trades in derivatives tied to the value of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Last summer, BitMEX entered a guilty plea in a Manhattan federal court for violating the Bank Secrecy Act for having operated without a legitimate anti-money laundering program. Prior to August 2020, customers could register to trade with BitMEX anonymously, providing only verified email addresses.

On Jan. 15, 2025, BitMEX was criminally fined $100 million in connection with its guilty plea, which was on top of $130 million in civil penalties previously imposed by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. At sentencing, the judge noted that BitMEX, which is incorporated in the Seychelles, had claimed not to operate in the U.S. for several years even though U.S. customers comprised a large share of its business.",16546,https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/5224229-trump-makes-history-by-pardoning-a-corporation/,1743552466.0,law,"Trump makes history by pardoning a corporation In what may be a first in American history, President Trump just expanded the presidential pardon power to include corporations.

Home buying resentment amongst friendship groups in London,"There is a fascinating phenomena happening in London friendship groups that I’m beginning to realise. You ever notice how nothing exposes the working/middle class divide quite like a mate buying a house in London? One day you’re all in the same boat, rationing food in the last week of the month, sharing Netflix accounts, living off Tesco meal deals and complaining about landlords hiking the rent again. And then out of nowhere, someone’s announcing they’ve put down a deposit on a two-bed in Clapham—courtesy of the Bank of Mum and Dad. And suddenly, there’s this unspoken shift. No one says it outright, but there’s a weird tension, a quiet resentment that creeps in, not necessarily because you begrudge their new home, but because it highlights something deeper: the invisible hand of privilege.

You ever notice how nothing exposes the working/middle class divide quite like a mate buying a house in London? One day you’re all in the same boat, rationing food in the last week of the month, sharing Netflix accounts, living off Tesco meal deals and complaining about landlords hiking the rent again. And then out of nowhere, someone’s announcing they’ve put down a deposit on a two-bed in Clapham—courtesy of the Bank of Mum and Dad. And suddenly, there’s this unspoken shift. No one says it outright, but there’s a weird tension, a quiet resentment that creeps in, not necessarily because you begrudge their new home, but because it highlights something deeper: the invisible hand of privilege.

UPDATE: AITAH for cutting off my parents to leaving everything to my brother," 

https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/lxI3U5S6GU

Hey. So the consensus on my post was a bit of a mixed bag. I sat down with my parents and I wanted to give an update and answer some stuff. 

My brother is not actually disabled. He just has a low IQ, just over 80. You need an IQ under 70 where I live to be considered disabled and to qualify for any sort of benefits. My parents have babied him because from a young age he wasn’t as smart as other kids, and had a low self esteem because of that, and was quick to give up on things when they seemed too hard. He does ok on his own now. He works and pays his bills most of the time. He drives and lives with a roommate. 

On to the update, I sat down with my parents and explained that I’ve always felt like they treated me worse than my brother. They always emphasized to me that as an adult you need to support yourself, and figure things out on your own. I had to join the military at 17 because I knew they’d kick me out when I was 18. My parents never offered me any support outside of raising me as a child. They didn’t buy my husband and I a wedding gift, they didn’t offer much of anything. Meanwhile they brag about having over a million dollars in the bank, and having succeeded from nothing. 

Meanwhile they paid to put my brother through two trade schools that he failed out of, offered him money to start his own business. They’ve always bailed him out when he was short on rent. 

For me it’s not so much about the money, but about the disparity in how we’ve been treated. It’s obvious that they loved and cared him him more, because they were willing to do these things for him, and not me. 

But despite them not being there for me, I’ve still done really well in life. I told my parents about all of this, and they were interrupting me and talking over me the whole time. They told me I’m not entitled a to dime when they die, and that I’m an adult and I can handle myself. They just weren’t understanding or even caring about my point. They told me I need to step up and treat them better, and that it’s wrong of me to not take my sick mother to the doctor or take care of her because of money. 

Eventually I just gave up on trying to talk about my feelings. They just don’t care. I told them that they’re adults, and they’re not entitled to anything from me. Just like how they were never required to help me, I’m not required to help me. I told them to complete remove me from their will, I’m not willing to be their estate executor, medical power of attorney, nothing. I don’t want a dime from them at this point, and I suggested they spend all the money they’ve saved over the years to pay for really good nursing homes, and an estate executor, because I’m no longer willing to do anything for them. 

My mother was floored, and asked if I’d really put my own parents in a nursing home. I asked if they’d really let their 17 year old daughter join the army to get sexually harassed by older men in order to go to school without taking on a huge debt. 

My parents cried and yelled at me. And I left. And that’s that I guess. I kind of feel relieved, like a massive weight is off my shoulders. I have a wonderful husband, we own a nice home. I’m getting ready to start working on my masters degree, and we’re thinking about maybe having a baby soon. I no longer have to worry about dealing with my parents. They’re adults and they can deal with their own problems, just like I’ve done with mine. And yeah, that’s it. Not sure if it’s the update we wanted, but it is what it is. 

Tdlr: My parents wanted to leave almost everything to my older brother because he’s not as successful in life. I feel like my parents have always favored him over me. My parents don’t care about my feelings and won’t listen to them, so I told them our relationship is over. I don’t want anything from them at this point, and I’m moving on.

AITA for Refusing to Drop My Ex-Husband’s Last Name?,"I (56F) divorced my husband two years ago after 26 years of marriage. We have four kids, and the split was amicable. He came out as gay, and we mutually agreed to part ways. Changing my name wasn’t a priority—updating IDs, legal documents, and bank accounts would be a huge hassle. I still use his last name on official documents but go by my maiden name socially.

Recently, he got engaged to a wonderful guy. I’ve been supportive of their relationship, but during my grandson’s birthday party, my ex suddenly asked if I’d consider dropping his last name. His fiancé chimed in, saying it makes him uncomfortable that I still use it. I was caught off guard and awkwardly joked that unless they want to spend hours in lines at various government offices, I wasn’t going to change it. My ex didn’t laugh. He insisted it’s about starting a new chapter and wants me to “move on.”

The whole situation felt bizarre. For two years, it’s never been an issue, and now they’re ganging up on me? After the party, my ex called and argued that keeping his name makes it hard for his fiancé to feel like they’re starting a fresh life. I countered that our kids still use the same name, and it would feel strange for me to be the odd one out.

What really hurt was learning from my youngest son that his fiancé feels threatened by my name, assuming I’m clinging to some claim on my ex.

Hi there, long-time reader but a first time poster. The long and short is that my for about six years now my husband has been a Freemason and I've always supported him on this. My grandfather was a Freemason so it's not really 'new' to me or anything and I don't believe in any of the conspiracy crap you find online. But I'm starting to think it may not be the best for him. My grandpa always used to say it went Family, Work, Masonry but in my husband's case its more Masonry, Masonry, Masonry, then Family, then Work, then Masonry again. He attends Lodge nearly *every* night (For context my grandpa would go a couple times a month) and yet he's only a Fellow Craft so not a part of the add-on things like the Scottish Rite or Shriners or anything. I genuinely don't know how he has the stamina for it because I'm a part of an improv theatre club and frankly every other week is enough. Some times he's gone for hours, other times an hour or even less. When I ask him what he's doing he gets defensive and says he can't tell me because he has to maintain secrecy. I knew full well there'd be some 'lessons' and ceremonies I wouldn't exactly be getting a front row seat for but I don't think it's that unfair I ask what he could be possibly doing that occupies him practically daily. Hell some days when he comes back early, he goes to his man cave do to *more* work for them. Apparently he's volunteered to do admin work for his Grand Lodge but like...when does it end? He doesn't get paid for any of this and he *spends* so much on dues to actually do this! 

I've even tried to get involved via the OES (something I've always wanted to be a part of) but he point blank shut it down and said that we can only look into that when he becomes a Master Mason which is apparently still ""years away"". And it's not even just our marriage it's affecting, some weeks he's out so late with his Lodge buddies, he doesn't take care of himself. There's been times he hasn't worn clean clothes or shaved and plenty of times he's gone into work without showering. Sometimes he doesn't even go into work and just calls in hours late to say he's been called for urgent lodge business. His boss is too good to him and let's it slide because he's genuinely blown away my husband's in the Masons and thinks these meetings must be dead important. Like I get a lot of these guys are going to be retired but Jesus Christ surely they have to know how it works? It's making a bad impression with people and I genuinely can't remember the last time we did a thing together as a couple. Plus our bedroom has been dead for at least a year which I've sort of put up with because I have a low libido but I guess it's just another symptom. Every time I ask him to do *anything* he just tells me he's too tired. 

I guess how do I get it across to him his Masonic life needs to slow down. It's not even affecting just me, it's affecting our whole lives but I don't even know where to begin. I don't want him to leave the Masons just...maybe calm it down a little so we have our lives back. How can I get this across to him without seeming that I'm jealous of the secrets or I want to worsen the wedge between us. Btw I did actually email the WM his Lodge to just say I'm kind of worried for him but I've not heard back yet and if they're all this active not sure how much help he'll be. Thanks for any advice! 

Edit: WM just emailed me. Apologized for taking his time and explained my husband has not been a member of that lodge for at least five years, having left just under a year after he joined. Apparently he had ""difficulties with the leadership"" and had been repeatedly cautioned for ""soliciting"" the other lodge members. He told me checked with other lodges in the area and none of them have any record of him switching so it seems he demitted entirely...

He's going to come round tomorrow and we're going to...discuss it with my husband then. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/KaS4bxiyUQ)  **Dec 4, 2024** 

Hi everyone - you might remember [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h3i8cz/comment/m0bi1f2/?context=3) where I mentioned how Freemasonry, or rather my husband's commitment to it, was destroying our marriage and corroding his life. Well I apologize to the Craft because Masonry had nothing to do with my husband's antics. In my update to the post, I mentioned I had spoken with the current Worshipful Master (basically the lodge's chair) and he informed me my husband had demitted from that lodge years ago and never joined any others. He did suggest it could be a clandestine lodge (and in a way I hoped this would be the case) but I think we both knew that was highly unlikely. He also ended up putting me through to a Past Master who was Senior Warden of the Lodge around the time my husband quit and apparently it was a jumped before he was pushed situation. I did mention my husband was in trouble for 'soliciting' his brothers but the WM couldn't tell me anymore. The PM vaguely remembered it and while it seems no one was exactly sure what he was soliciting them about, it was described as invasive and strange behavior. Me and the PM, David, (might as well use names) had a good long chat before he offered to join me in discussing this with my husband, Kevin, with the hope being we could get through to him and steer him off whatever course he was on. Sadly, I don't have good news. 

David came round on Monday and we talked a lot beforehand. Kevin was out of course. Most of our chat was just him being generally supportive but he did start asking questions that were definitely leading into the clandestine lodge route though he dropped that as a theory when it the lack of self-care became evident. Mid-way through our conversation, Kevin comes home and when he comes in I say there's somebody I'd like him to meet and he just deflects by saying he's tired from lodge and we'll have to do it tomorrow. David introduces himself anyway, explicitly as a PM. Kevin ignores him but then goes through to the kitchen, pours himself a glass of milk and starts scrolling through his phone at the kitchen table. We went through and sat down at the table too so without a word he got up and went into the living room so we followed him there where David said we know he's not attending lodge because he was the Senior Warden when my husband left. Kevin does this weird laugh and says so it's a crime to move lodges then? David says no other lodge in the area took him on and Kevin goes a little bit red before saying that's because he switched to PHA and then sort of insinuates David is racist for ""taking issue"" with that. David says he spoke to all the PHA lodges in the area too and he's good friends with a lot of their members so he knows he's lying again. Kevin just says look he's tired, he's not doing this but I told him we know something's up and well, the majority of you thought it was drugs, so I just said look is it drugs? He said no, but finally admitted yes there was ""something"" up and asked if he could show us something. Just he needed to go to his car. David said that's fine, we'll come with him. 

Well I guess in Kevin's defense he did need to go to his car. In the trunk he got out this black sports bag and I dunno what I was expecting but I don't think anything could have prepared me for what he showed us was inside. When we got back into the house, he got out this near lifelike, latex horse mask and other leather and latex fetish gear, full suit with harnesses and everything. If you were expecting anything to happen, there wasn't anything, we kind of just stared in total silence. Eventually Kevin restarted the conversation by explaining he was into a BDSM fetish called ""pony play"" and that he went down the rabbit hole a long time ago. I won't really go into the full details but long and short is he's clearly been dealing with homosexual feelings and submissive desires for a long time though he's still in denial about both of them and is adamant he's not bi or gay, 100% straight etc. Obviously he's at least (and most probably) bi but he wouldn't hear it. Anyway, he explained when he was really struggling with these feelings (""the urge"" as he calls it), that's when he joined Freemasonry because he hoped it would prove a distraction, help improve etc. and then sort of implied being around old men would put him off guys. I could tell David was a bit offended but he didn't say anything. But yeah apparently this is what the soliciting was about. Obviously joining the Masons didn't make these feelings go away so he said he initially started trying to see if any of them felt those feelings too but no one would bite. Apparently mid-way through he discovered the pony play rabbit hole on a BDSM website and was utterly hooked. This is when his soliciting went from ""Hey I'm having these feelings towards guys, this is totally normal right brother?"" to ""Hey are you looking to buy a 'pony' brother?"" He claimed he didn't leave because he was being disciplined but because of how ""goddamn prudish"" everyone was. Yeah. Apparently he was already deep into the hole and while he'd be attending lodge a couple times a month legitimately, the other times were him doing the BDSM stuff. 

Apparently it began with escorts but eventually he 'graduated' to pro-dommes because too many of them found it weird or 'weren't into it enough'. There's one main one he goes to the most, called Mistress Candy but when she's busy he'll go to other ones. And if that's not an option, he'll go find a cheap hotel to ""self-care"" or do it with an online mistress. Oh there's a lot of them apparently and that was how he got into 'findoms' where the whole thing is he gives them money for nothing in return. I don't really know how to describe how I felt as this all came out. The shock, the betrayal, the rage, the upset, the hurt. I suppose I feel quite numb now but none of it could have prepared me for what he did next. David said so you've been having an affair then and using the Craft as cover. Kevin got very angry and said he's not been having an affair. This sparked an argument (again won't go into the details) where Kevin's 'excuse' was that at no point was he in control during this, because Mistress Candy made use of hypnosis to control him and sometimes the urge was so powerful it would ""m-shift"" him into 'Sparkles', his pony persona, involuntarily. He didn't use this as an example but I guess it's kind of like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde situation. Again, no remorse or contrition and he said we can still fix this with couples therapy because apparently I wasn't ""satisfying his needs"". How did he come to that conclusion? Well I never independently suggested pony play and give him an 'avenue' to open up about it, this is somehow my fault. I won't go into the arguments that followed but it ended with me packing a bag and David taking me to my parents place. I've told Kevin I'll be seeking a divorce - something which he's also in denial about - because the marriage is dead. Clearly he values his time playing dress up as a horse more than he does me as a person so I might as well let him focus on that. 

I'm staying with my parents right now and taking some time off work until I can clear my head. Can't sleep so figured I might as well try and get this out of my system. It has helped honestly. I'm also currently no-contact with Kevin and it'll be staying that way until I can serve him papers. Who knows what the future holds there but he won't be in it. Though if you wanted some good news, I'm finally joining the OES! David explained to me I can join via my grandfather so I'm going to be meeting with the Secretary next week. Thanks for being on this wild ride and helping me see reason. I guess I would probably have got here anyway when the WM messaged me but it was nice to know I had people on here and especially those who talked it through with me in DMs. You guys know who you are and you were awesome! Otherwise have a great day and peace out.

Hi there, long-time reader but a first time poster. The long and short is that my for about six years now my husband has been a Freemason and I've always supported him on this. My grandfather was a Freemason so it's not really 'new' to me or anything and I don't believe in any of the conspiracy crap you find online. But I'm starting to think it may not be the best for him. My grandpa always used to say it went Family, Work, Masonry but in my husband's case its more Masonry, Masonry, Masonry, then Family, then Work, then Masonry again. He attends Lodge nearly *every* night (For context my grandpa would go a couple times a month) and yet he's only a Fellow Craft so not a part of the add-on things like the Scottish Rite or Shriners or anything. I genuinely don't know how he has the stamina for it because I'm a part of an improv theatre club and frankly every other week is enough. Some times he's gone for hours, other times an hour or even less. When I ask him what he's doing he gets defensive and says he can't tell me because he has to maintain secrecy. I knew full well there'd be some 'lessons' and ceremonies I wouldn't exactly be getting a front row seat for but I don't think it's that unfair I ask what he could be possibly doing that occupies him practically daily. Hell some days when he comes back early, he goes to his man cave do to *more* work for them. Apparently he's volunteered to do admin work for his Grand Lodge but like...when does it end? He doesn't get paid for any of this and he *spends* so much on dues to actually do this! 

I've even tried to get involved via the OES (something I've always wanted to be a part of) but he point blank shut it down and said that we can only look into that when he becomes a Master Mason which is apparently still ""years away"". And it's not even just our marriage it's affecting, some weeks he's out so late with his Lodge buddies, he doesn't take care of himself. There's been times he hasn't worn clean clothes or shaved and plenty of times he's gone into work without showering. Sometimes he doesn't even go into work and just calls in hours late to say he's been called for urgent lodge business. His boss is too good to him and let's it slide because he's genuinely blown away my husband's in the Masons and thinks these meetings must be dead important. Like I get a lot of these guys are going to be retired but Jesus Christ surely they have to know how it works? It's making a bad impression with people and I genuinely can't remember the last time we did a thing together as a couple. Plus our bedroom has been dead for at least a year which I've sort of put up with because I have a low libido but I guess it's just another symptom. Every time I ask him to do *anything* he just tells me he's too tired. 

I guess how do I get it across to him his Masonic life needs to slow down. It's not even affecting just me, it's affecting our whole lives but I don't even know where to begin. I don't want him to leave the Masons just...maybe calm it down a little so we have our lives back. How can I get this across to him without seeming that I'm jealous of the secrets or I want to worsen the wedge between us. Btw I did actually email the WM his Lodge to just say I'm kind of worried for him but I've not heard back yet and if they're all this active not sure how much help he'll be. Thanks for any advice! 

Edit: WM just emailed me. Apologized for taking his time and explained my husband has not been a member of that lodge for at least five years, having left just under a year after he joined. Apparently he had ""difficulties with the leadership"" and had been repeatedly cautioned for ""soliciting"" the other lodge members. He told me checked with other lodges in the area and none of them have any record of him switching so it seems he demitted entirely...

>>So far not much though I've spoken with a PM who was the Senior Warden around the time my husband left. He says he can't remember precisely what the soliciting involved (and it was never too explicitly) but it definitely came across as ""creepy"" and ""invasive"", along with lots of weird questions about masculinity. He's going to come round tomorrow and we're going to...discuss it with my husband then. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/KaS4bxiyUQ)  **Dec 4, 2024** 

Hi everyone - you might remember [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h3i8cz/comment/m0bi1f2/?context=3) where I mentioned how Freemasonry, or rather my husband's commitment to it, was destroying our marriage and corroding his life. Well I apologize to the Craft because Masonry had nothing to do with my husband's antics. In my update to the post, I mentioned I had spoken with the current Worshipful Master (basically the lodge's chair) and he informed me my husband had demitted from that lodge years ago and never joined any others. He did suggest it could be a clandestine lodge (and in a way I hoped this would be the case) but I think we both knew that was highly unlikely. He also ended up putting me through to a Past Master who was Senior Warden of the Lodge around the time my husband quit and apparently it was a jumped before he was pushed situation. I did mention my husband was in trouble for 'soliciting' his brothers but the WM couldn't tell me anymore. The PM vaguely remembered it and while it seems no one was exactly sure what he was soliciting them about, it was described as invasive and strange behavior. Me and the PM, David, (might as well use names) had a good long chat before he offered to join me in discussing this with my husband, Kevin, with the hope being we could get through to him and steer him off whatever course he was on. Sadly, I don't have good news. 

David came round on Monday and we talked a lot beforehand. Kevin was out of course. Most of our chat was just him being generally supportive but he did start asking questions that were definitely leading into the clandestine lodge route though he dropped that as a theory when it the lack of self-care became evident. Mid-way through our conversation, Kevin comes home and when he comes in I say there's somebody I'd like him to meet and he just deflects by saying he's tired from lodge and we'll have to do it tomorrow. David introduces himself anyway, explicitly as a PM. Kevin ignores him but then goes through to the kitchen, pours himself a glass of milk and starts scrolling through his phone at the kitchen table. We went through and sat down at the table too so without a word he got up and went into the living room so we followed him there where David said we know he's not attending lodge because he was the Senior Warden when my husband left. Kevin does this weird laugh and says so it's a crime to move lodges then? David says no other lodge in the area took him on and Kevin goes a little bit red before saying that's because he switched to PHA and then sort of insinuates David is racist for ""taking issue"" with that. David says he spoke to all the PHA lodges in the area too and he's good friends with a lot of their members so he knows he's lying again. Kevin just says look he's tired, he's not doing this but I told him we know something's up and well, the majority of you thought it was drugs, so I just said look is it drugs? He said no, but finally admitted yes there was ""something"" up and asked if he could show us something. Just he needed to go to his car. David said that's fine, we'll come with him. 

Well I guess in Kevin's defense he did need to go to his car. In the trunk he got out this black sports bag and I dunno what I was expecting but I don't think anything could have prepared me for what he showed us was inside. When we got back into the house, he got out this near lifelike, latex horse mask and other leather and latex fetish gear, full suit with harnesses and everything. If you were expecting anything to happen, there wasn't anything, we kind of just stared in total silence. Eventually Kevin restarted the conversation by explaining he was into a BDSM fetish called ""pony play"" and that he went down the rabbit hole a long time ago. I won't really go into the full details but long and short is he's clearly been dealing with homosexual feelings and submissive desires for a long time though he's still in denial about both of them and is adamant he's not bi or gay, 100% straight etc. Obviously he's at least (and most probably) bi but he wouldn't hear it. Anyway, he explained when he was really struggling with these feelings (""the urge"" as he calls it), that's when he joined Freemasonry because he hoped it would prove a distraction, help improve etc. and then sort of implied being around old men would put him off guys. I could tell David was a bit offended but he didn't say anything. But yeah apparently this is what the soliciting was about. Obviously joining the Masons didn't make these feelings go away so he said he initially started trying to see if any of them felt those feelings too but no one would bite. Apparently mid-way through he discovered the pony play rabbit hole on a BDSM website and was utterly hooked. This is when his soliciting went from ""Hey I'm having these feelings towards guys, this is totally normal right brother?"" to ""Hey are you looking to buy a 'pony' brother?""

Apparently it began with escorts but eventually he 'graduated' to pro-dommes because too many of them found it weird or 'weren't into it enough'. There's one main one he goes to the most, called Mistress Candy but when she's busy he'll go to other ones. And if that's not an option, he'll go find a cheap hotel to ""self-care"" or do it with an online mistress.

King Richard led me to believe that Venus and Serena Williams' father was a poor security guard when in fact he was a multi-millionaire. I hate biopics.,"Repost with proof

https://imgur.com/a/9cSiGz4

Before Venus and Serena were born, he had a successful cleaning company, concrete company, and a security guard company.  He owned three houses.  He had 810,000 in the bank just for their tennis.  Adjusted for inflation, he was a multi-millionaire.  

King Richard led me to believe he was a poor security guard barely making ends meet but through his own power and the girl's unique talent, they caught the attention of sponsors that paid for the rest of their training.  Fact was they lived in a house in Long Beach minutes away from the beach.  He moved them to Compton because he had read about Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali coming from the ghetto so they would become battle-hardened and not feel pressure from their matches.  For a father to willingly move his young family to the ghetto is already a fascinating story.  But instead we got lies through omission.  

How many families fell for this false narrative (that's also been put forth by the media?  As a tennis fan for decades I also fell for it) and fell into financial ruin because they dedicated their limited resources and eventually couldn't pay enough for their kids' tennis lessons to get them to having even enough skills to make it to a D3 college?  Kids who lost countless afternoons of their childhoods because of this false narrative?  Or who got a sponsorship with unfair terms and crumbled under the pressure of having to support their families?  Or who got on the lower level tours and didn't have the money to stay on long enough even though they were winning because the prize money is peanuts?  Parents whose marriages disintegrated under such stress?  And who then blamed themselves?  Because just hard work wasn't enough.  Not nearly. They needed money.

Is America great yet?,"I look around Montana, where my property taxes are suddenly 35% higher, and our loudest political voices are millionaires from out of state. It’s hard not to feel like we’ve lost sight of the greatness we were promised.

When will we feel that greatness? Will it come when our national parks become zoos full of miserable mistreated animals, and there is nothing wild and beautiful left? When our children lose hope for a brighter future, stuck in jobs that barely get them by while the wealthy grow wealthier? When we’re so divided that we would watch democracy collapse around us, before we stood up next to someone on the other side.

Politicians from both sides have turned leadership into a spectacle, while we face real struggles. These elected officials, on both local and federal levels, are meant to represent us, but they all seem more focused on their own power than on our well-being. 

Meanwhile, we’re told to point fingers at each other, at our neighbors who vote differently, or at people we’ve never even met. But that division only serves the people in power. While we fight amongst ourselves, they laugh all the way to the bank.

There has to be something we can do, to protect Montana?
How can we hold our leaders accountable? How can we protect our public lands, protect Montana's veterans from these massive cuts? What organizations in Montana are making a difference, and how can we get involved?

Turkey's economic collapse imminent,"**TLDR: Aug 15'25 $TUR $30 Put Market to Open tomorrow morning if trading allowed and here's why:**

* Political unrest amid jailing political opponents
* Just today opposing party leaders announced widespread boycotts - 50m+ people total cohort size
* Turkey's current financial system is flawed, they rely on high interest government bond sales to finance USD-TRY imbalance 

1. **Analysis of Current Reserves:**

* As of March 2025, Turkey’s total (gross) foreign exchange reserves are approximately **$85 billion**.
* However, most of these reserves consist of swap agreements and external debts; the actual (net) reserves are likely close to zero or even negative.
* The truly available (liquid) reserves for rapid intervention are, at best, around **$20–40 billion**.

2. **Activities That Could Rapidly Erode Reserves and Their Effects (Data Supported):**

The following scenarios could rapidly deplete the reserves in the short term:

**Mass Bond Sales and Foreign Exchange Purchases**

* If 30 million people convert an average of **$500** per person from TRY to USD, it would result in a reserve loss of **$15 billion** in a short time.
* *(30 million people × $500 = $15 billion)*

• **Mass Withdrawal of Deposits from Banks (Bank Panic)**

* The total deposits in the Turkish banking system amount to approximately **$450 billion**.
* Even if only **5%** of these deposits are withdrawn in a panic (about **$22.5 billion**), it could deplete more than half of the reserves in one go.

**Tax Payment Refusals and Consumer Boycotts**

* Turkey’s annual tax revenue is approximately **$150 billion** (2024 budget).
* Even a short-term **20%** tax boycott (a loss of about **$2.5 billion per month**) would create a serious budget deficit within a few months.

**Boycotts of Critical Sectors such as Energy and Transportation**

* Turkey’s monthly energy imports average about **$5 billion**.
* Even an extra crisis cost of **20%** in this area could result in an additional monthly reserve loss of **$1 billion**.

**Widespread Labor Strikes**

* A general strike lasting just one week in Turkey would cost approximately **$4–5 billion**.
* Strikes lasting several weeks could rapidly deplete the reserves.

👉 **Total estimated short-term reserve loss (within one month):**

It could be around **$20–40 billion**, which is nearly equivalent to all of Turkey’s actual liquid reserves.

3. **Timeline Scenarios for Collapse (Supported by Figures):**

🔴 **Aggressive Scenario (Full Bank Attack and Demand for Foreign Exchange):**

* If **10%** of bank deposits are withdrawn, it would create a cash need of about **$45 billion**.
* The current liquid reserves (assumed to be around **$30 billion**) would not be able to meet this demand.
* The economy and banking sector could collapse within **7–14 days**.

🟠 **Moderate Scenario (Partial Capital Outflow and Consumer Boycotts):**

* Demand for foreign exchange, tax losses, and reduced consumption would push the monthly reserve loss to around **$5–10 billion**.
* The existing reserves could be depleted in about **2–3 months**, bringing the economic crisis to a critical point.

🟡 **Controlled Scenario (Strict Capital Controls and External Financial Support):**

* Capital outflows could be limited to **$1–2 billion per month**.
* With IMF or external support (for example, **$10–15 billion**), the endurance of reserves could be extended to **6–12 months**.

I think this will lead to a government shutdown or change of power in the end. I don't see a humane way current government regaining back control without going bankrupt. If they do, it will be through terrorizing their own people and hijacking their bank accounts and other assets. If you make money out of this, I will suggest you sell when you see decent profits and buy yourself something nice. Be quick to exit this one.

EDIT: Turkey just BANNED short selling on the Istanbul Stock Exchange for one month.

When short selling is banned, you know that BIG TROUBLES are always right around the corner.

Stay tuned.

UPDATE: Turkey used a stunning $27BN in reserves to stabilize FX. Given recent reserve losses (USD 27bn), there is already large-scale short-term damage.

"APRIL 5TH — Every American Must Hit the Streets. This Is Class War, and They Just Fired Another Shot.","Let me start out by saying that every American should be pissed off. Extremely fucking pissed off. Donald Trump just slapped a 10% tax on every imported good in this country. That means higher prices on food, clothes, medicine, electronics — everything working people rely on — all while billionaires skate by untouched. He’s calling it “tariffs.” Let’s call it what it really is: a working-class tax. And on top of that? 40%+ tariffs on goods from countries like Vietnam and China — the ones providing the cheapest necessities people count on to survive.

This is not economic nationalism. This is economic cruelty. Extreme economic cruelty on the very working class he promised to protect. He lied. Again. The only thing he is manufacturing in America is economic hardship on all of us. While corporations rake in record profits, we are getting handed the bill. The CEOs that make 1000x the average person in this country will simply raise prices when their costs go up to keep their profits intact. They don’t give a crap about anything besides their bank accounts and shareholders. No billionaire in this country truly cares about someone making $60k/year. They support Trump because he consolidates power for the ultra wealthy ruling class of this country. These terrible, narcissistic humans will layoff thousands of their employees before ever considering taking a pay cut.

THIS SATURDAY, APRIL 5TH, every American citizen who’s sick and tired of being exploited needs to be in the streets. Every single one of us. Not just angry — organized. Not just online — outside. Every single one of us. If you are as pissed off as I am, show up. Bring a friend. Bring 5 friends, 10 friends, 100 friends. Get people out into the streets. What’s happening right now is cruel and evil.

CMV: We're Witnessing A Paradigm Shift And The World Will Be More Dangerous For It,"I'm convinced that we're in the midst of a paradigm shift that will upend the world as we know it. After World War II, the US built the international order that we know today, creating NATO and the UN, the IMF/World Bank, the International Trade Organization, making the USD the global reserve currency, and building trade and defense pacts with most of the world. The system was far from perfect, but the past 80 years have been something of a golden age, seeing the human population explode, billions of people brought out of poverty, widespread democraticization and freedoms, strong global development and economic growth, and arguably the most peaceful period of human history. 

This world is unraveling before our very eyes. Trump's tariff, insults, and threats have destroyed America's international alliances and trade partnerships, which will never fully recover. The US is no longer seen as a reliable trade or defense partner by the entire world, for good reason, and the implications of that are profound. 

The US will never be as wealthy, powerful, or respected as it was 3 months ago. Trump is abandoning all of the things that made us a global superpower and the end result will be a world with more conflict, more regional alliances, and more instability as powerful countries scramble to fill the power vacuum left by the US and try to take whatever resources and territory they can, and settle old grievances while they have the opportunity. 

This is a disaster of proportions we've never seen in our lifetimes, and the implications are horrific. It'll mean nuclear proliferation, more war, more genocide, and more refugee crises, which will in turn drive more conflict. Climate change will only exacerbate these issues further, causing mass migrations and even more conflict. 

Everything we've taken for granted for decades is now up in the air and there's a real risk of systemic failure. Don't expect things to just work out, that's just normalcy bias trying to convince you not to panic. People need to stand up and push back against what Trump is doing before even more damage is done and it becomes impossible to prevent the worst case scenarios.

It'll mean nuclear proliferation, more war, more genocide, and more refugee crises, which will in turn drive more conflict. Climate change will only exacerbate these issues further, causing mass migrations and even more conflict. 

Everything we've taken for granted for decades is now up in the air and there's a real risk of systemic failure. Don't expect things to just work out, that's just normalcy bias trying to convince you not to panic. People need to stand up and push back against what Trump is doing before even more damage is done and it becomes impossible to prevent the worst case scenarios. "

**Background: Other connectors and per-pin ratings.**

The 8-pin connector that we all know and love is famously capable of handling significantly more power than it is rated for. With each pin rated to 9A per the spec, each pin can take 108W at 12V, meaning the connector has a huge safety margin. 2.16x to be exact. But that's not all, it can be taken a bit further as discussed [here](http://jongerow.com/PCIe/index.html).

The 6-pin is even more overbuilt, with 2 or 3 12V lines of the same connector type, meaning that little 75W connector is able to handle more than its entire rated power on any one of its possibly 3 power pins. You could have 2/3 of a 6-pin doing nothing and it would still have some margin left. In fact, that single-9-amp-line 6-pin would have more margin than 12VHPWR has when fully working, with 1.44x over the 75W.

In fact I am slightly derating them here myself, as many reputable brands now use mini-fit HCS (high-current system), which are good for up to 10A or even a bit more. It may even be possible for an 8-pin to carry its full 12.5A over a single 12V pin with the right connector, but I can't find one rated to a full 13A that is in the exact family used.>!If anybody knows of one, I do actually want to get some to make a *450W* *6-pin*.!< Point is, it's practically impossible for you to get a card with the correct number of 8 and 6-pin connectors to ever melt a connector unless you intentionally mess something up or something goes horrifically wrong.

**Connector problems: Over-rated**

Now we get in to 12VHPWR. Those smaller pins are not the same mini-fit Jr family from Molex, but the even smaller micro-fit. While 16AWG wires are still able to be used, these connectors are seemingly only found in ratings up to 9.5A or 8.5A each, so now we get into the problems.

Edit: thanks to u/Emu1981 for pointing out they can handle 13A on the best pins. Additions in **(bolded parenthesis)** from now on. If any connector does use lower-rated pins, it's complete shit for the reasons here, but I still don't trust the better ones. **I have seen no evidence of these pins being in use. 9.5A is industry standard.**

The 8-pin standard asks for 150W at 12V, so 12.5A. Rounding up a bit you might say that it needs 4.5A per pin. With 9-amp connectors, each one is only at half capacity. In a 600W 12VHPWR connector, each pin is being asked for 8.33A already. If you have 8.5A pins, there is functionally no headroom here, and if you have 9.5A pins, yeah that's not great either. Those pins will fail under real-world conditions such as higher ambient temperatures, imperfect surface cleaning, and transient spikes from GPUs. The 9.5A pins are not much better. **(13A pins are probably fine on their own. Margins still aren't as good as the 8-pin, but they also aren't as bad as 9A pins would be.)**

I firmly believe that this is where the problem lies. These **(not the 13A ones)** pins are at the limit, and the margin of error of as little as 1 sixth of an amp (or 1 + 1 sixth for 9.5A pins) before you max out a pin is far too small for consumer hardware. Safety factor here is abysmal. 9.5Ax12Vx6pins = 684W, and if using 8.5A pins, 612W. The connector itself is good supposedly for up to 660W, so assuming they are allowing a slight overage on each pin, or have slightly better pins than I can find in 5 minutes on the Molex website **(they might)**, you still only have a safety factor of 1.1x.

**(For 13A pins, something else may be the limiting factor. 936W limit means a 1.56x safety factor.)**

Recall that a broken 6-pin with only 1 12V connection could still have up to 1.44x.

It's almost as if this was known about and considered to some extent. Here is a table from the 12VHPWR connector’s sense pin configuration in section 3.3 of Chapter 3 as defined in the PCIe 5.0 add-in card spec of November 2021.

[Chart noting the power limits of each configuration of 2 sense pins for the 12VHPWR standard. The open-open case is the minimum, allowing 100W at startup and 150W sustained load. The ground-ground case allows 375W at startup and 600W sustained.](https://preview.redd.it/ec6h8imo2rie1.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=acedffd6daa3b940b9b4b25fca445f96e9f2c60b)

Note that the startup power is much lower than the sustained power after software configuration. What if it didn't go up?

Then, you have 375W max going through this connector, still over 2x an 8-pin, so possibly half the PCB area for cards like a 5090 that would need 4 of them otherwise. 375W at 12V means 31.25A. Let's round that up to 32A, which puts each pin at 5.33A. That's a good amount of headroom. Not as much as the 8-pin, but given the spec now forces higher-quality components than the worst-case 8-pin from the 2000s, and there are probably >9A micro-fit pins **(there are)** out there somewhere, I find this to be acceptable. The 4080 and 5080 and below stay as one-connector cards except for select OC editions which could either have a second 12-pin or gain an 8-pin.

If we use the 648W figure for 6x9-amp pins from above, a 375W rating now has a safety factor of 1.72x. **(13A pins gets you 2.49x)** In theory, as few as 4 **(3)** pins could carry the load, with some headroom left over for a remaining factor of 1.15 **(1.25)**. This is roughly the same as the safety limit on the worst possible 8-pin with weak little 5-amp pins and 20AWG wires. Even the shittiest 7A micro-fit connectors I could find would have a safety factor of 1.34x.

The connector itself isn't bad. It is simply rated far too high **(I stand by this with the better pins)**, leaving little safety factor and thus, little room for error or imperfection. 600W should be treated as the absolute maximum power, with about 375W as a decent rated power limit.

**Nvidia's problems (and board parters too): Taking off the guard rails.**

Nvidia, as both the only GPU manufacturer currently using this connector and co-sponsor of the standard with Dell, need to take some heat for this, but their board partners are not without some blame either.

Starting with the 3090 FE and 3090ti FE, we can see that clear care was taken to balance the load across the pins of the connector, with 3 pairs selected and current balanced between them. This is classic Nvidia board design for as long as I remember. They used to do very good work on their power delivery in this sense, with my assumption being to set an example for partner boards. They are essentially treating the 12-pin as 3 8-pins in this design, balancing current between them to keep them all within 150W or so.

On both the 3090 and 3090ti FE, each pair of 12V pins has its own shunt resistor to monitor current, and some power switching hardware is present to move what I believe are individual VRM phases between the pairs. I need to probe around on the FE PCB some more that what I can gather from pictures to be sure.

Now we get to the 4090 and 5090 FE boards. Both of them combine all 6 12V pins into a single block, meaning no current balancing can be done between pins or pairs of pins. It is *literally impossible* for the 4090 and 5090, and I assume lower cards in the lineup using this connector, to balance their load as they lack any means to track beyond full connector current. Part of me wants to question the qualifications of whoever signed off on this, as I've been in their shoes with motherboards. I cannot conceive of a reason to remove a safety feature this evidently critical beyond costs, and those costs are on the order of single-digit dollars per card if not cents at industrial scale. The decision to leave it out for the 50 series after seeing the failures of 4090 cards is particularly egregious, as they now had an undeniable indication that something needed to be changed. Those connectors failed at 3/4 the rated power, and they chose to increase the power going through with no impactful changes to the power circuitry.

ASUS, and perhaps some others I am unaware of, seem to have at least tried to mitigate the danger. ASUS's ROG Astral PCB places a second bank of shunt resistors before the combination of all 12V pins into one big blob, one for each pin. As far as I can tell, they do not have the capacity to actually do anything to move loads between pins, but the card can at least be aware of any danger to both warn the user or perhaps take action itself to prevent damage or danger by power throttling or shutting down. This should be the **bare minimum** for this connector if any more than the base 375W is to be allowed through the connector.

Active power switching between 2 sets of 3 pins is the next level up, is not terribly hard to do, and would be the minimum I would accept on a card I would personally purchase. 3 by 2 pins appears to be adequate as the 3090FE cards do not appear to fail with such frequency or catastrophic results, and also falls into this category.

Monitoring and switching between all 6 pins should be mandatory for an OC model that intends to exceed 575W at all without a second connector, and personally, I would want that on anything over 500W, so every 5090 and many 4090s. I would still want multiple connectors on a card that goes that high, but that level of protection would at least let me trust a single connector a bit more.

**Future actions: Avoid, Return, and Recall**

It is my opinion that any card drawing more than the base 375W per 12VHPWR connector should be avoided. Every single-cable 4090 and 5090 is in that mix, and the 5080 is borderline at 360W.

I would like to see any cards without the minimum protections named above recalled as dangerous and potentially faulty. This will not happen without extensive legal action taken against Nvidia and board partners. They see no problem with this until people make it their problem.

If you even suspect your card may be at risk, return it and get your money back. Spend it on something else. You can do a lot with 2 grand and a bit extra. They do not deserve your money if they are going to sell you a potentially dangerous product lacking arguably critical safety mechanisms. Yes that includes AMD and Intel.

Israeli settlers backed by the army destroy the house of a christian palestinian family and seize their land.,"In this Palestinian valley west of Bethlehem, which in 2014 became a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its its olive groves and vineyards, the Kisiya family's restaurant is nothing more than a pile of ruins topped by fences.

It was a restaurant appreciated for its cuisine and friendliness in the Palestinian Christian town of Beit Jala. ""The place is beautiful, the food succulent and the owners are adorable [...]. If you're passing through Beit Jala, a stop at Al Makhrour is a must,"" a comment from 2015 reads on its Facebook page.

Ramzi Kisiya who had inherited the land opened a restaurant in 2001 there with his wife and their four children. For years, hundreds of tourists passing through Bethlehem stopped there for a salad before continuing their hike in the green valleys.

For a long time, the Makhrour valley was untouched by uncontrolled Israeli settlements, but the trouble began in 2012 when an Israeli outpost a settlement not authorised by the government - was built there.

The settlers demolished the restaurant, claiming it belonged to the JNF. The Kisiya family, who insist otherwise, rebuilt their restaurant before it was demolished again in 2013 and then again in 2015. In 2019 the family decided to take the case to court to have their rights heard. But in 2023, a civil court in Jerusalem validated the expropriation.

In a bid to prevent the family's restaurant from being rebuilt again, the Israeli army declared the site to be a ""closed military zone"", which prevented anyone from entering it until this nast summer when Israeli
settlers backed by soldiers destroyed it once again.

Israeli settlers backed by the army seized the 5,000 square-metre plot on July 31 and evicted the French-Palestinian family. ""We are being targeted because we reject the government's Zionist policy,"" said Michelle Kisiya.

Expulsions of Palestinians from their land in West Bank have increased, particularly since Israel's far-right government came to power in 2022. The situation has sharply deteriorated since Israel's invasion of Gaza last year.

The Kisiya family, who insist otherwise, rebuilt their restaurant before it was demolished again in 2013 and then again in 2015. In 2019 the family decided to take the case to court to have their rights heard. But in 2023, a civil court in Jerusalem validated the expropriation.

In a bid to prevent the family's restaurant from being rebuilt again, the Israeli army declared the site to be a ""closed military zone"", which prevented anyone from entering it until this nast summer when Israeli
settlers backed by soldiers destroyed it once again.

Israeli settlers backed by the army seized the 5,000 square-metre plot on July 31 and evicted the French-Palestinian family. ""We are being targeted because we reject the government's Zionist policy,"" said Michelle Kisiya.

Expulsions of Palestinians from their land in West Bank have increased, particularly since Israel's far-right government came to power in 2022. The situation has sharply deteriorated since Israel's invasion of Gaza last year.

# Chapter 1: The slow, tedious death of slow, tedious content

When presented with a challenge in a game, players will always try to streamline that challenge to be as efficient as possible. This will eventually show ""pain points"", the bits in the loop that players find the least interesting.

When presented with this problem as a developer, you have two variables you can adjust. One is to simplify the bits players don't like, and the other is to redesign them into something more engaging. When it comes to gathering skills, unfortunately the former has been chosen in basically every instance, and it's resulted in what effectively amounts to their death. 

### The purpose of gathering as a skill

Gathering skills were originally designed as a symbiotic component of production skills, with both existing to provide variety in the resulting gameplay loops. Mining was never meant to be an activity in and of itself to train for the sake of training, it was designed as the first step in the smithing gameplay loop. The intention was a three stage process to create weapons and armour - Mine your ore, smelt your ore into bars, smith your bars into gear. These three steps were designed together as a cohesive loop, each with a different feel to keep one activity from becoming too monotonous. While they're separate skills, they aren't separate in their design.

The same is obviously true for Mining and Crafting, Mining and Runecrafting, Woodcutting and Firemaking, Woodcutting and Fletching, Woodcutting and Construction, and Fishing and Cooking. Mining, Woodcutting, and Fishing aren't anything by themselves, instead being designed as fundamental common parts to the gameplay loop variety of the skills they support. Since multiple skills need common resources gathered, gathering skills exist as a framework to support those common resources.

### Simplification vs Complication

Over the years however, due to their relatively simplistic nature and low interactivity, gathering skills started to feel like a tedious step needed to get to *the actual skill*. They stopped being viewed as two halves of a whole, and instead just as a roadblock to the main thing. 

The solution seems obvious - All you have to do is provide an easier means of getting the resources needed to train the skill! People seemed to like combat and monsters needed interesting and valuable things to drop, why not add a new way to obtain the resources you need for production skills? It's a win-win, people do less of the content they don't like *and* monsters have value!

On the surface this always seems like the obvious fix, encourage the bits players like and simplify the bits they don't. However, this often has deeper ramifications when the nature of player optimisation is taken into account, and it starts a path which results in a far, far bigger issue than there was to begin with.

----

# Chapter 2: Runecrafting

To use an example, let's look at Runecrafting. On release the skill had a very clearly designed simple gameplay loop - Mine Rune Essence, take it to an Altar, then use the Altar to craft your runes. This isn't all that different to the loop of smithing fundamentally, with the step of smelting into bars being replaced by a longer run to the Altar, and all items being crafted at once to offset the difference.

### Vicious Cycles

On release this felt incredibly tedious, since the amount of runes produced compared to the amount you use was very low, and the xp rate was incredibly undertuned. With smithing there were two steps that offered xp in both smelting and smithing, but since the only xp for Runecrafting came all at once from clicking on the Altar, it felt like everything was a chore to get to the actual Runecrafting. 

This then fairly quickly ended up with the classic 2004 Law running meta, where players would sit at the Law altar and have noobs and bots exchange an entire inventory of essence for the crafted Law runes. This was great for the people training as it substantially sped up training the skill, but was even more boring as the actual ""work"" of the skill had been optimised away entirely.

With the speed the higher level players could get through essence, essence then started to become more and more valuable, with mining for profit becoming viable. Since the requirements were so low and the method was so easy and passive, it became a hotbed of activity for noobs and bots alike. 

We now had a situation where noobs were doing the tedious part of the skill without gain to make money and having a terrible time, bots were rampant providing the necessary resources, and skillers had optimised the skilling loop to the point where there was absolutely nothing engaging about training the skill at all. A skill that had been designed around a two phase gathering/crafting loop had been optimised down to standing in a single place, trading, and clicking on a rock, while also creating a huge economy based around an even less interactive clickable rock. Very quickly the skill had been optimised to the point where nobody was having any fun.

### Analysing the issue

So now you can see the trap - Runecrafting was tedious because the rates were too slow and the rewards weren't good enough for the designed loop. The loop was also incredibly protracted, with few steps and a *lot* of potential space for optimisation.

Compared again to Smithing, there was a lot more scope for player optimisation that resulted in the issue compounding itself into a death spiral. Common to both was skipping the Mining and just buying the resources, but that came with a high gold cost and the gold had to be earned somewhere. This kept things somewhat in balance, and in turn made the gathering skills a viable gold earner since the resources had value pressure on them.

With Smithing, both furnaces and anvils were close enough to banks that it wasn't worth employing a player to do that for you, so the optimal way was to just engage with the skill yourself as intended. With Runecrafting however, since the majority of the balancing of the skill came from the time spent running to distant Altars, there was *huge* scope for optimising that step. This resulted in the running meta, placed a huge gold sink in front of the skill, and *massively* disguised the root of the problem - You didn't get enough xp and you didn't get enough runes when engaging with the skill as designed.

You couldn't increase the xp rates and rune drops from Runecrafting while running was still an option and running was turning the skill into an expensive gold sink for the rich and a tedious borefest for the poor, so instead the approach was taken to simplify away the mining step by dropping the essence passively.

### Misguided attempts at solutions

Back in the early days, in an attempt to alleviate some of the pressure on Rune Essence to combat botting, it was added as a drop to various Slayer monsters when the skill was released. Gargoyles for example had a ~1/20 drop of 35 essence, which meant a trickle would enter the game passively to alleviate the price pressure on essence and hopefully lower botting in the mine. It would also be nice for players wishing to train the skill ""normally"", as now they were getting a bit of passive potential xp without needing to waste time in the mine. This lowered the price pressure somewhat making the skill a bit cheaper to train, but started to fundamentally erode the gathering aspect of the skill.

Fast forward to OSRS, and players weren't naive enough anymore to run essence for free. Now the value was held in the players time rather than the items generated, and the economy changed to a service economy based around running the essence. This further compounded Runecrafting's reputation as incredibly tedious, and additionally far more expensive than it had been in the past.

In 2015, Zulrah was added with a common drop of 1,500 essence. At best conventional mining could supply ~2000 an hour, so Zulrah dropped an equivalent of the maximum you could mine passively alongside everything else. For high level players you no longer had to buy or mine your essence, your best bet was just gaining it passively farming Zulrah.

[In 2016, drops from slayer monsters were increased substantially](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Superior_Slayer_Encounters). This included substantially upping the amount of Rune Essence from slayer monsters, including Gargoyles to 150 per drop. [You can clearly see on this graph](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Grand_Exchange_Market_Watch/Chart#t=Mar_23_2015,Mar_24_2025#a=0#i=Pure_essence,Daily_volume,Navigator_1) that after that update in the middle of 2016 the price of essence absolutely collapses, and it becomes quite literally worthless. 

In the years since the price of essence has reached an absolute floor of 1gp each, and now it exists in such abundance that obtaining it is functionally irrelevant to the skill. You'll just naturally obtain so much of it that it's barely even worth picking up. Every major boss had essence added to the drop table, slayer chests had them added, supply was now an absolute non-issue.

As such, Runecrafting has been optimised into *entirely* the crafting step. This then meant that even for people wanting to train it traditionally, there was nothing to break up the monotony of running back and forth to the altars, and the skill became *even more* boring than it already was. Sure the relative xp rates were higher since training was now exclusively focused on the crafting, but in trying to optimise a pain point we ended up with a skill that was even less enjoyable to train, and the relevance of Mining as a gathering skill to support other skills further diminished making training Mining feel even more irrelevant.

### Course correction, too little too late

Since then, efforts have been made to attempt to course correct and add the mining step back into the skill. The first was the Kourend altars, which required a specific untradable item be mined near to them to force not using Pure Essence. There was also the Daeyalt essance mine, with again untradable essence that this time increased the xp from crafting the runes to try and offset the time spent mining in comparison to just running regular essence. The other big ""fix"" for the skill was Guardians of the Rift, which is incredibly fun but essentially a replacement minigame for the entire skill. 

These all at least understand the core problem with Runecrafting, and by making the essence untradable and requiring it be mined force the player to engage with both the mining and the running aspects of the skill. Daeyalt goes one step further and fixes the issue with xp rates, but ultimately it's fixing it by just superceeding the original rather than actually fixing it.

----

# Chapter 3: Farming

I deliberately didn't include it in my list earlier, but in the modern game Farming is fundamentally the symbiotic gathering skill to Herblore. It was added much later than the other gathering skills and as such is a lot more fleshed out, but at its core it's a gathering skill to provide herbs for Herblore. 

Compared to the other gathering skills however, it adds an extra step which makes it much easier to balance - Seeds.

### Seeds

Seeds are the answer to preventing drops from eliminating gathering skills entirely. Instead of adding herbs directly to boss drop tables, you can instead add the seeds. This gives the player a valuable drop from bosses that helps with their herblore training, but also doesn't entirely skip the gathering skill. It also allows you to *substantially* speed up the gathering skill itself, by offering much, much higher xp rewards and a much faster collection rate for resources. 

Look at Snapdragons for example, with some notable recent exceptions (which I believe to be a fundamental mistake), barely anything dropped them. However, *everything* drops snapdragon seeds. This means that fundamentally for the resources to come into the game, the gathering skill needs to be engaged with. This has resulted in a really stable two stage economy, with bosses dropping valuable rewards that help with skilling, and players being able to earn gold by engaging with a gathering skill to produce items. Herb runs are a profitable gathering skill, and it *works*.

### Dailyscape

The issue with Farming, however, is that the skill itself is gated to be disengaging. You teleport to all of your herb patches every few hours, harvest, compost, plant, tele. The actual active time spent training farming is incredibly low, balanced out by high xp rates and the forced waiting. 

This further compounds itself with tree runs, which are objectively the fastest and most efficient way to train the skill and are absolutely, truly, utterly awful. And I say that as someone who actually likes Farming. The best way to train farming is to get absolutely insane xp rates for incredibly short periods every day, and your efficiency isn't the effort you put in or time spent training the skill, but instead how frequently you train the skill.

### Streamlining and simplification

Once again however, we come to see how Farming, like other gathering skills, has been streamlined and simplified. The original loop for farming was actually quite involved and engaging, expecting you to rake, compost, frequently water, and then keep an eye on your crops to prevent disease. Then once they're grown, harvest them. You'd then use your crops to create compost, and the better crops you produced the better your compost.

Over the years, slowly but surely all of those aspects have been optimised away. Auto-weed was added to prevent the need to rake, the bottomless bucket was added to halve the amount of compost you needed and simplify the inventory management, watering was found to be absolutely pointless, tending to the crops was superceeded by both protection, the White Lily, disease-free patches, and just expecting x% to die, and even the needed tools were simplified with barbarian planting.

Now the skill is faster, but less engaging. You turn up, harvest, note on the Leprechaun, plant, compost, and leave. You don't need to return until you know they're grown, and then you do it all again. With tree runs it's even simpler, paying the gardener to remove the tree instantly, planting, and then paying for protection. The majority of time spent engaging with the skill now is either travelling to a patch or the actual harvesting step, which brings me nicely to the next point.

### Spades

One of the new potential rewards from the delve boss is a spade that harvests crops more quickly. Cool! It's a shame it's coming from PvM instead of something farming related, but it's flavourful and improves a ""pain point"" with farming, in that harvesting takes a while.

I saw some people theorycrafting that mass snape grass with instant gathering could actually be faster effective xp/hr than tree runs are at present, which on the surface sounds great to me. Allotments *should* be a viable way to train the skill! There should be a more active method than tree runs that rewards higher effective xp, and (dailyscape issues aside) tree runs should be a slower, more passive method that you do in the background like Birdhouses are to Hunter. 

Actively running around to all of the allotments, planting something and harvesting when you get to the end of the loop should be a better way to actively train than engaging for 30 seconds every day, but as things are, trees are both the lowest engagement *and* the highest xp. So that's definitely the way to improve farming - Buff snape grass so that it's a viable, higher effort alternative to tree runs! And the spade making it faster is a great way to do that!

...yes?

### No.

The reason I'm actually writing this post is after seeing discussion on the new spade, and a large pro-spade backlash to the backlash. While it seems like a really nice little reward ""It speeds up a boring thing you're doing!"", to me under the surface it's actually yet another concerning slide towards optimising away engagement. Since the majority of time spent farming is actually now the harvesting step, speeding that up even by half will remove yet more engagement out of the skill.

If the spade was added in its original form, what even is farming? You turn up to a patch, click to harvest, click twice to compost, click twice to plant, and leave all within about 6 seconds. Suddenly the bulk of time spent on the skill is no longer engaging with farming, it's basically just pulling everything out of your bank and running to the plots. Because tree runs are the benchmark for efficiency right now and they're both incredibly high xp and incredibly low engagement, they feel like the ideal to be aimed for. This, however, is another symptom of the optimisation mindset that is slowly but surely sapping away any gathering engagement from skills, resulting in them feeling worse rather than better. What farming actually needs is *more* interactivity, not less. If you're going to add a reward to improve it, it should be more steps, not fewer. 

Say for example if the spade could be used on the plot after harvesting to turn over the soil, improving yield on your next trip. It improves xp rates and items per seed so and is an objective buff, but it makes the skill more engaging and actually increases the time you spend interacting. It adds an extra action to your planting and it adds additional actions to your harvesting, for the benefit of more resources and more xp. That's why compost exists, you trade off additional actions for additional reward.

Incentivising active farming would be a huge benefit to the skill, and would go a long way to making it feel like less of a tedious chore. Tree runs should be disincentivised not only because they're too powerful in terms of efficient xp, but also because they're inherently unengaging and promote an incredibly negative playstyle and interaction with the skill. They don't need to be removed entirely, but as I mentioned earlier, like birdhouses they should only be a passive bonus to active training rather than a wholesale replacement.

Looking at ""It speeds up a boring thing you're doing"" again, this gets right to the heart of what I've been outlining. By speeding up the boring thing instead of adding variety to make the boring thing a smaller facet of the whole, you end up optimising to a point where things feel *even worse* in the long run. The more you streamline, the less you have to do, and the worse things get.

# Conclusion

I'm sorry about how wordy this is, but I've been thinking about this for a long time. We're getting to a point where the cracks are really starting to show, and I think a big change in direction is needed to prevent the beast from growing to an unmanagable size. 

I think there needs to be a substantial look at all of the core gathering skills, and I think they need to be reintegrated into skill training loops as a symbiotic and engaging part, not a separate chore. Doing that makes both the gathering skill feel less pointless, and adds variation and variety into the loop for the production skill.

The root cause of the issues for a lot of them in the modern game is direct resource drops from bosses, as they cause a negative feedback loop disincentivising gathering and causing production to be far less varied. I personally think the solution is for bosses to drop something that creates high efficiency resource gathering, such as herb seeds for Farming and Herblore, and for production skills to rely more on their gathering loops again.

Hopefully what I've described makes sense, because at the end of the day I want to play the game. The more things are sped up, streamlined, and automated, the less of the game there actually is to play. Buffs shouldn't incentivise engaging less, they should give you additional benefit for engaging more.",3823,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1jjeowf/optimising_the_fun_out_of_a_game_by_removing_pain/,1742891581.0,2007scape,"Optimising the fun out of a game by removing pain points, and the death of gathering skills A lot of items and changes that have come into the game over the last few years have been to alleviate ""pain points"", and make certain tedious or slow things simpler or faster.

Auto-weed was added to prevent the need to rake, the bottomless bucket was added to halve the amount of compost you needed and simplify the inventory management, watering was found to be absolutely pointless, tending to the crops was superceeded by both protection, the White Lily, disease-free patches, and just expecting x% to die, and even the needed tools were simplified with barbarian planting.

Now the skill is faster, but less engaging. You turn up, harvest, note on the Leprechaun, plant, compost, and leave. You don't need to return until you know they're grown, and then you do it all again. With tree runs it's even simpler, paying the gardener to remove the tree instantly, planting, and then paying for protection. The majority of time spent engaging with the skill now is either travelling to a patch or the actual harvesting step, which brings me nicely to the next point.

### Spades

One of the new potential rewards from the delve boss is a spade that harvests crops more quickly. Cool! It's a shame it's coming from PvM instead of something farming related, but it's flavourful and improves a ""pain point"" with farming, in that harvesting takes a while.

I saw some people theorycrafting that mass snape grass with instant gathering could actually be faster effective xp/hr than tree runs are at present, which on the surface sounds great to me. Allotments *should* be a viable way to train the skill! There should be a more active method than tree runs that rewards higher effective xp, and (dailyscape issues aside) tree runs should be a slower, more passive method that you do in the background like Birdhouses are to Hunter. 

Actively running around to all of the allotments, planting something and harvesting when you get to the end of the loop should be a better way to actively train than engaging for 30 seconds every day, but as things are, trees are both the lowest engagement *and* the highest xp. So that's definitely the way to improve farming - Buff snape grass so that it's a viable, higher effort alternative to tree runs! And the spade making it faster is a great way to do that!

...yes?

### No.

The reason I'm actually writing this post is after seeing discussion on the new spade, and a large pro-spade backlash to the backlash. While it seems like a really nice little reward ""It speeds up a boring thing you're doing!"", to me under the surface it's actually yet another concerning slide towards optimising away engagement. Since the majority of time spent farming is actually now the harvesting step, speeding that up even by half will remove yet more engagement out of the skill.

If the spade was added in its original form, what even is farming? You turn up to a patch, click to harvest, click twice to compost, click twice to plant, and leave all within about 6 seconds. Suddenly the bulk of time spent on the skill is no longer engaging with farming, it's basically just pulling everything out of your bank and running to the plots. Because tree runs are the benchmark for efficiency right now and they're both incredibly high xp and incredibly low engagement, they feel like the ideal to be aimed for. This, however, is another symptom of the optimisation mindset that is slowly but surely sapping away any gathering engagement from skills, resulting in them feeling worse rather than better. What farming actually needs is *more* interactivity, not less. If you're going to add a reward to improve it, it should be more steps, not fewer. 

Say for example if the spade could be used on the plot after harvesting to turn over the soil, improving yield on your next trip. It improves xp rates and items per seed so and is an objective buff, but it makes the skill more engaging and actually increases the time you spend interacting. It adds an extra action to your planting and it adds additional actions to your harvesting, for the benefit of more resources and more xp. That's why compost exists, you trade off additional actions for additional reward.

Incentivising active farming would be a huge benefit to the skill, and would go a long way to making it feel like less of a tedious chore. Tree runs should be disincentivised not only because they're too powerful in terms of efficient xp, but also because they're inherently unengaging and promote an incredibly negative playstyle and interaction with the skill. They don't need to be removed entirely, but as I mentioned earlier, like birdhouses they should only be a passive bonus to active training rather than a wholesale replacement.

Looking at ""It speeds up a boring thing you're doing"" again, this gets right to the heart of what I've been outlining. By speeding up the boring thing instead of adding variety to make the boring thing a smaller facet of the whole, you end up optimising to a point where things feel *even worse* in the long run. The more you streamline, the less you have to do, and the worse things get.

# Conclusion

I'm sorry about how wordy this is, but I've been thinking about this for a long time. We're getting to a point where the cracks are really starting to show, and I think a big change in direction is needed to prevent the beast from growing to an unmanagable size. 

I think there needs to be a substantial look at all of the core gathering skills, and I think they need to be reintegrated into skill training loops as a symbiotic and engaging part, not a separate chore. Doing that makes both the gathering skill feel less pointless, and adds variation and variety into the loop for the production skill.

The root cause of the issues for a lot of them in the modern game is direct resource drops from bosses, as they cause a negative feedback loop disincentivising gathering and causing production to be far less varied. I personally think the solution is for bosses to drop something that creates high efficiency resource gathering, such as herb seeds for Farming and Herblore, and for production skills to rely more on their gathering loops again.

Hopefully what I've described makes sense, because at the end of the day I want to play the game. The more things are sped up, streamlined, and automated, the less of the game there actually is to play. Buffs shouldn't incentivise engaging less, they should give you additional benefit for engaging more."
My boomer dad is pissed I won’t give him babys SS#,"That’s right. My dad thinks I should just give him my kid’s SS# like it’s no big deal. He wants to start a bank account for my little guy.

When I moved out at 20 I found out they had overdue utility bills in my name so I couldn’t open up any accounts for my first apartment until I paid it off for them. They took money from me as a minor while I was working at my first job and emptied 1500 from my savings account, never paid it back to this day. I don’t trust them at all.

I politely told my dad/ parents that baby already has a savings account and they can contribute to that if they like. Boy did they flip the fck out. Demands baby’s ssn and starts calling us names. I flat out say no at this point. I tell them they didnt need a ss# to open a savings account in which baby is beneficiary, they counter that they do. 

They then proceed to tell me my baby won’t receive any money from them until they get it. Don’t care. Pretty sure they don’t have shit anyways besides the inheritance money after my grandparents died that they are literally smoking through. My dad even had my grandpa change his will less than 6 months before his death and showing signs of dementia. My grandpa right before he died asked me what my dad had him sign and showed me the new will asking me to translate it, it was leaving the (us) grandkids out and Dad was sole proprietor, executor, and power of attorney. Everything was changed. No point in contesting it, Hubby and I want to cut ties and move far far away anyhow, we could not care less over 10 or 15k. 

Just more ways they abuse money and positions of power.  

I called one of the top 5 nationwide banks in the U.S. and they say you don’t. Either way, it’s not happening. They tried to corner my husband behind my back and he didn’t budge either. The anger continues. Snide comments at every holiday so far and baby’s birthday is coming up. I don’t care. My idiot brother dolled out his kid’s ssn without consent from his wife or thinking about it. My parents say I don’t “trust them”. No shit. 

Someone with “good intentions” doesn’t get this angry.

Keeping them on a carrot and stick relationship and letting them think they have any control when they don’t works for us.

As for my nephew, he is a few months older than my kiddo. Born in the same year. I have discussed my concerns and thats all I can do. It is their choice what to do next.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/L8Rzn5olWj): **January 3, 2025**

My (24f) brother (32m) is a failure to launch. He’s never been very smart. He did badly in school, and never went to college. He tried two different trade schools, welding and mechanic, but he basically flunked out of both. He works at a gas station now.

My brother and I are our parent’s only children. They always treated us relatively equal, until adulthood. They always insisted we earn our own way, they refused to pay for college or anything. I joined the military at 17, got an associates degree while I was in, and my GI bill went towards my bachelors. I’m working towards my masters now. My husband and I have bought a house and have done well for ourselves.

My parents however fully paid for my brother to try trade school twice. They’ve given him cash when he was behind on rent, and countless ‘loans’. They support him cosplaying as an adult, meanwhile they never paid for my wedding, education, nothing. I don’t really care so much that they didn’t give me money, but the disparity in how they’ve treated me vs my brother.

Our parents are in their sixties now, and while they aren’t that old, they’re both in bad health and probably won’t live another ten years. They just recently started working on their will, and notified us that they were leaving almost everything to my brother. But they want me to be their medical power of attorney, manage their estate, etc.

I told my parents to give my brother everything, and that I’m completely done with them. They told me to have some grace, and understand the fact that he isnt very capable and needs their support, even after they’re gone.

My mother had a doctors appointment this morning, and asked me for a ride since she medically can’t work. I told her to ask her favorite child or pay for an Uber.

Things have been tense and hostile. My brother called me to apologize, and asked me to not be mad at him, but I told him that I’m not mad at him, I’m mad at our parents for not treating us equally, and he didn’t do anything wrong.

AITAH?

I meant to put disabled in quotation marks. My mother refers to my brother as disabled even though he isn’t. She’s had him tested for every kind of learning disability there is. He just has a below average IQ. She thinks that counts as a disability when it isn’t.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received mixed reactions**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** He does not sound disabled to me if he went to two different trade schools, welding and mechanic just lazy.

Odds are if he gets the money it'll not last him long then he'll be looking to you to pay his bills.

> **OOP:** He’s not disabled, but he’s very unintelligent and has poor critical thinking skills. He doesn’t really understand how to manage money at all, despite having been taught how.

**How is OOP’s brother disabled? (medical issues, etc)**

> **OOP:** He’s not, he’s just unintelligent. I meant to put disabled in quotation marks. My mother refers to him as disabled but he’s been tested and has no actual disabilities. My mother thinks being dumb is a disability.

**Commenter 2:** If his IQ is that low he is intellectually disabled. An IQ below 75 is considered intellectually impaired. It doesn't excuse the implied favoritism.

> **OOP:** When they had us tested mine was 131 I believe, and his was around 80? It’s been so many years I’m having a hard time remembering. It definitely was above the cutoff for being considered intellectually disabled, because I remember them being surprised that he scored above it.

**Did OOP plan to take care of her parents when they get old?**

> **OOP:** I originally was going to take care of them in their old age, but I now have decided they’re going to a nursing home if it’s up to me. I’m done.

**Commenter 3:** “But they want me to be their medical power of attorney, manage their estate, etc.”

This is a HUGE ask even if you stood to inherit. That you’re expected to do all the heavy lifting and then be your brothers keeper after they pass is…it’s a helluva lot. 

**Why can’t OOP’s brother live with their parents to take care of them?**

> **OOP:** They don’t want to ask him. He’s forgetful and they probably wouldn’t be able to rely on him anyways.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/wHAePYzlOa): **January 5, 2025 (two days later)**

Hey. So the consensus on my post was a bit of a mixed bag. I sat down with my parents and I wanted to give an update and answer some stuff.

My brother is not actually disabled. He just has a low IQ, just over 80. You need an IQ under 70 where I live to be considered disabled and to qualify for any sort of benefits. My parents have babied him because from a young age he wasn’t as smart as other kids, and had a low self esteem because of that, and was quick to give up on things when they seemed too hard. He does ok on his own now. He works and pays his bills most of the time. He drives and lives with a roommate.

On to the update, I sat down with my parents and explained that I’ve always felt like they treated me worse than my brother. They always emphasized to me that as an adult you need to support yourself, and figure things out on your own. I had to join the military at 17 because I knew they’d kick me out when I was 18. My parents never offered me any support outside of raising me as a child. They didn’t buy my husband and I a wedding gift, they didn’t offer much of anything. Meanwhile they brag about having over a million dollars in the bank, and having succeeded from nothing.

Meanwhile they paid to put my brother through two trade schools that he failed out of, offered him money to start his own business. They’ve always bailed him out when he was short on rent.

For me it’s not so much about the money, but about the disparity in how we’ve been treated. It’s obvious that they loved and cared him him more, because they were willing to do these things for him, and not me.

But despite them not being there for me, I’ve still done really well in life. I told my parents about all of this, and they were interrupting me and talking over me the whole time. They told me I’m not entitled a to dime when they die, and that I’m an adult and I can handle myself. They just weren’t understanding or even caring about my point. They told me I need to step up and treat them better, and that it’s wrong of me to not take my sick mother to the doctor or take care of her because of money.

Eventually I just gave up on trying to talk about my feelings. They just don’t care. I told them that they’re adults, and they’re not entitled to anything from me. Just like how they were never required to help me, I’m not required to help me. I told them to complete remove me from their will, I’m not willing to be their estate executor, medical power of attorney, nothing. I don’t want a dime from them at this point, and I suggested they spend all the money they’ve saved over the years to pay for really good nursing homes, and an estate executor, because I’m no longer willing to do anything for them.

My mother was floored, and asked if I’d really put my own parents in a nursing home. I asked if they’d really let their 17 year old daughter join the army to get sexually harassed by older men in order to go to school without taking on a huge debt.

My parents cried and yelled at me. And I left. And that’s that I guess. I kind of feel relieved, like a massive weight is off my shoulders. I have a wonderful husband, we own a nice home. I’m getting ready to start working on my masters degree, and we’re thinking about maybe having a baby soon. I no longer have to worry about dealing with my parents. They’re adults and they can deal with their own problems, just like I’ve done with mine. And yeah, that’s it. Not sure if it’s the update we wanted, but it is what it is.

Tdlr: My parents wanted to leave almost everything to my older brother because he’s not as successful in life. I feel like my parents have always favored him over me. My parents don’t care about my feelings and won’t listen to them, so I told them our relationship is over. I don’t want anything from them at this point, and I’m moving on.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Honestly, I would have cut them off at the wedding if they had a million dollars and didn’t even give me a 20$ vase or SOMETHING! Who shows up to a wedding empty handed?

> **OOP:** I’ve been to a lot of weddings and I would never show up without a wedding gift. It’s rude. Not to mention my in laws actually paid for the entire wedding, and my cheap parents became a major talking point. It was very embarrassing.

**Commenter 2:** NTA.

Your parents are TAs.

I know this might be a sucky suggestion, but you may need to go NC with your brother as well. He’ll be stuck with their care, and there’s going to be a high likelihood they’ll tell him to reach out to you for help. Or your brother may take the easy way out and stick them in a nursing home, which they totally deserve.

> **OOP:** My brothers not a terrible guy. He makes bad choices sometimes but at the end of the day he’s still my older brother, and he’s tries to be good to me. I wouldn’t cut him off without a good reason.

**Commenter 3:** NTA I like how they told you that you're an adult and not entitled to their help and you threw those words right back in their faces.

**Commenter 4:** They tell you they’re not leaving you a dime… yet expect you to care for them in their old age, drive them places and handle the estate when they die?? 😂

Do they not see how ludicrous they are???

**Commenter 5:** They’ve spent so long using you as their personal doormat they’re not even able to break from their delusion that you’ll keep presenting your face for them to step on. 

Congrats on your newfound freedom.

I told my parents to give my brother everything, and that I’m completely done with them. They told me to have some grace, and understand the fact that he isnt very capable and needs their support, even after they’re gone.

My mother had a doctors appointment this morning, and asked me for a ride since she medically can’t work. I told her to ask her favorite child or pay for an Uber.

Things have been tense and hostile. My brother called me to apologize, and asked me to not be mad at him, but I told him that I’m not mad at him, I’m mad at our parents for not treating us equally, and he didn’t do anything wrong.

AITAH?

I meant to put disabled in quotation marks. My mother refers to my brother as disabled even though he isn’t. She’s had him tested for every kind of learning disability there is. He just has a below average IQ. She thinks that counts as a disability when it isn’t.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received mixed reactions**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** He does not sound disabled to me if he went to two different trade schools, welding and mechanic just lazy.

Odds are if he gets the money it'll not last him long then he'll be looking to you to pay his bills.

> **OOP:** He’s not disabled, but he’s very unintelligent and has poor critical thinking skills. He doesn’t really understand how to manage money at all, despite having been taught how.

**How is OOP’s brother disabled? (medical issues, etc)**

> **OOP:** He’s not, he’s just unintelligent. I meant to put disabled in quotation marks. My mother refers to him as disabled but he’s been tested and has no actual disabilities. My mother thinks being dumb is a disability.

**Commenter 2:** If his IQ is that low he is intellectually disabled. An IQ below 75 is considered intellectually impaired. It doesn't excuse the implied favoritism.

> **OOP:** When they had us tested mine was 131 I believe, and his was around 80? It’s been so many years I’m having a hard time remembering. It definitely was above the cutoff for being considered intellectually disabled, because I remember them being surprised that he scored above it.

**Did OOP plan to take care of her parents when they get old?**

> **OOP:** I originally was going to take care of them in their old age, but I now have decided they’re going to a nursing home if it’s up to me. I’m done.

**Commenter 3:** “But they want me to be their medical power of attorney, manage their estate, etc.”

This is a HUGE ask even if you stood to inherit. That you’re expected to do all the heavy lifting and then be your brothers keeper after they pass is…it’s a helluva lot. 

**Why can’t OOP’s brother live with their parents to take care of them?**

> **OOP:** They don’t want to ask him. He’s forgetful and they probably wouldn’t be able to rely on him anyways.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/wHAePYzlOa): **January 5, 2025 (two days later)**

Hey. So the consensus on my post was a bit of a mixed bag. I sat down with my parents and I wanted to give an update and answer some stuff.

My brother is not actually disabled. He just has a low IQ, just over 80. You need an IQ under 70 where I live to be considered disabled and to qualify for any sort of benefits. My parents have babied him because from a young age he wasn’t as smart as other kids, and had a low self esteem because of that, and was quick to give up on things when they seemed too hard. He does ok on his own now. He works and pays his bills most of the time. He drives and lives with a roommate.

On to the update, I sat down with my parents and explained that I’ve always felt like they treated me worse than my brother. They always emphasized to me that as an adult you need to support yourself, and figure things out on your own. I had to join the military at 17 because I knew they’d kick me out when I was 18. My parents never offered me any support outside of raising me as a child. They didn’t buy my husband and I a wedding gift, they didn’t offer much of anything. Meanwhile they brag about having over a million dollars in the bank, and having succeeded from nothing.

Meanwhile they paid to put my brother through two trade schools that he failed out of, offered him money to start his own business. They’ve always bailed him out when he was short on rent.

For me it’s not so much about the money, but about the disparity in how we’ve been treated. It’s obvious that they loved and cared him him more, because they were willing to do these things for him, and not me.

But despite them not being there for me, I’ve still done really well in life. I told my parents about all of this, and they were interrupting me and talking over me the whole time. They told me I’m not entitled a to dime when they die, and that I’m an adult and I can handle myself. They just weren’t understanding or even caring about my point. They told me I need to step up and treat them better, and that it’s wrong of me to not take my sick mother to the doctor or take care of her because of money.

Eventually I just gave up on trying to talk about my feelings. They just don’t care. I told them that they’re adults, and they’re not entitled to anything from me. Just like how they were never required to help me, I’m not required to help me. I told them to complete remove me from their will, I’m not willing to be their estate executor, medical power of attorney, nothing. I don’t want a dime from them at this point, and I suggested they spend all the money they’ve saved over the years to pay for really good nursing homes, and an estate executor, because I’m no longer willing to do anything for them.

My mother was floored, and asked if I’d really put my own parents in a nursing home. I asked if they’d really let their 17 year old daughter join the army to get sexually harassed by older men in order to go to school without taking on a huge debt.

My parents cried and yelled at me. And I left. And that’s that I guess. I kind of feel relieved, like a massive weight is off my shoulders. I have a wonderful husband, we own a nice home. I’m getting ready to start working on my masters degree, and we’re thinking about maybe having a baby soon. I no longer have to worry about dealing with my parents. They’re adults and they can deal with their own problems, just like I’ve done with mine. And yeah, that’s it. Not sure if it’s the update we wanted, but it is what it is.

Tdlr: My parents wanted to leave almost everything to my older brother because he’s not as successful in life. I feel like my parents have always favored him over me. My parents don’t care about my feelings and won’t listen to them, so I told them our relationship is over. I don’t want anything from them at this point, and I’m moving on.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Honestly, I would have cut them off at the wedding if they had a million dollars and didn’t even give me a 20$ vase or SOMETHING! Who shows up to a wedding empty handed?

> **OOP:** I’ve been to a lot of weddings and I would never show up without a wedding gift. It’s rude. Not to mention my in laws actually paid for the entire wedding, and my cheap parents became a major talking point. It was very embarrassing.

**Commenter 2:** NTA.

Your parents are TAs.

I know this might be a sucky suggestion, but you may need to go NC with your brother as well. He’ll be stuck with their care, and there’s going to be a high likelihood they’ll tell him to reach out to you for help. Or your brother may take the easy way out and stick them in a nursing home, which they totally deserve.

> **OOP:** My brothers not a terrible guy. He makes bad choices sometimes but at the end of the day he’s still my older brother, and he’s tries to be good to me. I wouldn’t cut him off without a good reason.

**Commenter 3:** NTA I like how they told you that you're an adult and not entitled to their help and you threw those words right back in their faces.

**Commenter 4:** They tell you they’re not leaving you a dime… yet expect you to care for them in their old age, drive them places and handle the estate when they die?? 😂

Do they not see how ludicrous they are???

**Commenter 5:** They’ve spent so long using you as their personal doormat they’re not even able to break from their delusion that you’ll keep presenting your face for them to step on. 

Congrats on your newfound freedom.

"Elon Musk has called to ""delete"" the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau","Elon Musk on Wednesday called for the elimination of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, one of the nation’s most powerful watchdog agencies, signaling it could be scrapped as part of a planned review of government spending ordered by President-elect Donald Trump.

“Delete CFPB,” Musk said in an early-morning post on X, the social media site he owns, categorizing the bureau as an example of “too many duplicative regulatory agencies” in Washington.

Formed in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis, the CFPB has a broad mandate to protect Americans from unfair, deceptive or predatory financial practices. Its current director — Rohit Chopra, a Democrat — has recently issued rules meant to shield people from medical debt, make it easier for them to switch banks and limit the fees they face from falling behind on their credit card bills.

Since its founding, the CFPB has secured more than $19 billion in consumer relief, while penalizing large financial institutions and technology firms for allegedly mishandling Americans’ money. Its oversight often has stoked the ire of the nation’s biggest banks, credit card companies and other lenders, which have sued the bureau repeatedly over charges of regulatory overreach.

Some things in Germany that I feel like are a scam,"I have been living here for the past 6 years and there are a lot of things that have shaped my experience. For me, in general, Germany is a nice place to live. I like the emphasis on worker's right, a calm lifestyle, access to nature and a strong social system as solid postives of living here. However, at the same time, I must say there are some things operating here that seem unusual, and to me they are operating more like a mafia. Usually people are bound to them in one way or another, with no recourse for complains.

Some of them I feel like are the following:

**SCHUFA:** So I was really surprised that a private company is allowed information about my finicial activity by all banks, and then they rate me on the basis of this information? Isn't there a possibility of abuse in this scenario? Since the metric by which SCHUFA arrive at their ratings are not public, how can anyone be sure that the company is not operating in an abusive manner? And I see no action by the Government to either force SCHUFA to reveal their rating methods or to come up with a public entity that does the same thing.


**ARD:** I understand the importance of a free, independent and impartial media without any government bias, heck I use tagesschau.de daily for news and consider it an important resource. But does it really cost so much to maintain it all? 18,36€ per month is and unfair amount and since it is not a tax, but rather a fee/contribution, it is not proporational to income and can be a lot for some people. And I feel like due to the demographics, there is not much content for young people. My suggestion would be to cut down on the fee so that we are only paying for the essentials such as news and weather information, and anyone who wants to watch those shitty soap operas or Krimis, can pay extra. But of course, how else would the members of the Rundfunkräte get millions into their pension funds?


**Driving License:** I feel like this is not essential to living life, since in many cities you can get by using the public transport or keeping a bicycle. But still at one point in time it makes sense to at least have a license since you never know when you might need one. The problem here is that the whole process is tiring as hell. So you mean to say that I have to learn at the place/town I am registered in even though the license is valid all over the EU? And I cannot learn in another country where it is cheaper, even though the license of that country is also valid EU wide? I don't understand the logic behind this and I feel like the government is enabling the shitty behaviour of driving schools. Also if I pass the theory exam and then if within one year I cannot clear the practical part due to any reason (life getting in the way, any incident etc.), then I have to take the theory classes and exam again? Do they really think I forgot everything in just 1 year? Also why do I have to pay like 60€ for a fucking app to practice the theory test? If the questions are all public why are they not available online for practice? Or in a cheaper booklet form?



This list is not exhaustive, and I know there are a lot of other things that I forgot to mention. But I believe many people are fed up of the things I listed above in one way or another.

I know the German aversion to change, but sometimes its at the detriment of people coming in from other parts of the world. Overhaul is needed in many aspects of life but I think things here move at a snail's pace.

Anyone is encouraged to add more things they think act like a scam.

First of all, I would like to thank everyone that took the time to read and to reply. And thank you all for adding great additions as well. I feel comfort in knowing that I am not the only one complaining about these things, but a lot of people are bothered as well.

How long does a trip have to be for you to bring a power bank?,"I’m curious what people’s trip length thresholds are for bringing a power bank.

JD Vance Finally Admits What Trump’s Big Plan to Lower Food Prices Is - The plan is no plan.,"Vice President JD Vance wants you to believe that Donald Trump will bring down grocery prices, even if he can’t spell out the nitty gritty of how it’s going to be accomplished.

Speaking with [CBS’](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1883541462736130282)s Margaret Brennan on Sunday, the vice president insisted that the price of food would come down—but couldn’t muster up any details on exactly how or when that would happen.

“You campaigned on lowering prices for consumers. We’ve seen all these executive orders. Which one lowers prices?” asked Brennan.

“We have done a lot,” Vance said. “And there have been a number of executive orders that have caused, already, jobs to start coming back into our country, which is a core part of lowering prices. More capital investment, more job creation in our economy, is one of the things that’s going to drive down prices for all consumers but also raise wages so that people can afford to buy the things they need.”

“So grocery prices aren’t going to come down?” Brennan interjected.

“No, no, Margaret, prices are going to come down, but it’s going to take a little bit of time,” Vance continued, claiming that Trump has so far used the power of his office to accomplish more in five days than President Joe Biden did during his entire term.

“The way that you lower prices is that you encourage more capital investment into our country,” Vance added.

But even with just one week in the bank, prices of some common grocery items are going up, not down, thanks to one of Trump’s most [controversial economic policies](https://newrepublic.com/post/189144/donald-trump-defend-economic-plan-tariffs): aggressive international tariffs.

Most recently, coffee prices have [jumped](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/arabica-coffee-prices-hit-new-high-on-u-s-colombia-tariff-spat-582446fe) in the wake of Trump’s weekend [tariff dispute](https://newrepublic.com/post/190602/trump-threatens-global-trade-war-davos-tariffs) with Colombia, which saw the president threaten a 25 percent tariff increase against one of America’s strongest allies in Latin America, in order to force the country to accept the use of military aircraft to receive deportees out of the U.S.

Approximately 20 percent of the U.S coffee supply comes from Colombia. It’s second only to Brazil, which has failed to produce its typical yield while suffering through record temperatures and the [worst drought](https://apnews.com/article/brazil-climate-change-drought-coffee-harvest-a6516a4b314e6ba7c11513c08afb6996) in more than seven decades.

Meanwhile, Trump’s favorite TV network celebrated the price hike on Monday, saying on live air that rising consumer prices would be worth the cost if it successfully pushed immigrants out of the country.

“Ultimately, would you pay an extra quarter on a cup of coffee to send those people back?” *Fox & Friends* co-host Steve Doocy [asked](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fox-friends-colombia-trump-tariffs-b2687067.html), to which Brian Kilmeade replied: “Yes!”

The co-hosts’ solution? Buy cheaper coffee options at the grocery store.

Trump—who claimed he won in November based on his promise to lower grocery costs—suddenly [changed his tune](https://newrepublic.com/post/189301/donald-trump-no-idea-inflation) in December, telling *Time* that “it’s hard to bring things down once they’re up.”

Vice President JD Vance wants you to believe that Donald Trump will bring down grocery prices, even if he can’t spell out the nitty gritty of how it’s going to be accomplished.

Speaking with [CBS’](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1883541462736130282)s Margaret Brennan on Sunday, the vice president insisted that the price of food would come down—but couldn’t muster up any details on exactly how or when that would happen.

“You campaigned on lowering prices for consumers. We’ve seen all these executive orders. Which one lowers prices?” asked Brennan.

“We have done a lot,” Vance said. “And there have been a number of executive orders that have caused, already, jobs to start coming back into our country, which is a core part of lowering prices. More capital investment, more job creation in our economy, is one of the things that’s going to drive down prices for all consumers but also raise wages so that people can afford to buy the things they need.”

“So grocery prices aren’t going to come down?” Brennan interjected.

“No, no, Margaret, prices are going to come down, but it’s going to take a little bit of time,” Vance continued, claiming that Trump has so far used the power of his office to accomplish more in five days than President Joe Biden did during his entire term.

“The way that you lower prices is that you encourage more capital investment into our country,” Vance added.

But even with just one week in the bank, prices of some common grocery items are going up, not down, thanks to one of Trump’s most [controversial economic policies](https://newrepublic.com/post/189144/donald-trump-defend-economic-plan-tariffs): aggressive international tariffs.

Most recently, coffee prices have [jumped](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/arabica-coffee-prices-hit-new-high-on-u-s-colombia-tariff-spat-582446fe) in the wake of Trump’s weekend [tariff dispute](https://newrepublic.com/post/190602/trump-threatens-global-trade-war-davos-tariffs) with Colombia, which saw the president threaten a 25 percent tariff increase against one of America’s strongest allies in Latin America, in order to force the country to accept the use of military aircraft to receive deportees out of the U.S.

Approximately 20 percent of the U.S coffee supply comes from Colombia. It’s second only to Brazil, which has failed to produce its typical yield while suffering through record temperatures and the [worst drought](https://apnews.com/article/brazil-climate-change-drought-coffee-harvest-a6516a4b314e6ba7c11513c08afb6996) in more than seven decades.

Meanwhile, Trump’s favorite TV network celebrated the price hike on Monday, saying on live air that rising consumer prices would be worth the cost if it successfully pushed immigrants out of the country.

“Ultimately, would you pay an extra quarter on a cup of coffee to send those people back?” *Fox & Friends* co-host Steve Doocy [asked](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fox-friends-colombia-trump-tariffs-b2687067.html), to which Brian Kilmeade replied: “Yes!”

The co-hosts’ solution? Buy cheaper coffee options at the grocery store.

“You just go Taster’s Choice. It’s instant. You put it in, and you stir it,” Kilmeade said.

Long story short, my friend wants to go to law school but has no experience. He asked if he could be my power of attorney to get some experience and I agreed because I wanted to help him out. But I’m not happy with what he’s doing and I can’t figure out how to make him stop.

When we were out for drinks with friends one time, he saw the debit card that I was using and said it was a bad bank. Next thing I know, I’m trying to use the card and it’s not working. Turns out he pulled all my money out, closed the account and opened a new one with a different bank plus a credit card with the bank. When he gave me the new cards I explained that I liked the old bank because they have branches in my home state I can use when I go home for summer from school. The new bank doesn’t. I also really don’t believe in credit cards and never wanted one (I have enough student loan debt anyway). But he said this bank was better and credit cards make more sense and he was doing me a favor. 

He also requested all my medical records from the student health center and let it slip in front of friends that I’m taking an antidepressant. A girl I like in our group doesn’t believe in them and now she’s not really talking to me anymore. 

I’ve brought up to him that I’m kind of not happy with this arrangement but he said he needs the poa for a few more months to show his law school applications that he has relevant experience, especially if her can’t get a legal job this summer between our junior and senior years. 

I’m having car trouble and he keeps trying to involve himself in the repair process and bully the mechanic and it makes me super uncomfortable but I don’t want to hurt his chances at law school. 

I’m in California.

Their mindset approach is backwards and needs to change. Suggestions to Improve PvP & Wilderness",">Jesus this post blew up faster than expected. Thank you everyone who helped contribute to the discussion.

>EDIT #1: **""Just learn PvP and get gud"" ""You sound like someone who doesn't PvP"" ""I'm not reading all that (proceeds to give arguments already discussed in post)"" ""Just do the survey""**

>First of all, I apologize that the post if insanely lengthy. I had to be thorough though in case a Jmod sees this (which seems very likely at this point). For those saying I should play PvP, I do, I already mentioned I enjoy playing PvP minigames just not Wildy PvP. The core reason for this is because in Minigames I'm actually geared and expecting to PvP whereas when PvMing in Wildy I am not. For those not wanting to read the post, that's understandable, but  likewise you should expect people to not take your comment too seriously if you end up arguing something already discussed in the post. For those saying I should do the survey, I'm convinced you didn't read the post since pics of questions from the survey were literally discussed in the post.

>**""Just freeze them back and escape""**  
The fact this has to be a main counterpoint is exactly part of the problem. Freezes are essentially treated as the main answer to all PvP interactions in the Wildy, and that shouldn't be the case. It should be a back-and-forth fight between 2 players. Many pkers have a mindset of just expecting others players to be ""free loot"" once they land a freeze and that completely goes against the spirit of PvP. There's a reason Pkers are called ""PKers"" instead of ""PvPers"", and it's because they're just looking for easy loot not an actual fight. The reason I suggested only a reduction in root timers and not a complete removal is simply because Bounty Hunter already has that, and also I recognize roots are a core part of the wilderness and part of skill expression so it wouldn't be fair to remove them. At least with that timer reduction, you still maintain that skill expression while reducing one of the biggest pain points for most players. If we need to reduce loot received from PvM in lower level Wildy to compensate for how much easier it is to escape and better encourage deep Wildy activity, I would be ok with that sentiment.

>**""But PKers are skulled and carry all the risk""**  
Except they don't. It's only a risk if they die while skulled, however many pkers (not pvpers) are just trying to get free loot and not wanting an actual fight. The moment you put up an actual fight for most of these types of players, they run for the hills at a moments notice scott free. PvP in Wildy is supposed to be risky for ALL players in Wildy, killing another player is SUPPOSED to be difficult and not just be free kills. Part of our responsibility as a community to to help change this mindset.

>**""Ironmen are isolated and aren't incentivized to fight in Wildy/PvP""**  
A few commenters made some suggestions I think are great solutions for this. 1) Let the GE value of your loot be taken from your death's coffer or bank instead of your automatically giving your gear/loot to the pker. Not only would this be good for irons, but I can see this working for mains too. PKers still get their loot, while players have a buffer to retain their stuff. In addition to this, if you don't have the cash available to give to the pker for this, THEN your loot/gear should be dropped to the pker. 2) As an Iron, let loot received from PvP go towards future bonds on the account. This way Irons have a reason to engage in PvP while not inherently being broken or abuseable for RWT.

>EDIT #2: **""Teleblock should block both the target and the caster""**  
I support this idea. Goes along with how PvP is supposed to be dangerous for both parties involved and not just the target.

>**""Over the years damage has been power crept while ability to tank has gone down""**  
Agreed 100%. This is also part of why players ability to survive in PvP (not skulled) needs to be buffed. Against experienced PvPers it's not even worth TRYING to fight back in it's current state as many people have commented.

Part of the problem I see with Jagex and the mods who typically try to work with PvP/Wilderness content is that they're looking at it through the wrong lens, arguably a PvPer's lens rather than a non-PvPer's one. It seems as if they're approaching the whole thing, time and time again, with the question ""How can we attract people to do the Wilderness?"" (which already assumes people engage in PvP/Wildy in the first place) rather than ""What's stopping players from engaging in PvP/Wilderness?"". The former is what ends up with Jagex continuously adding more rewards/loot to the Wildy thinking that's what will draw people in - which instead only keeps those ALREADY comfortable doing Wilderness/PvP content around for more - rather than going with the latter question which would result in REMOVING/CHANGING aspects of the Wildy/PvP that most players DON'T appreciate to help encourage the non-PvP content that they DO appreciate. The reason I bring this up is because I believe most people DO enjoy the idea of PvP, which is evident by how popular PvP content creators are and how packed PvP minigames can be, but don't engage in the Wildy because of how awful it feels to do so because of certain mechanics. Why? I believe most people WANT to engage in PvP/Wilderness, but *feel discouraged to do so for key reasons*:

**1. The death system, Stuns/Freezes & Loot Piñatas**

**2. Inconsistent differences between PvP and rest of the game.**

Let's dissect these one at a time, and consider possible solutions.

>**1. The death system, Stuns/Freezes & Loot Piñatas**

Most players view Wilderness PvP as just being a Loot Piñatas. Why though? What causes this sentiment?  
I think it boils down to 2 key factors:

* Stuns & Freezes
* The Gear disparity between PKers and PvMers.

Stuns and Freezes stops targets from escaping, but equally important, can stop them from fighting back **AT ALL** and allow PKers to attack **FOR FREE** at range. Ice Barrage currently traps players in place for about 19 seconds, and entangle for 14 seconds. THAT'S INSANE. In the latest Survey, Jagex asks a question regarding outside games that engage in PvP:

https://preview.redd.it/c7oxdifz67zd1.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=2edf4e1caf1e7525fceb7be2be4275e141ec66fb

For me personally I play a LOT of competitive PvP games. Hero shooters like Overwatch & Apex, MOBA's like SMITE & Pokemon Unite, TCG's like Magic The Gathering & Yugioh, yet OSRS is the only game I play where I rarely touch PvP in the Wilderness (I do casually enjoy the PvP Minigames though).

In ANY PvP game I've played, Stunning or stopping a player from attacking for any length of time is good value. To compare to fast paced games like Hero Shooters or MOBA's, any stuns that last 1-3 seconds is considered pretty good. Anything longer than that is typically INSANE and usually results in death. Bring it back to OSRS, and when you look at how Ice Barrage lasts for 19 WHOLE SECONDS or Entangle for 14 seconds, you're practically dead in most scenarios unless you're prepared for that type of encounter (AKA you're planning to fight back).

This is especially true if the PvMer is doing content that is Melee dominant, especially since none of the Wildy Bosses require any gear switches. If you wanted to fight back, you probably can't anyways since the content you came for didn't require any gear to attack at range to fight back with. Add on top that, the average PvMer is only bringing their 3 best items and rest is welfare gear solely for the content they came for and so they don't lose anything worth any type of significant time/money investment, whereas the PKer is bringing entire loadouts specifically for the PK interaction. So you essentially have 1 person with gear NOT intended for PvP while the other does.

Here's a personal example of PvM gear I bring to Vet'ion VS a PKer setup needed to reliably kill me (I'm a Max Main):

* My Minimal Risk Vet'ion Setup

https://preview.redd.it/qdh4qrhpc7zd1.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e9b5b18844c0f9139700e8328e0536ef229bb4

https://preview.redd.it/po65aymsc7zd1.png?width=229&format=png&auto=webp&s=32c57facbf8669c3c8a4320ed709948a9f6e694b

* A PKer's Setup (Taken from [OSRS Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Main_account#Elite))

https://preview.redd.it/t51bqehqb7zd1.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=8031d71348cd51eae567f32713dad48e0a1b5758

https://preview.redd.it/64mk1mbrb7zd1.png?width=197&format=png&auto=webp&s=040530891cb89629e0454cb07a980a4469fe3534

Looking at the 2 loadouts, you can see the clear discrepancy in gear for a PvP interaction. Gear #1 has 418 healing of food, whereas Gear #2 has 642 healing. Gear #1 ONLY has Melee and no burst damage. Gear #2 has Hybrid setup, better stats overall for all styles, Weapons to inflict Venom, has Freezes, and a Spec Weapon for Burst damage to secure the PK. In the event that I'm caught in a Freeze/Entangle, I'm basically dead.

**What can we do about this? Are there any simple solutions to address this? I think so.**

* **For Stuns & Freezes**, the simple answer is to simply reduce the amount of time you're frozen when in PvP.  It's simply not fun to interact with for most players, and there's a reason why it's not even useable in Bounty Hunter. If players didn't have to worry about Freezes as much, players may be more open to bringing other types of gear that doesn't rely on tanking Freezes. I propose reducing Ice Barrage from 19sec to 10sec (7sec if Protect from Magic is on), and reducing Entangle from 14sec to 7sec (5sec if Protect from Magic is on). This would still let you to get a couple of ""free"" hits in, but doesn't just guarantee you the win if it lands. Yes, this would dramatically change how NH (No Honour) PvP is done, but would drastically improve what the core spirit of PvP is supposed to be in most players eyes: a back-and-forth fight between 2 players. Reducing the timer on Freezes would increase the likelihood and duration of that back-and-forth to occur. Right now, Freezes just causes players to act as Deer in Headlights and get hit for free, hence the term ""Loot Piñatas"". In PvP, the back-and-forth struggle is what makes PvP fun and engaging (even when at a disadvantage), not the abuse of in-game mechanics by freezes.
* **For Gear**, Increasing the Minimum Items kept on death (if not skulled) from 3 to 5 would dramatically boost the likelihood of players bringing at least 1 or 2 items suited for fighting back in PvP. This would allow players to choose to either bring more gear suited for the content they're at, or bring a couple of switches for a PvP encounter. Overall, this essentially largely removes one of the main components players hate: losing gear that they invested time/money in to obtain. But won't this reduce the loot PKers obtain from players? A little but not much realistically. But given how dead the Wilderness is, the current model is CLEARLY not working and needs an adjustment/updating. On paper, reducing risk in equipped gear would let players be more open to venturing into the Wildy more often and more importantly, KEEP COMING BACK. You would still obtain any loot that they obtained in the Wilderness, so it's not the end of the world. Besides, are you REALLY gonna be mad over losing 10k in loot from allowing 2 extra safe items on death when they're just gonna wear welfare gear anyways? If allowing players to bring more safe gear encourages them to venture into the wilderness more often, and more importantly, helps gap the difference in gear between PKers and PvMers, I think the answer is self explanatory.

Here's an Example of what allowing 5 Safe Items on Death vs 3 Items could introduce. For this example, we're gonna continue with the Vetion example introduced above:

* **3 Items on Death (Ursine Chainmace, Avernic Defender & Ferocious Gloves) | Risk: 223k w/o Loot**

https://preview.redd.it/006wgoy7m7zd1.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=1efde141fce868ef258c856f870508ddc65b16a6

As you can see, the Risk still remains about the same for the PvMer, but drastically allows more of a fighting chance against PKers and allows for that Back-and-Forth to occur more naturally in the Wildy. They get to choose to either go all in and actually use the PvM gear they spent so long to obtain, or bring some switches to fight back in PvP, all while keeping the risk the same as it is now. The point is that only having 3 Items kept on Death is too limiting for non-PvPers to bring enough gear for both PvM AND PvP. Expanding it to 5 Items on Death would allow that. This didn't include the use of the Protect Item prayer of course, but I believe that shouldn't change much from what's already shown above and if anything further encourages people to bring more gear into the wildy (as it currently does) and allow them a better fighting chance against PKers.

The only point of concern would be how allowing 5 Items kept on Death would interact with the rest of the game outside of the Wildy, and here's my take: I primarily think it'll only affect the early to mid-game players the most, and barely (or not at all) affect end/late-game players. This is mainly due to late game players already bringing in tons of gear for end-game content, so their death fee is likely to stay relatively the same. For other players, even though their death fees may likely be lower, I think this isn't necessarily a bad thing since it encourages more earlier players to engage in PvM and be OK with making more mistakes and learning PvM overall (which is the goal, isn't it?). Their death fees probably aren't a lot in the first place, on top of they don't have access to the best money makers yet anyways to afford expensive death fees, so lowering their death fees should encourage them to engage in and learn more dangerous content.

>**2. Inconsistent differences between PvP and rest of the game.**

Currently, there are too many differences in mechanics on how certain gear operate within and outside of PvP. This is further exasperated by the fact that in many situations, whenever a change occurs to gear for PvP there's little to no explanation as to why it's been changed solely for PvP and not the entire game.

So with that said, I definitely feel some type of way when I see questions like this in the survey:

https://preview.redd.it/cgh6x7mtq8zd1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd0b70e6d9c2d28f4bb5d0b44e762f57ca1b0ab1

Well no wonder no one knows WHY certain items work differently in PvP vs the rest of the game - they literally never tell us why sometimes! In some scenarios, like with the Abyssal Dagger, they tell us one thing (promising to include it's power in a future QoL poll, alluding that a future change would allow it to work the same way throughout the entire game) and instead shoehorned it as a PvP reward instead.

With that said, I do think many items should receive a revaluation on why they work differently and whether or not they should continue to do so. Many items I feel, such as Raid items, SHOULD be powerful given how rare or challenging they are to acquire. An example would be [Justiciar Armor](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Justiciar_armour). It's literally THE defacto tank armor, it's SUPPOSED to reduce damage. Why are it's passive effects negated in PvP??

https://preview.redd.it/ny3gvi4yu8zd1.png?width=1214&format=png&auto=webp&s=8519bfe8077977e2e7dc934c7f27e45dfea0dd84

But yet for some reason the [Elysian Spirit Shield](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Elysian_spirit_shield) is allowed to keep it's passive in PvP despite being similar to Justiciar's??

https://preview.redd.it/ps85k94ev8zd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=b464b9676d46a538901244d0ce7e63c360c2a166

Across the board, in my opinion, items should work the same across the game for both PvP and otherwise unless there's a VERY good reason for them not to, and should be consulted with the community first before making any changes to avoid knee-jerk reactions. Stats I believe are acceptable parameters to make changes to for gear, since there's enough feedback loops (seeing the animation/stats in-game) to make it obvious, but nitpicking at different Passive effects/mechanics for PvP is not.

Let's talk UI during PvP briefly. For what possible reason can someone explain to me in a way that makes logical sense, does being in PvP warrant staff's not remembering your autocast spell when switching weapons, when it's been that way in the rest of the game??

https://preview.redd.it/3gwojz1e29zd1.png?width=1205&format=png&auto=webp&s=507531ea9a3db308f0a6b8425013fb599b40ab73

* **Staff can't autocast spells by default:** Ok makes sense.
* **You ran out of runes to autocast so it's canceled:** Ok makes sense.
* **You're fighting someone:** Huh?!?! Isn't part of autocast TO fight with it?

Continuing with the UI topic, there's absolutely no reason why in 2024 and with the introduction of resizable spell icons should we be forced to see every spell in the spellbook while in PvP. Especially when these days, everyone uses the icon filter built into the game literally everywhere else (that's the worst part, it's already in the game. It's not even a Runelite exclusive plugin!).  ""But it messes with PvPers muscle memory"" Bro you can literally disable the icon resizes so it doesnt mess with muscle memory, and for everyone else they can use the normal resized ones. Stop being a baby.

Summary

* Considerably Reduce Freeze/Stun timers
* Increase Items Kept on Death limit (not skulled)
* Do a better job explaining why Jagex would like to make certain mechanics/gear PvP exclusive and consult with community first before Implementing. Not just PvPers.
* Revaluate current gear differences and aim to make them Universal effects
* Update UI within PvP so it matches the rest of the game

That's it for my TED Talk. Please be respectful in the comments, and I look forward to everyone's thoughts on the matter. I'll update the post if anyone brings up notable points/info.",3838,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1gkuq3v/jagex_needs_to_start_asking_whats_stopping/,1730885658.0,2007scape,"Jagex needs to start asking ""What's stopping players from engaging in the Wilderness?"" instead of ""How can we draw players to the Wilderness?"" Their mindset approach is backwards and needs to change. Suggestions to Improve PvP & Wilderness >Jesus this post blew up faster than expected. Thank you everyone who helped contribute to the discussion.

>EDIT #1: **""Just learn PvP and get gud"" ""You sound like someone who doesn't PvP"" ""I'm not reading all that (proceeds to give arguments already discussed in post)"" ""Just do the survey""**

>First of all, I apologize that the post if insanely lengthy. I had to be thorough though in case a Jmod sees this (which seems very likely at this point). For those saying I should play PvP, I do, I already mentioned I enjoy playing PvP minigames just not Wildy PvP. The core reason for this is because in Minigames I'm actually geared and expecting to PvP whereas when PvMing in Wildy I am not. For those not wanting to read the post, that's understandable, but  likewise you should expect people to not take your comment too seriously if you end up arguing something already discussed in the post. For those saying I should do the survey, I'm convinced you didn't read the post since pics of questions from the survey were literally discussed in the post.

>**""Just freeze them back and escape""**  
The fact this has to be a main counterpoint is exactly part of the problem. Freezes are essentially treated as the main answer to all PvP interactions in the Wildy, and that shouldn't be the case. It should be a back-and-forth fight between 2 players. Many pkers have a mindset of just expecting others players to be ""free loot"" once they land a freeze and that completely goes against the spirit of PvP. There's a reason Pkers are called ""PKers"" instead of ""PvPers"", and it's because they're just looking for easy loot not an actual fight. The reason I suggested only a reduction in root timers and not a complete removal is simply because Bounty Hunter already has that, and also I recognize roots are a core part of the wilderness and part of skill expression so it wouldn't be fair to remove them. At least with that timer reduction, you still maintain that skill expression while reducing one of the biggest pain points for most players. If we need to reduce loot received from PvM in lower level Wildy to compensate for how much easier it is to escape and better encourage deep Wildy activity, I would be ok with that sentiment.

>**""But PKers are skulled and carry all the risk""**  
Except they don't. It's only a risk if they die while skulled, however many pkers (not pvpers) are just trying to get free loot and not wanting an actual fight. The moment you put up an actual fight for most of these types of players, they run for the hills at a moments notice scott free. PvP in Wildy is supposed to be risky for ALL players in Wildy, killing another player is SUPPOSED to be difficult and not just be free kills. Part of our responsibility as a community to to help change this mindset.

>**""Ironmen are isolated and aren't incentivized to fight in Wildy/PvP""**  
A few commenters made some suggestions I think are great solutions for this. 1) Let the GE value of your loot be taken from your death's coffer or bank instead of your automatically giving your gear/loot to the pker. Not only would this be good for irons, but I can see this working for mains too. PKers still get their loot, while players have a buffer to retain their stuff. In addition to this, if you don't have the cash available to give to the pker for this, THEN your loot/gear should be dropped to the pker. 2) As an Iron, let loot received from PvP go towards future bonds on the account. This way Irons have a reason to engage in PvP while not inherently being broken or abuseable for RWT.

>EDIT #2: **""Teleblock should block both the target and the caster""**  
I support this idea. Goes along with how PvP is supposed to be dangerous for both parties involved and not just the target.

>**""Over the years damage has been power crept while ability to tank has gone down""**  
Agreed 100%. This is also part of why players ability to survive in PvP (not skulled) needs to be buffed. Against experienced PvPers it's not even worth TRYING to fight back in it's current state as many people have commented.

Part of the problem I see with Jagex and the mods who typically try to work with PvP/Wilderness content is that they're looking at it through the wrong lens, arguably a PvPer's lens rather than a non-PvPer's one. It seems as if they're approaching the whole thing, time and time again, with the question ""How can we attract people to do the Wilderness?"" (which already assumes people engage in PvP/Wildy in the first place) rather than ""What's stopping players from engaging in PvP/Wilderness?"". The former is what ends up with Jagex continuously adding more rewards/loot to the Wildy thinking that's what will draw people in - which instead only keeps those ALREADY comfortable doing Wilderness/PvP content around for more - rather than going with the latter question which would result in REMOVING/CHANGING aspects of the Wildy/PvP that most players DON'T appreciate to help encourage the non-PvP content that they DO appreciate. The reason I bring this up is because I believe most people DO enjoy the idea of PvP, which is evident by how popular PvP content creators are and how packed PvP minigames can be, but don't engage in the Wildy because of how awful it feels to do so because of certain mechanics. Why? I believe most people WANT to engage in PvP/Wilderness, but *feel discouraged to do so for key reasons*:

**1. The death system, Stuns/Freezes & Loot Piñatas**

**2. Inconsistent differences between PvP and rest of the game.**

Let's dissect these one at a time, and consider possible solutions.

>**1. The death system, Stuns/Freezes & Loot Piñatas**

Most players view Wilderness PvP as just being a Loot Piñatas. Why though? What causes this sentiment?  
I think it boils down to 2 key factors:

* Stuns & Freezes
* The Gear disparity between PKers and PvMers.

Stuns and Freezes stops targets from escaping, but equally important, can stop them from fighting back **AT ALL** and allow PKers to attack **FOR FREE** at range. Ice Barrage currently traps players in place for about 19 seconds, and entangle for 14 seconds. THAT'S INSANE. In the latest Survey, Jagex asks a question regarding outside games that engage in PvP:

https://preview.redd.it/c7oxdifz67zd1.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=2edf4e1caf1e7525fceb7be2be4275e141ec66fb

For me personally I play a LOT of competitive PvP games. Hero shooters like Overwatch & Apex, MOBA's like SMITE & Pokemon Unite, TCG's like Magic The Gathering & Yugioh, yet OSRS is the only game I play where I rarely touch PvP in the Wilderness (I do casually enjoy the PvP Minigames though).

In ANY PvP game I've played, Stunning or stopping a player from attacking for any length of time is good value. To compare to fast paced games like Hero Shooters or MOBA's, any stuns that last 1-3 seconds is considered pretty good. Anything longer than that is typically INSANE and usually results in death. Bring it back to OSRS, and when you look at how Ice Barrage lasts for 19 WHOLE SECONDS or Entangle for 14 seconds, you're practically dead in most scenarios unless you're prepared for that type of encounter (AKA you're planning to fight back).

This is especially true if the PvMer is doing content that is Melee dominant, especially since none of the Wildy Bosses require any gear switches. If you wanted to fight back, you probably can't anyways since the content you came for didn't require any gear to attack at range to fight back with. Add on top that, the average PvMer is only bringing their 3 best items and rest is welfare gear solely for the content they came for and so they don't lose anything worth any type of significant time/money investment, whereas the PKer is bringing entire loadouts specifically for the PK interaction. So you essentially have 1 person with gear NOT intended for PvP while the other does.

Here's a personal example of PvM gear I bring to Vet'ion VS a PKer setup needed to reliably kill me (I'm a Max Main):

* My Minimal Risk Vet'ion Setup

https://preview.redd.it/qdh4qrhpc7zd1.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e9b5b18844c0f9139700e8328e0536ef229bb4

* A PKer's Setup (Taken from [OSRS Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Main_account#Elite))

https://preview.redd.it/t51bqehqb7zd1.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=8031d71348cd51eae567f32713dad48e0a1b5758

https://preview.redd.it/64mk1mbrb7zd1.png?width=197&format=png&auto=webp&s=040530891cb89629e0454cb07a980a4469fe3534

Looking at the 2 loadouts, you can see the clear discrepancy in gear for a PvP interaction. Gear #1 has 418 healing of food, whereas Gear #2 has 642 healing. Gear #1 ONLY has Melee and no burst damage. Gear #2 has Hybrid setup, better stats overall for all styles, Weapons to inflict Venom, has Freezes, and a Spec Weapon for Burst damage to secure the PK. In the event that I'm caught in a Freeze/Entangle, I'm basically dead.

**What can we do about this? Are there any simple solutions to address this? I think so.**

* **For Stuns & Freezes**, the simple answer is to simply reduce the amount of time you're frozen when in PvP.  It's simply not fun to interact with for most players, and there's a reason why it's not even useable in Bounty Hunter. If players didn't have to worry about Freezes as much, players may be more open to bringing other types of gear that doesn't rely on tanking Freezes. I propose reducing Ice Barrage from 19sec to 10sec (7sec if Protect from Magic is on), and reducing Entangle from 14sec to 7sec (5sec if Protect from Magic is on). This would still let you to get a couple of ""free"" hits in, but doesn't just guarantee you the win if it lands. Yes, this would dramatically change how NH (No Honour) PvP is done, but would drastically improve what the core spirit of PvP is supposed to be in most players eyes: a back-and-forth fight between 2 players. Reducing the timer on Freezes would increase the likelihood and duration of that back-and-forth to occur. Right now, Freezes just causes players to act as Deer in Headlights and get hit for free, hence the term ""Loot Piñatas"". In PvP, the back-and-forth struggle is what makes PvP fun and engaging (even when at a disadvantage), not the abuse of in-game mechanics by freezes.
* **For Gear**, Increasing the Minimum Items kept on death (if not skulled) from 3 to 5 would dramatically boost the likelihood of players bringing at least 1 or 2 items suited for fighting back in PvP. This would allow players to choose to either bring more gear suited for the content they're at, or bring a couple of switches for a PvP encounter. Overall, this essentially largely removes one of the main components players hate: losing gear that they invested time/money in to obtain. But won't this reduce the loot PKers obtain from players? A little but not much realistically. But given how dead the Wilderness is, the current model is CLEARLY not working and needs an adjustment/updating. On paper, reducing risk in equipped gear would let players be more open to venturing into the Wildy more often and more importantly, KEEP COMING BACK. You would still obtain any loot that they obtained in the Wilderness, so it's not the end of the world. Besides, are you REALLY gonna be mad over losing 10k in loot from allowing 2 extra safe items on death when they're just gonna wear welfare gear anyways? If allowing players to bring more safe gear encourages them to venture into the wilderness more often, and more importantly, helps gap the difference in gear between PKers and PvMers, I think the answer is self explanatory.

Here's an Example of what allowing 5 Safe Items on Death vs 3 Items could introduce. For this example, we're gonna continue with the Vetion example introduced above:

* **3 Items on Death (Ursine Chainmace, Avernic Defender & Ferocious Gloves) | Risk: 223k w/o Loot**

https://preview.redd.it/006wgoy7m7zd1.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=1efde141fce868ef258c856f870508ddc65b16a6

* **5 Items on Death Option #2 for Anti-PK (Ursine Chainmace, Avernic Defender, Ferocious Gloves, Zaryte Crossbow & Dragonfire Shield) | Risk: 220k w/o Loot**

https://preview.redd.it/ccog6725o7zd1.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5096765a0b104f6bd8a281d7ee845362bc76a5b

As you can see, the Risk still remains about the same for the PvMer, but drastically allows more of a fighting chance against PKers and allows for that Back-and-Forth to occur more naturally in the Wildy. They get to choose to either go all in and actually use the PvM gear they spent so long to obtain, or bring some switches to fight back in PvP, all while keeping the risk the same as it is now. The point is that only having 3 Items kept on Death is too limiting for non-PvPers to bring enough gear for both PvM AND PvP. Expanding it to 5 Items on Death would allow that. This didn't include the use of the Protect Item prayer of course, but I believe that shouldn't change much from what's already shown above and if anything further encourages people to bring more gear into the wildy (as it currently does) and allow them a better fighting chance against PKers.

The only point of concern would be how allowing 5 Items kept on Death would interact with the rest of the game outside of the Wildy, and here's my take: I primarily think it'll only affect the early to mid-game players the most, and barely (or not at all) affect end/late-game players. This is mainly due to late game players already bringing in tons of gear for end-game content, so their death fee is likely to stay relatively the same. For other players, even though their death fees may likely be lower, I think this isn't necessarily a bad thing since it encourages more earlier players to engage in PvM and be OK with making more mistakes and learning PvM overall (which is the goal, isn't it?). Their death fees probably aren't a lot in the first place, on top of they don't have access to the best money makers yet anyways to afford expensive death fees, so lowering their death fees should encourage them to engage in and learn more dangerous content.

>**2. Inconsistent differences between PvP and rest of the game.**

Currently, there are too many differences in mechanics on how certain gear operate within and outside of PvP. This is further exasperated by the fact that in many situations, whenever a change occurs to gear for PvP there's little to no explanation as to why it's been changed solely for PvP and not the entire game.

Across the board, in my opinion, items should work the same across the game for both PvP and otherwise unless there's a VERY good reason for them not to, and should be consulted with the community first before making any changes to avoid knee-jerk reactions. Stats I believe are acceptable parameters to make changes to for gear, since there's enough feedback loops (seeing the animation/stats in-game) to make it obvious, but nitpicking at different Passive effects/mechanics for PvP is not.

Continuing with the UI topic, there's absolutely no reason why in 2024 and with the introduction of resizable spell icons should we be forced to see every spell in the spellbook while in PvP.

Banks to be handed new powers to block large payments for up to four days,,159,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/banking/banks-handed-new-power-block-large-payments-four-days/,1725364604.0,unitedkingdom,Banks to be handed new powers to block large payments for up to four days 
A message appeared on every screen in the world: HIDE.,"I stared with confusion at my phone. The rest of the gang were all-in on this Monopoly game.

“I swear to God, if you get Free Parking I will literally kill your stupid face,” said Evelyn.

Ravi rolled the dice in his hands. “*Come on,* sweet baby Jesus. I just need a *four.*” He dropped them onto the board. “Fuck!” he said, probably biffing it like always.

I tried to make sense of it. Just a word on my screen—black text on an all white background, a rather classical-looking font: 

**“HIDE”**

I tapped, rather impatiently, on the expensive black rectangle. The text wouldn’t disappear. 

“*AJ*,” Evelyn called, like a teacher busting a student. “You’re fucking addicted. Play board games like a normal human adult.”

“Yeah, I—sorry.” A few more desperate fingerpecks at the screen, then I turned to holding the power button down for an extended period. With my free hand, I grabbed the dice, rolled a three, landed on *B & O Railroad.* After two seconds of thought—“Nah, fuck railroads,” I said.

Of course, we weren’t animals. If someone didn’t want to buy a property, that was fine. No auctions or any of that nonsense. *House rules.*

Back to the phone as Hiro, on my left, took the cubes and prepared to drag his sorry little shoe across *Go* to collect his two hundred dollars. A minute with the power button didn’t do anything—we were entering factory reset territory. I contemplated borrowing Ravi’s laptop to Google whatever the fuck this might have been. 

I felt the apartment rumble—albeit, just for a split second. As if we were on the edge of an earthquake. I tensed, briefly. 

The background noise from the TV—*No One Wants This* autoplaying on Netflix—disappeared, following the faint sound of the flicker of static. 

Ravi was the first to get up. “I don’t…” he said, talking slowly as if not to jinx it, “I don’t *think* that was an earthquake?” He examined the TV, confused at the outage. He checked the wires. “Shouldn’t be the breaker—I don’t have that much stuff plugged in, do I?” 

I grappled with the sad, likely *hacked* state of my phone—and that weird word staring me down.

“Damn, that’s fucking weird,” I heard Hiro say, half-laughing.

Head lifted. “What?” I asked to catch Hiro turning his phone to me. His home screen too had been replaced by black text atop white. “HIDE” 

Evelyn, as anti-technology as it comes, had properly clocked this reprieve as her time to quickly respond to long outstanding texts. “The fuck?” she said. “What… is this?” 

At my confused look—bordering on scowl, *resting scowl face*—she flipped her phone around to show me the damage. It was the same on hers. 

I grew a bit nervous. “Ravi, where’s your phone?” I asked him.

“I’m sure it’s somewhere,” he said, still tinkering with the TV. Likely not due to any of his troubleshooting, it flashed back to life, red power light at the base blinking steadily.

A simple message now appeared on the big screen. 

“Hide?” Ravi asked, grabbing the remote and pressing buttons to switch back to Netflix, but nothing was registering.

“Dude,” I said. He turned around. I showed him my phone—Hiro and Evelyn showed theirs.

“That’s…” he looked back at the TV, then at us again, “wait *how is that possible?”*

“Is that like an amber alert?” Hiro asked.

“I mean I guess but that’s a push notification, this is like, *completely overtaking the screen.*” Ravi’s brows furrowed. “On different hardware, too.”

“A hack?” I asked.

He shrugged. “That’s kind of a weird hack, no?” 

“Government experiment?” Hiro again.

A thought came over me.

I walked to the balcony, slid the door open, stepped out onto it. Eye of Sauron’d the city from Ravi’s fourteenth floor apartment. 

In the neighboring apartment towers, most of the units had blinds down, curtains closed. The few unshuttered however—*I felt like that guy from Rear Window*—contained strangers staring perplexed at their phones. At their computers. The sides of bolted-to-the-wall TVs, barely visible to me, displayed the same white background with text atop it. What I was seeing, everyone else was seeing.

The others joined me on the balcony. 

“Whatever it is, it’s at least hit this block,” I said. I looked down at the city streets—most of the people below caught in a similar holding pattern of standing frozen, heads fixed to their devices. 

“I guess we don’t have anything to call the cops with?” Hiro. 

“I’m sure they’re aware.” Me.

“Maybe wait it out until they fix it?” Ravi.

I nodded. And yet, I could tell Evelyn was a bit perturbed. Forcing magnetic thoughts to imbue her silence with weight. “Thoughts?” I asked her.

“I mean, should we do it?” she asked.

“Do what?” Ravi. 

“Hide.” Her again.

“Hide where?” Ravi again. 

“I don’t know,” she said.

“I mean, we’re already in my apartment. I’m sure that’s—good enough, right?” he said.

A pause.  

“Let’s not lose our heads,” Ravi continued. “This is nuts but it’s not—I mean it’s not like, *literally hide,* right?”

Hiro clicked his fingers. “What if it’s viral marketing? Like for a movie?” Hiro with the necessary but unintentional levity.

“*Hacking our phones so we can’t use them?* I don’t know if that’s in Lionsgate’s purview, man,” I said, then, head turned to Evelyn. “But *hide?*”

The flicker in her eyes more than meant that she’d sided with the lightbulb in her head. She returned to the inside, and got to exploring Ravi’s apartment carefully. 

“What are you doing?” Ravi asked, trailing. Hiro and I followed.

“I don’t care if I look stupid. It could be a warning. Maybe something is happening,” she said. 

“We’re in a box in a box, basically,” said Ravi. “We’re fine Ev.”

“But the fucking *thing,*” she motioned to the TV, then to her own phone, “says *hide.* Maybe it’s *that* literal.” She continued scouting, finally settling on the sliding closet in Ravi’s room—the best she could come up with in his 600 square foot quarters. “I’ll do here unless you think there’s better.”

“*Evelyn*,” Ravi stressed.

She shuffled in, past hung garments, scooching to the end to make space. “I’m gonna close the door soon, and if you’re all *really* my friends, you’ll join me.” 

Awkward silence until Hiro chimed first—

“I mean, guess it’s good to be safe right?” He went for it, second-guessed for a second, then committed to entering.

“You guys get the luxury of laughing at me forever if I’m dumb—win-win,” she called while Hiro wedged in beside her. A compelling argument, certainly.

Begrudgingly, I followed, tucking in next under Ravi’s dress clothes. There was still room for him inside his own closet.

“Fucking hell,” he caved, joining last, sliding the door closed to introduce darkness.

I went back to my phone. Still that classical font. Still that mandate.

“How long do we have to stay in here?” Ravi asked.

“Five minutes,” she said.

“Yeesh,” he tagged.

And then we sat in stillness for a while.

Distant *tick tick ticks* of the clock in the living room bringing down the blood pressure a tad. 

It all felt—silly. Kind of fun.

“Remember when we went camping at Sunlight Groves?” Hiro asked. 

“*Glamping,*” Ravi clarified.

“Ev thought she saw a bear.” Hiro laughed. “A bear and its cub.”

“It was dark, it fucking *looked like bears,*” she said, half-laughing herself. “I heard noises too.” 

“Bears at *Sunlight Groves,*” he said again. “Saddest patch of trees in America.” 

“Guys, shut up. We’re here so let’s commit to the bit. Before the *Conjuring* doll gets us,” said Ravi, surprisingly not bitterly.

We kept our traps zipped for another minute. 

Eyes at my phone again. “HIDE”—nonsensical, all of it really, but in a way that was starting to sit more and more uncomfortably for me. 

“What do you think it is?” Hiro whispered.

I shook my head. Evelyn with the light shrug. Ravi with a deep inhale before speaking. “I mean, *obviously sophisticated,*” he said, voice low. “Like it’s—yeah, it’s obviously *something*.”

I waved my phone. “My bank is on this and it’s bricked now basically? I’m fucked.”

“They’ll figure something out,” said Ravi.

Powerful knocks at his apartment door all of a sudden. Thundering.

“Hey!” a voice called, muffled through the walls. “Ravi, you there?”

Evelyn braced. *“Who is that?”*

“A skinwalker, obviously,” replied Ravi. “Kidding—my neighbor Monica.”  

Evelyn reached across me and Hiro to tug at Ravi’s sleeve. *“Are you positive?”*

“*Yes,* and I should probably get it.”

“You said five minutes,” she said.

“Yeah but I’m being a pretty trash neighbor right now,” he replied.

The knocking persisted. So did the words. *“I have this weird thing on my phone—Brad has it too. It says Hide? TV same thing, computer same thing, I don’t know how to reach anyone or what to do—*” the neighbor trailed on. 

Ravi blew air out of his nose. “Alright, this is stupid, I’m gonna—”

“No!” said Evelyn, but then all of a sudden—

He stopped. 

We all stopped. 

*I felt something*. Something very, very real—

No knocking anymore. Or at least, I couldn’t hear anything. Not the tick of the clock, nor the soft rustle of us against clothing. It was like the world was holding its breath. 

Like there was a *presence.* Right outside the closet. 

Then—the sting of static in my ear, before—

It passed. 

Whatever it was, the feeling dissipated, the sound returned, and I sneaked a glance at my phone—

The word HIDE was gone and replacing it was my home screen. 

The silence between the four of us was uncomfortable. 

“Did you feel that?” Evelyn finally whispered.

No one said anything. Ravi outstretched his arm yet again to slide the door open, but his hands were shaking. 

“You can do it,” I whispered. “I think we’re good.”

He steeled himself, looking very much like he was crossing some sort of internal threshold. He pulled the door aside, revealing his room exactly as we’d left it. 

We took it in. 

“I’m gonna answer Monica,” he said, with not a whole lot of vigor to his voice, getting up and creeping out of the room. The rest of us followed, stopping in the living room while he continued to the door.

I went to Twitter, searched ‘Hide’ and sorted by new. Evelyn, meanwhile, grabbed the remote from the stand and turned the TV—now “Hideless”–-on and maneuvered through the Roku channels.

“What are you looking for?” Hiro asked.

“Just like, a *live* channel, I guess.” she replied. “The news?” 

My scrolling wasn’t yielding anything of help or insight, though it was clear—via the confused posts from seemingly around the whole world—that the scope of whatever happened was global. 

My focus shifted to Ravi, who was standing on the welcome mat, eye pressed against the door’s peephole. He hadn’t moved in quite some time.

“Everything alright man?” I asked.

He didn’t reply. Just stood there, frozen.

I approached slowly. 

“She’s… she’s…” I heard him croak.

I reached him, patting him on the shoulders and urging him to detach from the door viewer. He finally did, leaning against the wall at first before slowly sliding to a seat on the floor.

I peered into the hallway through the hole.

Outside, his neighbor—the one knocking—

Looked like she’d been skewered. Decimated.

An explosion of blood in the hallway. 

“What…” I felt a buzz on my phone. I pulled it out.

**“AGAIN”**

Before I could even process, I heard Ravi and Evelyn react.

“There’s another one—”

“It says *again* now—”

I turned to see the foreboding word on the TV. “Fuck.”

“So we should hide again?” Hiro called.

Much like Ravi, I was shellshocked.

“AJ, what do you think we should do?” he repeated. 

“Evelyn,” I said, trying to force the words out of my mouth. “You had good instincts the first time—what—*what do you think*?”

“How much time do you think we have?” she asked.

*How much time passed between when I first saw the word HIDE and when we felt that presence in the closet?*

“It might’ve been ten minutes,” I heard Ravi mutter, almost lifeless. 

“I… don’t…” then Evelyn interrupted herself, “wait, what did you just see outside?”

She started approaching the door. I stopped her. “I don’t… think it’ll be good… for you to see it.”

“Are—are you serious?” she responded.

“*Yes,*” I said, immediately realizing that lying might have been smarter.

“We can’t assume we have the same amount of time,” Ravi added. 

I went with my pitch. “Do we try the same spot?” 

Hiro started pacing, thinking, tapping his foot. “It’s—if we think about it, it said “hide” and we hid. Now it’s saying “again” and *obviously* that means that—whatever happened, is gonna—happen again.” He gave us a look, as if he could see, in our drained expressions, what was waiting on the other side of the door.

“That’s… a great recap man,” I said.

“What I mean,” he said, struggling, “is that when you’d play, as a kid, if you kept picking the same spot over and over, eventually it’d catch up to you.” 

“Are we really trying to apply some sort of logic to this?” Ravi mumbled.

Evelyn fortified herself. “I think he’s right. It’s *nuts* and I can’t believe I’m saying this, but we need to operate on gut. And *gut* tells me—we pick better spots this time.”

“But *spots* makes it sound like we should split up?” I said, looking around, slowly realizing that the limited real estate we had to work with meant this suggestion made more sense than I would’ve liked. I turned to Ravi. “Where should we all go?” 

He shook his head, palmed his forehead a few times as if to slap himself back to reality. “We do…” he started, thinking, “Two under my bed,” he grimaced, letting neurons collide in his mind, “One of us in the utility closet, the other… laundry closet.” He got up and pointed—one of the closets was right behind me. Life in him again. “Now!”

My eyes flitted to Hiro and Evelyn, who ran into the bedroom. 

Ravi gave me a nod, before entering the laundry closet and awkwardly squeezing in with the washer and dryer, closing his door.

I entered the utility closet, and closed mine.

Rather—I tried to. The door wasn’t clicking shut.

*“Fuck,”* I said, “Ravi, the door, it’s not—” but then I fought the urge to say anything more. If time was up, I’d compromise my spot, hell, compromise his spot too if I kept talking. I tried a few more times to get it to close, then—

I committed, terrified out of my mind, to gripping the handle and holding the door shut. I tried to keep my shaking hand and quickening breath in check as—

The silence overtook again. *Complete* silence, and *then,* that presence—

I felt a light tug at the door. I kept my hold firm but didn’t try to overpower–-didn’t want to completely give it away—

And again, it stopped. 

The feeling disappeared. And I waited fifteen seconds before sneaking a look at my phone, to see that the “AGAIN” warning was gone.

I heard the sound of Ravi’s door swing open first. I followed with mine.

He was emotional. “I forgot that that door is fucked, I got scared man, and I was—”

“You’re all good—it’s alright man, I know—”

“I even heard you call for me, and I didn’t, I—I panicked and I thought it’d—”

“We’re alive man, it’s alright, we’re—” and immediately I remembered it wasn’t just *us*. “*Evelyn and Hiro.*”

“Right,” he said. We rushed to his bedroom.

Nothing—at first. The two hadn’t emerged yet. For a moment, the horrifying thought that we’d be pulling their corpses out from under the bed rushed past me.

“Guys,” I said, “Coast is clear. Quick—”

Silence. For quite some time, before they finally shuffled out in one piece, alive.

As they shifted from crawl to bend to standing, I wanted to hold them. Hold everyone. For just a second, I felt a newfound appreciation for life and their faces and personalities.

Another buzz on my phone. I took a look: 

**“BREAK TIME”**

I let out a sigh of relief and showed the message to the others. 

“I guess that’s good,” Evelyn said. “A second to catch our breaths, after this fucking *craziness.*”

“But then what?” Ravi asked. “Is this just gonna *continue?*”

We walked into the living room together, nervously.

“We haven’t even gotten a single second to wrap our heads around this,” Evelyn again. 

Something in me didn’t seem right. 

I didn’t feel good. 

“Hey, Ev, how’d you know that we should’ve stayed in the closet for five minutes?” Hiro asked, somewhat pointedly.

I clocked minor annoyance in her face at the question. “I didn’t *know* anything—it was a guess. But I mean, yeah, you guys were fucking lucky I was here and pushed for it, because *fuck* were you all being stubborn.” 

Hiro wore a strange expression as he looked at her. “Alright.”

“Sounds like you want to say something more,” she said.

“Why would I? What makes you think I’d—”

Ravi interrupted Hiro by stepping between the two of them. “*Holy hell,* keep your heads on people,” but as he said it, and maybe it was just an aberration in my mind, but I couldn’t help but feel something significant stir within me, something *really* inflame, as if even though his face was straight he was concealing some sort of inner smile at what was happening.

“Hiro, I think you’re focusing your skepticism in the wrong direction,” I said.

Ravi’s expression turned irritated, which all but confirmed it for me. 

“I don’t know if you want to be mad at the person that saved us the first time,” I said, trying to make a point by motioning to Evelyn, but as I looked at her, something felt wrong there too. I contained it. “Or rather, the person who wanted to *open the closet door*.”

And then something even more obvious hit me.

“Wait, Ravi, *you tried to kill me*.”

And all of a sudden, I was glaring at him, my temper rising by metric tons every second as if it was all starting to make sense. Evelyn and Hiro joined me.

Ravi looked incredulous. “I already admitted that I fucked up with the door—*I confessed to you!* Why are you trying to make things worse? I was trying to calm them down—” then, noticing us approach him, he backed towards the kitchen cabinets. He pointed at me. “You were on your phone when this first happened,” he said, as if he were having his own revelation. “You were waiting—waiting for it to start—”

“That’s an *insane* fucking misdirect,” I said, positive that I couldn’t trust him. But as my eyes turned to Evelyn and Hiro, I realized I couldn’t trust them either, couldn’t trust anyone. 

*Still,* Ravi absolutely needed to be the first to go, the first to be disposed of. 

He grabbed a knife from the cupboard and held it out at us.

And only the smallest thought in the back of my mind was telling me that we were being toyed with—that it was so incredibly obvious that whatever this was, it had a handle on us, but unfortunately that understanding was academic for me at best, as I kept finding string after string of thoughts and emotions connecting, everything adding up, the logic *sound*, my emotions *inflamed*—

“Break time,” Evelyn said. “It’s breaking us.”

*Of course she would know that though, if she were in on it.*

We all looked at her. I watched for sudden movements from any of these traitors—these bastards. Even a millimeter shift wouldn’t get past me.

“It’s overriding us, it’s flooding us with anger that isn’t ours, and *real as it feels*—”

She faced her phone at us, beckoning us to read it clearly:

**“BREAK TIME”**

“We can’t fall to it.”

And that small grounded part of me took over, even though I was sure with everything in my soul that she, Ravi, and Hiro were the source of everything that was happening. 

Ravi’s grip on the knife tightened as he and the rest of us remained in the bizarre equilibrium of our four-way stand off. 

*It’s all of you,* I thought to myself, before I felt a lightness overtake me. 

Like an insatiable hunger fading, or extreme fear dissipating when you realize that noise in the other room wasn’t a person but rather something knocking over, my feelings of unrest and paranoia were gone. My phone screen, once again, returned to its default background.

It was hard to describe how I felt now. *Lucidity. Shame.* I looked at Ravi sadly. His head hung low as he put the knife back in its place.

Hiro turned to Evelyn first. “I’m sorry,” he said. Then to Ravi. “Sorry.”

“Sorry guys,” Ravi.

“I’m sorry.” Me.

“You’re welcome, assholes.” Evelyn. *We deserved that.*

“That was fucking—insane,” Ravi said.

“Like a fucked up rollercoaster ride,” said Evelyn.

“I didn’t—that, *that wasn’t totally me*,” Hiro said. “Like, *something was in me*, and it was—”

“It’s okay man.” I was getting tired of saying it, and certainly I out of everyone didn’t deserve to impart forgiveness anyway after where my own head was at only thirty seconds ago. 

“We need to like, write something down—like *we are susceptible. Don’t forget—”* started Ravi.

“We just need to remember to keep your heads on,” I interrupted, “Remember—”

But I think the fear that “AGAIN” would pop up on our phones drove him to start rummaging for some paper, start scribbling some words on it, while the rest of us tried to soak in the reprieve of *nothing happening.* Every half-second a luxury.

I wanted to say “sorry” another twenty or so times—something I was sure wasn’t a feeling unique to me.

“I feel like I’m losing myself,” I said. It felt like I was in a dream at this point.

“Yeah,” said Ravi. “*Yeah.*”

“We’re…” Hiro said, looking at us carefully. “Probably all gonna die. Should we like, say our words, I guess?”

“Don’t—don’t talk like that,” said Evelyn.

“How many people do you think are dead?” Hiro asked.

I went to the TV (temporarily free yet again from one or two word mandates), turned it on, toggled through the home page until I found the livestream of a soccer game.

One fixed camera angle. Everyone in the stadium—torn apart. Players on the field within frame—eviscerated.

I returned to the home page, navigating in an attempt to find a different live program. I clicked on what appeared to be a news channel I hadn’t heard of before.

The sight of an empty desk appeared. Wires leading under the desk made me think that perhaps the anchor was hiding under it.

“We are trying to report,” he said, “knowing that the signal is going to cut out. I’ve survived so far, survived whatever exactly this might be, but the carnage from footage I’ve seen is extensive. *I strongly recommend—*”

The broadcast was interrupted by the new word:

**“SEEK”**

Again, in classical lettering. 

And the screen cracked, then shattered with a loud pop, sending bits of glass onto the floor—

As did the screen on my phone that I’d placed on the coffee table—

As did the phones in Evelyn and Hiro’s hands too, reactively dropped on the floor by the pair, a weak bounce before settling—

I panicked.

“Seek, *seek*—” I said desperately, trying to jolt my brain to the task. 

“Maybe something out of place?” Evelyn said.

“What if we have to find what’s killing everyone?” said Hiro.

“I don’t…” I started, but I couldn’t even muster up a close to the sentence.

I ran to the balcony, outside, to see if there was something obvious to look for—in the sky, in the city. What I spotted on the neighboring high-rises was bloodstained curtains, unrecognizable bodies where blinds were lifted, and—as my eyes darted from spot to spot—*a lead.*

A small TV in one of the apartments. The screen looked unbroken. A word on it I couldn’t make out—five letters was the best I could do.

“*It’s the screens,”* I said. “We need to find a screen that still works!”

I ran back into the living room.

“Does anyone have binoculars?”

They all looked at me.

“Why the fuck would anyone have binoculars?” Ravi asked.

“There’s a—there’s a screen *I think,* in one of the other apartment buildings, it’s working, there’s a word, but I can’t see it—we need to find another one, I don’t know, I—”

I ran into Ravi’s office. Computer screen broken. *Fuck.* Grabbed his laptop—shattered. *Nope.*

I nervously tapped my chest with the fingertips of both of my hands while the rest desperately searched for something viable too.

*Did I have to run to the other apartment?*

*Would there even be enough time?*

*How would I even get in?*

And then, like a bolt of the blue, it hit me.

“Ravi, where’s your phone?”

His voice was a little confused. “I don’t know man I lose it all the time—”

“*Find it.”*

“You really think that’s it?” 

“We’re looking for a functioning screen—it’s the only one we haven’t ruled out yet.” I turned to Hiro next. “Check out the other apartments on this floor. See if any of the doors are unlocked—if they are, go inside, check everything—phones, laptops, TVs, doesn’t matter, see if there’s a message intact on any of them.”

“On it,” he said, rushing to the door, opening it, freaking out at the body in front of it, nearly tripping, then composing himself and rushing into the hallway as the door closed behind him. 

We tore apart Ravi’s apartment next.

*Couch cushions.* “Where do you usually lose it?” I asked.

*My head peeked under the bed.* Peeked into counters alongside Evelyn, desperately. “I don’t man,” he answered, “it’s stupid but sometimes I literally just chuck it across the room—”

*Helpful—supremely helpful.*

In the bathroom, I looked in the medicine cabinet. Then—back into his room, to his closet, checking the pockets of all of his pants. I started to feel the inevitable looming. *This was the one that was going to kill us, wasn’t it?* 

“Love you guys,” I heard Evelyn say almost under her breath, like she could feel it too. 

No tangible ticker counting down, but a feeling in my chest. A train closing in, with us tied to the tracks.

Ravi running to the TV stand, looking behind, then, under books, under shelves—

And I was back in the living room again, *sure* there was nothing left, my eyes lowering to the painful game we’d started our deadly evening with—Monopoly.

Specifically, to the messy pile of 50’s, 20’s and 10’s on Ravi’s side of the board. I knew his etiquette for swapping some of them out for hundreds was quite poor. The cash stacked high, which made sense—he was *crushing* all game. *And yet—*

I crouched and did an even more aggressive sweep of the spot that we’d started our desperate search at, to discover his preserved Samsung Galaxy A35 underneath the fake money, with a new word to greet me:

**“SMILE”**

And it really did feel like time was up this time. 

“Ifoundityouhavetosmile!” I screamed like a goddamn auctioneer.

Evelyn turned first from her spot in the kitchen—“What?!”

I ripped the phone from the ground and held up the message to her. “Smile!”

She mirrored my uncomfortable expression—all teeth, feigned happiness—as did Ravi as he bolted out of the room before even seeing the message on the phone *or* my intense eyes—

Hiro threw open the door—

“Couldn’t find anything, I’m sorry!” he screamed. He saw our wide smiling faces and our eyes screaming at him to get the hint as I tried to mouth the word while keeping my pose, but instead it sounded like “SMUHHH.”

And yet, despite the confusing sight—

With the luckiest stroke in the world, he copied and showed me those pearly whites. 

I retained my beaming smile, feeling a tear of fear travel down my cheek, my eyes glued to Ravi’s phone in my hand, *hoping and praying that we wouldn’t all get torn apart—*

And the word disappeared. I showed the group the proof, and one by one our cheery expressions dropped to our default nervous frowns. *Resting scowl face restored.*

A collective exhale.

“I can’t fucking do this,” said Ravi.

“I know,” Evelyn added.

And unlike some of the gaps we’d been afforded in the past, I already spotted a new message on the single, remaining functional phone left in my right hand:

**“POINT TO SACRIFICE”**

I could feel the group’s eyes on me. I couldn’t hide the misery.

“What?” Ravi asked.

“Point to sacrifice,” I said, barely legible.

“AJ?” Evelyn asked.

I tilted the phone so they could read it. I couldn’t say the words any louder—my body wouldn’t let me.

Underneath the words, a timer had been running. One that was already down to *1:45, 1:44, 1:43* by the time I flashed them the phone.

And yet still, all of us needed more seconds to let it settle.

I felt defeated. Truly, this time.

“Alright,” said Ravi, cutting through the holding pattern. “So what? We talk it through with the time we have left? Maybe we all agree on someone to point at? I mean, hey, fuck knows what I have to live for.”

Hiro next. “I—my family, Mom, Dad, siblings, I wasn’t even thinking of them this whole time. They’re all probably dead, they—”

“Yeah,” I interrupted, his words hitting me immediately and curbing any remaining social etiquette I had left—*everyone I had ever known was likely gone—*“I, uhh, *wow*—”

Evelyn smiled at us softly. “I just have you guys now,” she said. “So uh yeah—*fuck this,*” she said, *immediately* pointing to herself, almost causing me to die right there in fear she’d be torn apart immediately, but the counter was still ticking down. “I flip the board on this bullshit,” she said, without wavering.

*1:12*

*1:11*

*1:10*

Hiro pointed to himself. “Fuck it—yeah. You know what, I flip the board too,” he said.

I looked at him, almost nervously, exasperated. “Really, after *all that*, guys?”

*1:07*

*1:06*

*1:05* 

“If there *is* a hell,” Ravi said, “Unlikely, but what the fuck—maybe we dodge that bullet.” He curled his index finger back towards himself. “Flip the fucking board.”

I just looked at them. It was strange to feel a deluge of selfish thoughts flood into me all at once.

*0:40*

*0:39*

*0:38*

“Alright,” I said, copying my peers. “Let’s do it.” I pointed at myself too, like we were all playing Simon says or something. 

*0:33*

*0:32*

*0:31*

I took an appreciative look at my old friends. The longest-standing friends I’d ever had in my stupid life.

And then, at the Monopoly board we were playing on. 

It really was quite an awful game—I wasn't sure why we’d always subject ourselves to it.

*0:27*

*0:26*

I saw the pile of money on “Free Parking.”

*0:23*

*0:22*

The only way to make it fun was to play with bullshit rules—house rules.

*0:20*

*0:19*

“Wait,” I said. “Follow me.” I sprinted to the door. 

I opened it, held it open for the rest.

*0:15*

*0:14* 

*0:13*

I pointed at Ravi’s dead neighbor in the hallway in front of the door. Monica. 

“We didn’t know what we were dealing with, until she died. Her *sacrifice* gave us a chance,” I said, almost looking up as if I was speaking to whoever was enacting this terror on us. 

I was aware it was a reach. 

*0:09*

*0:08*

“And we’ve probably lost a lot of humanity since then, so—sorry,” I said, pointing at her. “And thank you.”

*0:06*

*0:05*

And my best friends pointed too. A real morbid way to close things out, with a clash of “Sorry” and “Thank you” escaping them as what would likely be their last words—I had really interrupted what was quite a nice moment inside for this strangeness.

*0:02*

*0:01*

*0:00*

“House rules,” I said.

And then I prepared myself for it—*pain, then annihilation.* 

…

But nothing came.

Instead, Ravi’s phone in my hand just read—

**“GOOD GAME”**

Before defaulting to Ravi’s home page picture—a Borzoi. He didn’t even own one, he was just obsessed with that breed of dog.

We stood there for ten minutes it felt, before we finally ventured inside, single-file, like a group of polite zombies.

I was unsure what to make of what had happened—what to do, who to check on, the state of the world, what was going on around me.

I sat back down at the Monopoly board. The others, in an almost Manchurian candidate sort of way, took their spots too.

“I think it was my turn,” I said, slowly. 

I grabbed the dice. I rolled. It was a ten.

I tapped my Top Hat icon on each square until I landed on *Short Line Railroad*.

“Do you want to buy it?” Evelyn asked me.

I thought about it for too long. Finally—

“[Sure.](https://www.reddit.com/user/WorldAwayTweedy/)”",10394,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i2sie0/a_message_appeared_on_every_screen_in_the_world/,1737044171.0,nosleep,"A message appeared on every screen in the world: HIDE. I stared with confusion at my phone. The rest of the gang were all-in on this Monopoly game.

“I swear to God, if you get Free Parking I will literally kill your stupid face,” said Evelyn.

Ravi rolled the dice in his hands. “*Come on,* sweet baby Jesus. I just need a *four.*” He dropped them onto the board. “Fuck!” he said, probably biffing it like always.

I tried to make sense of it. Just a word on my screen—black text on an all white background, a rather classical-looking font: 

**“HIDE”**

I tapped, rather impatiently, on the expensive black rectangle. The text wouldn’t disappear. 

“*AJ*,” Evelyn called, like a teacher busting a student. “You’re fucking addicted. Play board games like a normal human adult.”

“Yeah, I—sorry.” A few more desperate fingerpecks at the screen, then I turned to holding the power button down for an extended period. With my free hand, I grabbed the dice, rolled a three, landed on *B & O Railroad.* After two seconds of thought—“Nah, fuck railroads,” I said.

Of course, we weren’t animals. If someone didn’t want to buy a property, that was fine. No auctions or any of that nonsense. *House rules.*

Back to the phone as Hiro, on my left, took the cubes and prepared to drag his sorry little shoe across *Go* to collect his two hundred dollars. A minute with the power button didn’t do anything—we were entering factory reset territory. I contemplated borrowing Ravi’s laptop to Google whatever the fuck this might have been. 

I felt the apartment rumble—albeit, just for a split second. As if we were on the edge of an earthquake. I tensed, briefly. 

The background noise from the TV—*No One Wants This* autoplaying on Netflix—disappeared, following the faint sound of the flicker of static. 

Ravi was the first to get up. “I don’t…” he said, talking slowly as if not to jinx it, “I don’t *think* that was an earthquake?” He examined the TV, confused at the outage. He checked the wires. “Shouldn’t be the breaker—I don’t have that much stuff plugged in, do I?” 

I grappled with the sad, likely *hacked* state of my phone—and that weird word staring me down.

“Damn, that’s fucking weird,” I heard Hiro say, half-laughing.

Head lifted. “What?” I asked to catch Hiro turning his phone to me. His home screen too had been replaced by black text atop white. “HIDE” 

Evelyn, as anti-technology as it comes, had properly clocked this reprieve as her time to quickly respond to long outstanding texts. “The fuck?” she said. “What… is this?” 

At my confused look—bordering on scowl, *resting scowl face*—she flipped her phone around to show me the damage. It was the same on hers. 

I grew a bit nervous. “Ravi, where’s your phone?” I asked him.

“I’m sure it’s somewhere,” he said, still tinkering with the TV. Likely not due to any of his troubleshooting, it flashed back to life, red power light at the base blinking steadily.

A simple message now appeared on the big screen. 

“Hide?” Ravi asked, grabbing the remote and pressing buttons to switch back to Netflix, but nothing was registering.

“Dude,” I said. He turned around. I showed him my phone—Hiro and Evelyn showed theirs.

“That’s…” he looked back at the TV, then at us again, “wait *how is that possible?”*

“Is that like an amber alert?” Hiro asked.

“I mean I guess but that’s a push notification, this is like, *completely overtaking the screen.*” Ravi’s brows furrowed. “On different hardware, too.”

“A hack?” I asked.

He shrugged. “That’s kind of a weird hack, no?” 

“Government experiment?” Hiro again.

A thought came over me.

I walked to the balcony, slid the door open, stepped out onto it. Eye of Sauron’d the city from Ravi’s fourteenth floor apartment. 

In the neighboring apartment towers, most of the units had blinds down, curtains closed. The few unshuttered however—*I felt like that guy from Rear Window*—contained strangers staring perplexed at their phones. At their computers. The sides of bolted-to-the-wall TVs, barely visible to me, displayed the same white background with text atop it. What I was seeing, everyone else was seeing.

The others joined me on the balcony. 

“Whatever it is, it’s at least hit this block,” I said. I looked down at the city streets—most of the people below caught in a similar holding pattern of standing frozen, heads fixed to their devices. 

“I guess we don’t have anything to call the cops with?” Hiro. 

“I’m sure they’re aware.” Me.

“Maybe wait it out until they fix it?” Ravi.

I nodded. And yet, I could tell Evelyn was a bit perturbed. Forcing magnetic thoughts to imbue her silence with weight. “Thoughts?” I asked her.

“I mean, should we do it?” she asked.

“Do what?” Ravi. 

“Hide.” Her again.

“Hide where?” Ravi again. 

“I don’t know,” she said.

“I mean, we’re already in my apartment. I’m sure that’s—good enough, right?” he said.

A pause.  

“Let’s not lose our heads,” Ravi continued. “This is nuts but it’s not—I mean it’s not like, *literally hide,* right?”

Hiro clicked his fingers. “What if it’s viral marketing? Like for a movie?” Hiro with the necessary but unintentional levity.

“*Hacking our phones so we can’t use them?* I don’t know if that’s in Lionsgate’s purview, man,” I said, then, head turned to Evelyn. “But *hide?*”

The flicker in her eyes more than meant that she’d sided with the lightbulb in her head. She returned to the inside, and got to exploring Ravi’s apartment carefully. 

“What are you doing?” Ravi asked, trailing. Hiro and I followed.

“I don’t care if I look stupid. It could be a warning. Maybe something is happening,” she said. 

“We’re in a box in a box, basically,” said Ravi. “We’re fine Ev.”

“But the fucking *thing,*” she motioned to the TV, then to her own phone, “says *hide.* Maybe it’s *that* literal.” She continued scouting, finally settling on the sliding closet in Ravi’s room—the best she could come up with in his 600 square foot quarters. “I’ll do here unless you think there’s better.”

“*Evelyn*,” Ravi stressed.

She shuffled in, past hung garments, scooching to the end to make space. “I’m gonna close the door soon, and if you’re all *really* my friends, you’ll join me.” 

Awkward silence until Hiro chimed first—

“I mean, guess it’s good to be safe right?” He went for it, second-guessed for a second, then committed to entering.

“You guys get the luxury of laughing at me forever if I’m dumb—win-win,” she called while Hiro wedged in beside her. A compelling argument, certainly.

Begrudgingly, I followed, tucking in next under Ravi’s dress clothes. There was still room for him inside his own closet.

“Fucking hell,” he caved, joining last, sliding the door closed to introduce darkness.

I went back to my phone. Still that classical font. Still that mandate.

“How long do we have to stay in here?” Ravi asked.

“Five minutes,” she said.

“Yeesh,” he tagged.

And then we sat in stillness for a while.

Distant *tick tick ticks* of the clock in the living room bringing down the blood pressure a tad. 

It all felt—silly. Kind of fun.

“Remember when we went camping at Sunlight Groves?” Hiro asked. 

“*Glamping,*” Ravi clarified.

“Ev thought she saw a bear.” Hiro laughed. “A bear and its cub.”

“It was dark, it fucking *looked like bears,*” she said, half-laughing herself. “I heard noises too.” 

“Bears at *Sunlight Groves,*” he said again. “Saddest patch of trees in America.” 

“Guys, shut up. We’re here so let’s commit to the bit. Before the *Conjuring* doll gets us,” said Ravi, surprisingly not bitterly.

We kept our traps zipped for another minute. 

Eyes at my phone again. “HIDE”—nonsensical, all of it really, but in a way that was starting to sit more and more uncomfortably for me. 

“What do you think it is?” Hiro whispered.

I shook my head. Evelyn with the light shrug. Ravi with a deep inhale before speaking. “I mean, *obviously sophisticated,*” he said, voice low. “Like it’s—yeah, it’s obviously *something*.”

I waved my phone. “My bank is on this and it’s bricked now basically? I’m fucked.”

“They’ll figure something out,” said Ravi.

Powerful knocks at his apartment door all of a sudden. Thundering.

“Hey!” a voice called, muffled through the walls. “Ravi, you there?”

Evelyn braced. *“Who is that?”*

“A skinwalker, obviously,” replied Ravi. “Kidding—my neighbor Monica.”  

Evelyn reached across me and Hiro to tug at Ravi’s sleeve. *“Are you positive?”*

“*Yes,* and I should probably get it.”

“You said five minutes,” she said.

“Yeah but I’m being a pretty trash neighbor right now,” he replied.

The knocking persisted. So did the words. *“I have this weird thing on my phone—Brad has it too. It says Hide? TV same thing, computer same thing, I don’t know how to reach anyone or what to do—*” the neighbor trailed on. 

Ravi blew air out of his nose. “Alright, this is stupid, I’m gonna—”

“No!” said Evelyn, but then all of a sudden—

He stopped. 

We all stopped. 

*I felt something*. Something very, very real—

No knocking anymore. Or at least, I couldn’t hear anything. Not the tick of the clock, nor the soft rustle of us against clothing. It was like the world was holding its breath. 

Like there was a *presence.* Right outside the closet. 

Then—the sting of static in my ear, before—

It passed. 

Whatever it was, the feeling dissipated, the sound returned, and I sneaked a glance at my phone—

The word HIDE was gone and replacing it was my home screen. 

The silence between the four of us was uncomfortable. 

“Did you feel that?” Evelyn finally whispered.

No one said anything. Ravi outstretched his arm yet again to slide the door open, but his hands were shaking. 

“You can do it,” I whispered. “I think we’re good.”

He steeled himself, looking very much like he was crossing some sort of internal threshold. He pulled the door aside, revealing his room exactly as we’d left it. 

We took it in. 

“I’m gonna answer Monica,” he said, with not a whole lot of vigor to his voice, getting up and creeping out of the room. The rest of us followed, stopping in the living room while he continued to the door.

I went to Twitter, searched ‘Hide’ and sorted by new. Evelyn, meanwhile, grabbed the remote from the stand and turned the TV—now “Hideless”–-on and maneuvered through the Roku channels.

“What are you looking for?” Hiro asked.

“Just like, a *live* channel, I guess.” she replied. “The news?” 

My scrolling wasn’t yielding anything of help or insight, though it was clear—via the confused posts from seemingly around the whole world—that the scope of whatever happened was global. 

My focus shifted to Ravi, who was standing on the welcome mat, eye pressed against the door’s peephole. He hadn’t moved in quite some time.

“Everything alright man?” I asked.

He didn’t reply. Just stood there, frozen.

I approached slowly. 

“She’s… she’s…” I heard him croak.

I reached him, patting him on the shoulders and urging him to detach from the door viewer. He finally did, leaning against the wall at first before slowly sliding to a seat on the floor.

I peered into the hallway through the hole.

Outside, his neighbor—the one knocking—

Looked like she’d been skewered. Decimated.

An explosion of blood in the hallway. 

“What…” I felt a buzz on my phone. I pulled it out.

**“AGAIN”**

Before I could even process, I heard Ravi and Evelyn react.

“There’s another one—”

“It says *again* now—”

I turned to see the foreboding word on the TV. “Fuck.”

“So we should hide again?” Hiro called.

Much like Ravi, I was shellshocked.

“AJ, what do you think we should do?” he repeated. 

“Evelyn,” I said, trying to force the words out of my mouth. “You had good instincts the first time—what—*what do you think*?”

“How much time do you think we have?” she asked.

*How much time passed between when I first saw the word HIDE and when we felt that presence in the closet?*

“It might’ve been ten minutes,” I heard Ravi mutter, almost lifeless. 

“I… don’t…” then Evelyn interrupted herself, “wait, what did you just see outside?”

She started approaching the door. I stopped her. “I don’t… think it’ll be good… for you to see it.”

“Are—are you serious?” she responded.

“*Yes,*” I said, immediately realizing that lying might have been smarter.

“We can’t assume we have the same amount of time,” Ravi added. 

I went with my pitch. “Do we try the same spot?” 

Hiro started pacing, thinking, tapping his foot. “It’s—if we think about it, it said “hide” and we hid. Now it’s saying “again” and *obviously* that means that—whatever happened, is gonna—happen again.” He gave us a look, as if he could see, in our drained expressions, what was waiting on the other side of the door.

“That’s… a great recap man,” I said.

“What I mean,” he said, struggling, “is that when you’d play, as a kid, if you kept picking the same spot over and over, eventually it’d catch up to you.” 

“Are we really trying to apply some sort of logic to this?” Ravi mumbled.

Evelyn fortified herself. “I think he’s right. It’s *nuts* and I can’t believe I’m saying this, but we need to operate on gut. And *gut* tells me—we pick better spots this time.”

“But *spots* makes it sound like we should split up?” I said, looking around, slowly realizing that the limited real estate we had to work with meant this suggestion made more sense than I would’ve liked. I turned to Ravi. “Where should we all go?” 

He shook his head, palmed his forehead a few times as if to slap himself back to reality. “We do…” he started, thinking, “Two under my bed,” he grimaced, letting neurons collide in his mind, “One of us in the utility closet, the other… laundry closet.” He got up and pointed—one of the closets was right behind me. Life in him again. “Now!”

My eyes flitted to Hiro and Evelyn, who ran into the bedroom. 

Ravi gave me a nod, before entering the laundry closet and awkwardly squeezing in with the washer and dryer, closing his door.

I entered the utility closet, and closed mine.

Rather—I tried to. The door wasn’t clicking shut.

*“Fuck,”* I said, “Ravi, the door, it’s not—” but then I fought the urge to say anything more. If time was up, I’d compromise my spot, hell, compromise his spot too if I kept talking. I tried a few more times to get it to close, then—

I committed, terrified out of my mind, to gripping the handle and holding the door shut. I tried to keep my shaking hand and quickening breath in check as—

The silence overtook again. *Complete* silence, and *then,* that presence—

I felt a light tug at the door. I kept my hold firm but didn’t try to overpower–-didn’t want to completely give it away—

And again, it stopped. 

The feeling disappeared. And I waited fifteen seconds before sneaking a look at my phone, to see that the “AGAIN” warning was gone.

I heard the sound of Ravi’s door swing open first. I followed with mine.

He was emotional. “I forgot that that door is fucked, I got scared man, and I was—”

“You’re all good—it’s alright man, I know—”

“I even heard you call for me, and I didn’t, I—I panicked and I thought it’d—”

“We’re alive man, it’s alright, we’re—” and immediately I remembered it wasn’t just *us*. “*Evelyn and Hiro.*”

“Right,” he said. We rushed to his bedroom.

Nothing—at first. The two hadn’t emerged yet. For a moment, the horrifying thought that we’d be pulling their corpses out from under the bed rushed past me.

“Guys,” I said, “Coast is clear. Quick—”

Silence. For quite some time, before they finally shuffled out in one piece, alive.

As they shifted from crawl to bend to standing, I wanted to hold them. Hold everyone. For just a second, I felt a newfound appreciation for life and their faces and personalities.

Another buzz on my phone. I took a look: 

**“BREAK TIME”**

I let out a sigh of relief and showed the message to the others. 

“I guess that’s good,” Evelyn said. “A second to catch our breaths, after this fucking *craziness.*”

“But then what?” Ravi asked. “Is this just gonna *continue?*”

We walked into the living room together, nervously.

“We haven’t even gotten a single second to wrap our heads around this,” Evelyn again. 

Something in me didn’t seem right. 

I didn’t feel good. 

“Hey, Ev, how’d you know that we should’ve stayed in the closet for five minutes?” Hiro asked, somewhat pointedly.

I clocked minor annoyance in her face at the question. “I didn’t *know* anything—it was a guess. But I mean, yeah, you guys were fucking lucky I was here and pushed for it, because *fuck* were you all being stubborn.” 

Hiro wore a strange expression as he looked at her. “Alright.”

“Sounds like you want to say something more,” she said.

“Why would I? What makes you think I’d—”

Ravi interrupted Hiro by stepping between the two of them. “*Holy hell,* keep your heads on people,” but as he said it, and maybe it was just an aberration in my mind, but I couldn’t help but feel something significant stir within me, something *really* inflame, as if even though his face was straight he was concealing some sort of inner smile at what was happening.

“Hiro, I think you’re focusing your skepticism in the wrong direction,” I said.

Ravi’s expression turned irritated, which all but confirmed it for me. 

“I don’t know if you want to be mad at the person that saved us the first time,” I said, trying to make a point by motioning to Evelyn, but as I looked at her, something felt wrong there too. I contained it. “Or rather, the person who wanted to *open the closet door*.”

And then something even more obvious hit me.

“Wait, Ravi, *you tried to kill me*.”

And all of a sudden, I was glaring at him, my temper rising by metric tons every second as if it was all starting to make sense. Evelyn and Hiro joined me.

Ravi looked incredulous. “I already admitted that I fucked up with the door—*I confessed to you!* Why are you trying to make things worse? I was trying to calm them down—” then, noticing us approach him, he backed towards the kitchen cabinets. He pointed at me. “You were on your phone when this first happened,” he said, as if he were having his own revelation. “You were waiting—waiting for it to start—”

“That’s an *insane* fucking misdirect,” I said, positive that I couldn’t trust him. But as my eyes turned to Evelyn and Hiro, I realized I couldn’t trust them either, couldn’t trust anyone. 

*Still,* Ravi absolutely needed to be the first to go, the first to be disposed of. 

He grabbed a knife from the cupboard and held it out at us.

And only the smallest thought in the back of my mind was telling me that we were being toyed with—that it was so incredibly obvious that whatever this was, it had a handle on us, but unfortunately that understanding was academic for me at best, as I kept finding string after string of thoughts and emotions connecting, everything adding up, the logic *sound*, my emotions *inflamed*—

“Break time,” Evelyn said. “It’s breaking us.”

*Of course she would know that though, if she were in on it.*

We all looked at her. I watched for sudden movements from any of these traitors—these bastards. Even a millimeter shift wouldn’t get past me.

“It’s overriding us, it’s flooding us with anger that isn’t ours, and *real as it feels*—”

She faced her phone at us, beckoning us to read it clearly:

**“BREAK TIME”**

“We can’t fall to it.”

And that small grounded part of me took over, even though I was sure with everything in my soul that she, Ravi, and Hiro were the source of everything that was happening. 

Ravi’s grip on the knife tightened as he and the rest of us remained in the bizarre equilibrium of our four-way stand off. 

*It’s all of you,* I thought to myself, before I felt a lightness overtake me. 

Like an insatiable hunger fading, or extreme fear dissipating when you realize that noise in the other room wasn’t a person but rather something knocking over, my feelings of unrest and paranoia were gone. My phone screen, once again, returned to its default background.

It was hard to describe how I felt now. *Lucidity. Shame.* I looked at Ravi sadly. His head hung low as he put the knife back in its place.

Hiro turned to Evelyn first. “I’m sorry,” he said. Then to Ravi. “Sorry.”

“Sorry guys,” Ravi.

“I’m sorry.” Me.

“You’re welcome, assholes.” Evelyn. *We deserved that.*

“That was fucking—insane,” Ravi said.

“Like a fucked up rollercoaster ride,” said Evelyn.

“I didn’t—that, *that wasn’t totally me*,” Hiro said. “Like, *something was in me*, and it was—”

“It’s okay man.” I was getting tired of saying it, and certainly I out of everyone didn’t deserve to impart forgiveness anyway after where my own head was at only thirty seconds ago. 

“We need to like, write something down—like *we are susceptible. Don’t forget—”* started Ravi.

“We just need to remember to keep your heads on,” I interrupted, “Remember—”

But I think the fear that “AGAIN” would pop up on our phones drove him to start rummaging for some paper, start scribbling some words on it, while the rest of us tried to soak in the reprieve of *nothing happening.* Every half-second a luxury.

I wanted to say “sorry” another twenty or so times—something I was sure wasn’t a feeling unique to me.

“I feel like I’m losing myself,” I said. It felt like I was in a dream at this point.

“Yeah,” said Ravi. “*Yeah.*”

“We’re…” Hiro said, looking at us carefully. “Probably all gonna die. Should we like, say our words, I guess?”

“Don’t—don’t talk like that,” said Evelyn.

“How many people do you think are dead?” Hiro asked.

I went to the TV (temporarily free yet again from one or two word mandates), turned it on, toggled through the home page until I found the livestream of a soccer game.

One fixed camera angle. Everyone in the stadium—torn apart. Players on the field within frame—eviscerated.

I returned to the home page, navigating in an attempt to find a different live program. I clicked on what appeared to be a news channel I hadn’t heard of before.

The sight of an empty desk appeared. Wires leading under the desk made me think that perhaps the anchor was hiding under it.

“We are trying to report,” he said, “knowing that the signal is going to cut out. I’ve survived so far, survived whatever exactly this might be, but the carnage from footage I’ve seen is extensive. *I strongly recommend—*”

The broadcast was interrupted by the new word:

**“SEEK”**

Again, in classical lettering. 

And the screen cracked, then shattered with a loud pop, sending bits of glass onto the floor—

As did the screen on my phone that I’d placed on the coffee table—

As did the phones in Evelyn and Hiro’s hands too, reactively dropped on the floor by the pair, a weak bounce before settling—

I panicked.

“Seek, *seek*—” I said desperately, trying to jolt my brain to the task. 

“Maybe something out of place?” Evelyn said.

“What if we have to find what’s killing everyone?” said Hiro.

“I don’t…” I started, but I couldn’t even muster up a close to the sentence.

I ran to the balcony, outside, to see if there was something obvious to look for—in the sky, in the city. What I spotted on the neighboring high-rises was bloodstained curtains, unrecognizable bodies where blinds were lifted, and—as my eyes darted from spot to spot—*a lead.*

A small TV in one of the apartments. The screen looked unbroken. A word on it I couldn’t make out—five letters was the best I could do.

“*It’s the screens,”* I said. “We need to find a screen that still works!”

I ran back into the living room.

“Does anyone have binoculars?”

They all looked at me.

“Why the fuck would anyone have binoculars?” Ravi asked.

“There’s a—there’s a screen *I think,* in one of the other apartment buildings, it’s working, there’s a word, but I can’t see it—we need to find another one, I don’t know, I—”

I ran into Ravi’s office. Computer screen broken. *Fuck.* Grabbed his laptop—shattered. *Nope.*

I nervously tapped my chest with the fingertips of both of my hands while the rest desperately searched for something viable too.

*Did I have to run to the other apartment?*

*Would there even be enough time?*

*How would I even get in?*

And then, like a bolt of the blue, it hit me.

“Ravi, where’s your phone?”

His voice was a little confused. “I don’t know man I lose it all the time—”

“*Find it.”*

“You really think that’s it?” 

“We’re looking for a functioning screen—it’s the only one we haven’t ruled out yet.” I turned to Hiro next. “Check out the other apartments on this floor. See if any of the doors are unlocked—if they are, go inside, check everything—phones, laptops, TVs, doesn’t matter, see if there’s a message intact on any of them.”

“On it,” he said, rushing to the door, opening it, freaking out at the body in front of it, nearly tripping, then composing himself and rushing into the hallway as the door closed behind him. 

We tore apart Ravi’s apartment next.

*Couch cushions.* “Where do you usually lose it?” I asked.

*My head peeked under the bed.* Peeked into counters alongside Evelyn, desperately. “I don’t man,” he answered, “it’s stupid but sometimes I literally just chuck it across the room—”

*Helpful—supremely helpful.*

In the bathroom, I looked in the medicine cabinet. Then—back into his room, to his closet, checking the pockets of all of his pants. I started to feel the inevitable looming. *This was the one that was going to kill us, wasn’t it?* 

“Love you guys,” I heard Evelyn say almost under her breath, like she could feel it too. 

No tangible ticker counting down, but a feeling in my chest. A train closing in, with us tied to the tracks.

Ravi running to the TV stand, looking behind, then, under books, under shelves—

And I was back in the living room again, *sure* there was nothing left, my eyes lowering to the painful game we’d started our deadly evening with—Monopoly.

Specifically, to the messy pile of 50’s, 20’s and 10’s on Ravi’s side of the board. I knew his etiquette for swapping some of them out for hundreds was quite poor. The cash stacked high, which made sense—he was *crushing* all game. *And yet—*

I crouched and did an even more aggressive sweep of the spot that we’d started our desperate search at, to discover his preserved Samsung Galaxy A35 underneath the fake money, with a new word to greet me:

**“SMILE”**

And it really did feel like time was up this time. 

“Ifoundityouhavetosmile!” I screamed like a goddamn auctioneer.

Evelyn turned first from her spot in the kitchen—“What?!”

I ripped the phone from the ground and held up the message to her. “Smile!”

She mirrored my uncomfortable expression—all teeth, feigned happiness—as did Ravi as he bolted out of the room before even seeing the message on the phone *or* my intense eyes—

Hiro threw open the door—

“Couldn’t find anything, I’m sorry!” he screamed. He saw our wide smiling faces and our eyes screaming at him to get the hint as I tried to mouth the word while keeping my pose, but instead it sounded like “SMUHHH.”

And yet, despite the confusing sight—

With the luckiest stroke in the world, he copied and showed me those pearly whites. 

I retained my beaming smile, feeling a tear of fear travel down my cheek, my eyes glued to Ravi’s phone in my hand, *hoping and praying that we wouldn’t all get torn apart—*

And the word disappeared. I showed the group the proof, and one by one our cheery expressions dropped to our default nervous frowns. *Resting scowl face restored.*

A collective exhale.

“I can’t fucking do this,” said Ravi.

“I know,” Evelyn added.

And unlike some of the gaps we’d been afforded in the past, I already spotted a new message on the single, remaining functional phone left in my right hand:

**“POINT TO SACRIFICE”**

I could feel the group’s eyes on me. I couldn’t hide the misery.

“What?” Ravi asked.

“Point to sacrifice,” I said, barely legible.

“AJ?” Evelyn asked.

I tilted the phone so they could read it. I couldn’t say the words any louder—my body wouldn’t let me.

Underneath the words, a timer had been running. One that was already down to *1:45, 1:44, 1:43* by the time I flashed them the phone.

And yet still, all of us needed more seconds to let it settle.

I felt defeated. Truly, this time.

“Alright,” said Ravi, cutting through the holding pattern. “So what? We talk it through with the time we have left? Maybe we all agree on someone to point at? I mean, hey, fuck knows what I have to live for.”

Hiro next. “I—my family, Mom, Dad, siblings, I wasn’t even thinking of them this whole time. They’re all probably dead, they—”

“Yeah,” I interrupted, his words hitting me immediately and curbing any remaining social etiquette I had left—*everyone I had ever known was likely gone—*“I, uhh, *wow*—”

Evelyn smiled at us softly. “I just have you guys now,” she said. “So uh yeah—*fuck this,*” she said, *immediately* pointing to herself, almost causing me to die right there in fear she’d be torn apart immediately, but the counter was still ticking down. “I flip the board on this bullshit,” she said, without wavering.

*1:12*

*1:11*

*1:10*

Hiro pointed to himself. “Fuck it—yeah. You know what, I flip the board too,” he said.

I looked at him, almost nervously, exasperated. “Really, after *all that*, guys?”

*1:07*

*1:06*

*1:05* 

“If there *is* a hell,” Ravi said, “Unlikely, but what the fuck—maybe we dodge that bullet.” He curled his index finger back towards himself. “Flip the fucking board.”

I just looked at them. It was strange to feel a deluge of selfish thoughts flood into me all at once.

*0:40*

*0:39*

*0:38*

“Alright,” I said, copying my peers. “Let’s do it.” I pointed at myself too, like we were all playing Simon says or something. 

*0:33*

*0:32*

*0:31*

I took an appreciative look at my old friends. The longest-standing friends I’d ever had in my stupid life.

And then, at the Monopoly board we were playing on. 

It really was quite an awful game—I wasn't sure why we’d always subject ourselves to it.

*0:27*

*0:26*

I saw the pile of money on “Free Parking.”

*0:23*

*0:22*

The only way to make it fun was to play with bullshit rules—house rules.

*0:20*

*0:19*

“Wait,” I said. “Follow me.” I sprinted to the door. 

I opened it, held it open for the rest.

*0:15*

*0:14* 

*0:13*

I pointed at Ravi’s dead neighbor in the hallway in front of the door. Monica. 

“We didn’t know what we were dealing with, until she died. Her *sacrifice* gave us a chance,” I said, almost looking up as if I was speaking to whoever was enacting this terror on us. 

I was aware it was a reach. 

*0:09*

*0:08*

“And we’ve probably lost a lot of humanity since then, so—sorry,” I said, pointing at her. “And thank you.”

*0:06*

*0:05*

And my best friends pointed too. A real morbid way to close things out, with a clash of “Sorry” and “Thank you” escaping them as what would likely be their last words—I had really interrupted what was quite a nice moment inside for this strangeness.

*0:02*

*0:01*

*0:00*

“House rules,” I said.

And then I prepared myself for it—*pain, then annihilation.* 

…

But nothing came.

Instead, Ravi’s phone in my hand just read—

**“GOOD GAME”**

Before defaulting to Ravi’s home page picture—a Borzoi. He didn’t even own one, he was just obsessed with that breed of dog.

We stood there for ten minutes it felt, before we finally ventured inside, single-file, like a group of polite zombies.

I was unsure what to make of what had happened—what to do, who to check on, the state of the world, what was going on around me.

I sat back down at the Monopoly board. The others, in an almost Manchurian candidate sort of way, took their spots too.

“I think it was my turn,” I said, slowly. 

I grabbed the dice. I rolled. It was a ten.

I tapped my Top Hat icon on each square until I landed on *Short Line Railroad*.

“Do you want to buy it?” Evelyn asked me.

I thought about it for too long. Finally—

GME and Plan B. It Happened!,"**TLDR: GameStop has officially adopted a B T C playbook, and holy crap, it's actually happening. They've announced a $1.3 BILLION convertible note offering specifically mentioning B T C acquisition as the intended use of proceeds. This is the first phase of a multi-decade transformation that leaves short sellers in shambles, rocket shareholder value to Uranus, and position GME as a financial revolutionary in an increasingly digital world.**

*Explosion emoji intensifies*

*Bewilderment intensifies.*

For those who read my post from a few months back where I outlined how GME could nuke shorts by adopting B T C as a treasury asset, following MSTR's playbook...

Well, apes, it's time to abandon the tinfoil hats because it's happening. **They actually did it.**

GameStop has gone full gigachad with a $1.3 BILLION convertible note offering explicitly mentioning B T C acquisition.

**Here's my post from a few months ago on this sub.**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ikq1en/gme\_and\_plan\_b/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ikq1en/gme_and_plan_b/)

**If you haven't been following the news, GameStop has just announced they're adopting a B T C treasury strategy, joining the ranks of MicroStrategy and other forward-thinking companies that understand we're living through the early days of a monetary revolution.**

I've been glued to my screen since this announcement dropped, watching as the market reaction plays out. But this isn't about immediate and short-term price action. This is about a fundamental realignment of GameStop's value proposition that will play out over years, not days - and the convertible note offering is rocket fuel for what's to come.

**The Announcement That Changes Everything**

The press release doesn't mince words. GameStop has announced:

1. A $1.3 BILLION convertible note offering (with potential for an additional $200 million)

1. 0.00% interest rate - yes, you read that right, ZERO PERCENT

1. Explicitly stated the proceeds would be used for ""general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of B T C in a manner consistent with GameStop's Investment Policy.""

1. Notes mature on April 1, 2030 (five years from now)

1. Initial conversion price of $29.85 (37.5% premium over current price)

This is straight out of the M S T R playbook.

For years, the traditional financial system has convinced retail investors that they have a fair shot in the markets. But as GME apes discovered, the game is rigged. The spoon bends when market makers and prime brokers want it to. The timing of GME's B T C strategy announcement is not coincidental - it's strategic.

**The Playbook: GME Edition**

What GameStop is doing follows the exact blueprint that Michael Saylor laid out with M S T R, and they're executing it masterfully. Let me break down what's happening and what I think is coming next.

**Phase 1: Initial Allocation** (HAPPENING NOW)

* $1.3 billion from convertible notes to be deployed for B T C acquisition

* Potential additional $200 million if option is exercised

* This immediately establishes GME as a significant holder

**Phase 2: Establish the Flywheel** (COMING SOON)

* As B T C price rises, GME's stock gains a premium

* Market sentiment shifts from ""struggling retailer"" to "" B T C proxy with retail upside and a profitable core business""

* Short sellers begin feeling pain as their thesis becomes obsolete

**Phase 3: Leverage the Premium** (FUTURE)

* Issue more debt at favorable terms

* Use proceeds to acquire more

* Rinse and repeat, creating a virtuous cycle that squeezes shorts

Let's look closer at this convertible note offering - it's pure financial wizardry. Zero percent interest means they're borrowing $1.3 billion with NO INTEREST PAYMENTS. The notes mature in 2030, by which time B T C will likely have gone through another 1-2 halving cycles and appreciated significantly.

The conversion price of $29.85 represents a 37.5% premium over the current stock price. If the stock stays below that price, GameStop keeps the $1.3 billion to stack more B T C. If the stock rises above that level (which is likely given their new strategy), the notes convert to shares at a price that's already at a premium.

**The Numbers**

Let's run some projections based on GameStop's convertible note offering and the current B T C price of $82,700:

Convertible note proceeds: $1.3 billion (potentially $1.5 billion with the extra option)

At current B T C prices: $1.3 billion ÷ $82,700 = \~15,720 BTC (or up to \~18,138 BTC if the additional $200 million option is exercised)

This would immediately make GameStop one of the largest corporate holders in the world.

* Outstanding shares: roughly 450,000,000 shares

* Convertible notes: $1.3 billion at a conversion price of $29.85 per share

* Potential additional shares from conversion: $1.3 billion ÷ $29.85 = \~43,551,088 shares

* Total potential fully diluted shares: \~493,551,088

Let's run some numbers based on various B T C price projections:

**Conservative Case ($150,000 B T C by 2026)**:

* 15,720 BTC × $150,000 = $2.36 billion

* Per share value contribution: \~$5.24 (based on 450M shares) or \~$4.78 (fully diluted)

**Base Case ($500,000 B T C by 2028)**:

* 15,720 BTC × $500,000 = $7.86 billion

* Per share value contribution: \~$17.47 (based on 450M shares) or \~$15.93 (fully diluted)

**Bullish Case ($1,000,000 B T C by 2030)**:

* 15,720 BTC × $1,000,000 = $15.72 billion

* Per share value contribution: \~$34.93 (based on 450M shares) or \~$31.85 (fully diluted)

But here's the kicker - B T C treasury companies typically trade at a premium to their holdings. M S T R has traded anywhere from 1.2x to 3x its holdings.

**Applying a modest 2x premium:**

* Conservative case: \~$10.48 per share (or \~$9.56 fully diluted)

* Base case: \~$34.94 per share (or \~$31.86 fully diluted)

* Bullish case: \~$69.86 per share (or \~$63.70 fully diluted)

And the beautiful part? The notes mature in 2030, right when B T C might be reaching that bullish case according to many analysts. The timing couldn't be more perfect.

**Beyond The Initial Raise: The Big Picture Projections**

Let's take this a step further. GameStop currently has over $4 billion in cash on its balance sheet in addition to this $1.3 billion convertible offering. What if they go all-in on the B T C strategy like M S T R did?

Let's project what happens if GameStop deploys a total of $6 billion into B T C over time (using their existing cash plus the convertible notes):

At an average purchase price between $82,700 and $100,000: $6 billion ÷ $90,000 (average) = \~66,667 B T C

Now let's apply the original post's ARR (Annual Rate of Return) projections with the updated share count:

* Outstanding shares: 450,000,000 shares

* Potential shares from full conversion: \~43,551,088 shares

* Total potential fully diluted shares: \~493,551,088

**Bearish Case (12% ARR):**

* Starting value in 2025: $6,000,000,000

* 2035 Value = $6,000,000,000 \* (1 + 0.12)\^10 = $18,635,099,969

* 2045 Value = $6,000,000,000 \* (1 + 0.12)\^20 = $57,916,123,317

**Base Case (27% ARR):**

* Starting value in 2025: $6,000,000,000

* 2035 Value = $6,000,000,000 \* (1 + 0.27)\^10 = $69,473,249,781

* 2045 Value = $6,000,000,000 \* (1 + 0.27)\^20 = $798,331,160,152

**Bullish Case (37% ARR):**

* Starting value in 2025: $6,000,000,000

* 2035 Value = $6,000,000,000 \* (1 + 0.37)\^10 = $145,486,361,781

* 2045 Value = $6,000,000,000 \* (1 + 0.37)\^20 = $3,518,980,996,027

**What would this mean for the stock price by 2035?**

**Bearish Case:**

* B T C value per share: $41.41 (based on 450M shares) or $37.76 (fully diluted)

* With 2x premium: $82.82 or $75.52 fully diluted (302% increase from current price)

**Base Case:**

* B T C value per share: $154.38 (based on 450M shares) or $140.76 (fully diluted)

* With 2x premium: $308.76 or $281.52 fully diluted (1,126% increase from current price)

**Bullish Case:**

* B T C value per share: $323.30 (based on 450M shares) or $294.78 (fully diluted)

* With 2x premium: $646.60 or $589.56 fully diluted (2,358% increase from current price)

**And by 2045?**

**Bearish Case:**

* B T C value per share: $128.70 (based on 450M shares) or $117.35 (fully diluted)

* With 2x premium: $257.40 or $234.70 fully diluted (939% increase from current price)

**Base Case:**

* B T C value per share: $1,774.07 (based on 450M shares) or $1,617.52 (fully diluted)

* With 2x premium: $3,548.14 or $3,235.04 fully diluted (12,940% increase from current price)

**Bullish Case:**

* B T C value per share: $7,820.00 (based on 450M shares) or $7,130.02 (fully diluted)

* With 2x premium: $15,640.00 or $14,260.04 fully diluted (57,056% increase from current price)

\*""\*If you aren't first you're last"" -Ricky Bobby

These projections are derived from B T C actual historical performance. And remember, these are just based on holdings - they don't include any value from GameStop's core business or future innovations.

They are also sand-bagged. Like...a lot.

Consider that most stocks in the Tech space trade at Price to Earnings ratios of 25-30. Right now it's so early in the BTC treasury game, and BTC bears are debating why a company holding BTC like M S T R should even trade above it's intrinsic value.

I think this thesis will die in the next few years as it becomes clear you can convert B T C holdings into straight earnings because of B T C performance and because of being able to leverage it in ways that M S T R is just now starting to reveal (things like STRK and STRF, going after huge markets like fixed income).

There will be a MASSIVE advantage to the few companies that accumulate huge stacks of B T C at these prices, because soon nobody will be able to buy anywhere close to this amount without sending the B T C price to the moon.

There is simply not enough of it available.

Once we get a few more years into this financial revolution, and nation states and MAG-7 companies are involved, companies like M S T R and GME who have massive stacks, are going to hit escape velocity from everyone else.

That's the advantage of being the first significant sized company with a lot of assets to adopt the M S T R playbook.

The NAV premium will grow...a lot. Imagine GME and M S T R trading at 5-15x NAV premium in 10 years, instead of 2. I very much think that is in play.

Also...there's the whole giant elephant in the room. If there are in fact massive short positions still in play that are hidden (I think this is the case), these prices absolutely do not reflect the face melting volatility and short squeeze/gamma squeeze events that will ensue.

AND. GME can continue to raise convertible debt funds to buy more and more B T C beyond their cash reserves if they so choose. Their stack could be substantially larger than these projections.

**The Perfect Storm for Shorts**

If you thought the original GME squeeze was intense, you ain't seen nothing yet. The new strategy creates a multi-layer trap for short sellers, and the convertible note offering just added rocket fuel:

1. **Immediate Pressure**: As market sentiment shifts, risk models for shorting GME change dramatically. With $1.3 billion in new capital targeting B T C, the risk profile for shorts just exploded.

1. **Medium-Term Squeeze**: As B T C price rises during this halving cycle, GME's underlying value increases, forcing periodic covering. Each B T C price milestone becomes a pain point for shorts.

1. **Long-Term Obliteration**: The flywheel effect of B T C appreciation → premium valuation → debt/equity issuance → more B T C acquisition becomes a death spiral for short positions.

With B T C currently trading at $82,700 and still in the early stages of its post-halving bull run, the timer is ticking for anyone holding short positions. It has historically seen its most dramatic price appreciation in the 12-18 months following a halving - we're right in that window now.

It's also not yet clear that we will see a dramatic violent prolonged bear market as in the past, now that the bid for B T C has shifted from retail to institutional capital and soon...nation states.

**The Hidden Short Positions**

Remember all those theories about massive hidden short positions through total return swaps, married puts, and other exotic instruments?

Those positions are now in serious jeopardy.

If GME was truly shorted multiple times over the float (as many including myself believe), those positions suddenly face a new reality: their collateral is now competing against an asset with a 44-46% compound annual growth rate over the last decade. And now, GameStop has just secured $1.3 billion to acquire this asset. And is sitting on another 4+ billion dollars of cash to acquire even more!

*""What we've got here is... failure to communicate.""* \- Cool Hand Luke

Shorts are about to learn an expensive lesson. Let me explain why this convertible note offering is particularly brutal for shorts:

1. **Zero Percent Interest** \- GameStop is borrowing $1.3 billion and paying NO interest. This means they can hold this capital indefinitely without bleeding cash.

1. **Conversion Premium** \- The notes convert at $29.85 per share, which is 37.5% above the current price. If the stock stays below this level, shorts might feel safe, but they're sitting under a sword of Damocles.

1. **Long Duration** \- The notes mature in 2030, giving GameStop five years to execute their strategy through at least one more halving cycle.

1. **Bear Trap** \- If shorts try to suppress the stock below the conversion price, they're actually helping GameStop acquire more B T C with less dilution - strengthening the company long-term.

*""It's a trap!""* \- Admiral Ackbar

**The Game Theory Masterclass: Checkmate in Four Moves**

*""In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces.""* \- Zapp Brannigan, Futurama

Let's talk about what's really happening here from a game theory perspective, because the strategic implications of GME's new play are absolutely mindblowing.

**Level 1: The Investor Base Transformation**

By adopting B T C as a treasury strategy, GameStop isn't just buying a digital asset – they're completely transforming their investor base. Suddenly, GameStop becomes attractive to:

1. B T C-focused hedge funds and family offices

1. Tech-forward institutional investors

1. B T C whales looking for stock market exposure

1. ETF providers seeking correlated equities

1. Momentum traders who follow B T C trends

This is a completely different investor profile than the traditional GameStop investor. These new players have deeper pockets, tend to have longer time horizons, and are accustomed to B T C volatility.

*""The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.""* \- Sun Tzu

**Level 2: The BlackRock Alliance**

Here's where it gets spicy. By aligning with B T C, GameStop has indirectly aligned itself with the world's largest asset manager – BlackRock – which now manages the I B I T, ETF. This isn't just any ETF; it's the fastest-growing ETF launch in financial history.

BlackRock has trillions of dollars under management and unparalleled influence across global capital markets. They don't lose battles they choose to fight. By implementing a B T C treasury strategy, GameStop has essentially recruited a financial behemoth as an ally.

This creates an asymmetric battlefield where the shorts, who may have had advantages in traditional markets, suddenly find themselves fighting against not just retail investors, but the combined might of the B T C community and institutional giants like BlackRock.

**Level 3: The Short Seller's Dilemma - Welcome to the TerrorDome**

*""Now you're in a whole new kind of trouble, aren't you?""* \- John Wick

Short sellers now face an impossible dilemma:

**Option A: Stay Short GME, Short B T C**

* If they double down by shorting both GME and B T C, they risk catastrophic losses if B T C continues its post-halving surge

* Every B T C price increase directly strengthens GME's balance sheet

* If their shorting temporarily suppresses prices, GME can simply buy more B T C at lower prices, strengthening their position even further

**Option B: Stay Short GME, Go Long B T C**

* If they hedge by going long B T C while maintaining GME shorts, they create a bizarre situation where their B T C gains indirectly strengthen the company they're betting against

* Their B T C position becomes a hedge against their GME shorts, essentially nullifying their own thesis

**Option C: Cover GME Shorts**

* The most rational option for short sellers may be to simply admit defeat and cover their positions

* But widespread covering would trigger the squeeze that shorts have been desperately trying to avoid

*""You have no power here!""* \- Lord of the Rings

GameStop has essentially created a closed system where short sellers can't win. If B T C goes up, GME's intrinsic value rises. If B T C temporarily goes down, GME can acquire more at better prices, improving their long-term position.

It's like fighting an opponent who gets stronger whether you hit them or not.

**Level 4: The Nation-State Game - The Global Hash War**

*""Now this is where it gets really interesting...""* \- The Social Network

Beyond corporate strategy, we're witnessing the early stages of what Max Keiser aptly calls the ""Global Hash War"" – a geopolitical competition for B T C influence.

The United States has already established a strategic reserve and is actively seeking budget-neutral ways to acquire more. El Salvador was just the first mover. Other nations are watching closely, knowing that early B T C adoption could reshape the global financial power structure.

What happens when nation-states start competing for the remaining \~2 million un-mined B T C? What happens when central banks begin diversifying reserves away from each other's fiat currencies and into B T C?

**None of this nation-state adoption is priced in.**

For short sellers, this creates an even more terrifying scenario – they're not just betting against GME, B T C enthusiasts, or BlackRock. They're potentially betting against sovereign nations with unlimited fiat printing capability who are incentivized to see B T C succeed.

We are already seeing compelling evidence this is on the verge of happening. The USA has adopted a strategic reserve. The treasury is tasked with finding budget neutral ways to acquire more B T C.

The Lummis introduced bill that is gaining support rapidly would have the US buying 1 million B T C.

There is strong evidence China may already be buying and reliable sources are indicating they are pivoting on their anti-BTC stance for the Chinese Mainland.

Russia is almost certainly mining and buying BTC.

El Salvador and Bhutan have been accumulating B T C via buying and mining.

BRICS nations are beginning to settle global commodity trades in B T C.

The US treasury is considering B T C backed bonds as a way to revamp it's dominance on the global bond market. (NOBODY WANTS TRADITIONAL GOVERNMENT BONDS ANYMORE...that market is dying rapidly).

*""You come at the king, you best not miss.""* \- The Wire

**The Ultimate 4D Chess Move**

By tying its fortunes to B T C, GameStop has created a situation where an increasing number of powerful entities are incentivized to see both B T C and, by extension, GameStop succeed. This creates a powerful network effect and virtuous cycle:

1. GameStop buys B T C

1. This creates buying pressure on B T C

1. B T C price rises, increasing GME's intrinsic value

1. This attracts more B T C-focused investors to GME

1. GME stock rises, allowing it to raise more capital at favorable terms

1. GameStop uses new capital to buy more B T C

1. Repeat

Meanwhile, nation-states, BlackRock, and other institutional players are separately driving adoption, indirectly benefiting GameStop.

For shorts, this isn't just a bad position – it's absolutely existential. They're not just fighting against a company or its retail investors anymore; they're fighting against a global monetary revolution with increasingly powerful allies.

**Why B T C? Explaining B T C to A Golden Retriever**

**""Please, speak as you might to a young child, or a golden retriever"" - Margin Call**

Woof! Hey there buddy! Let's talk about this shiny magic internet money!

Imagine you have a favorite ball. It's the BEST ball. There are only 21 million of these balls in the whole wide world, and no one can make any more! Ever!

Now, some smart computer doggos work really hard to find these balls. They dig and dig (we call this ""mining""). Every time they find a ball, they get to keep it! But it gets harder to find balls over time.

When you have one of these special balls, you can send it to other doggos through the internet! No human needs to help you - it just goes zoom across the internet to your friend!

The reason these balls are so special is because:

1. **Limited Supply**: Only 21 million will ever exist (actually fewer, since some are lost forever like balls under the couch)

1. **Can't Be Faked**: Each ball has a special mark that everyone can check to make sure it's real

1. **No One's In Charge**: There's no big alpha dog who can make more balls or take your balls away

1. **Gets More Valuable Over Time**: As more doggos want these special balls, but there aren't more being made, each ball becomes worth more treats!

Every four years, something magical happens called a ""halving."" The number of new balls that can be found gets cut in half! This makes the balls even more special and rare.

GameStop just bought a whole bunch of these special balls and is keeping them in a super-secure doghouse. This is really smart because:

1. The balls will likely be worth more treats in the future

1. No one can take the balls away from them

1. Other doggos will think GameStop is really cool for having these rare balls

**Escaping the Matrix**

*""You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.""* \- Morpheus

The global financial system is the Matrix. It's a carefully constructed illusion that keeps billions of people plugged in, extracting their time, energy, and value while making them believe they're free.

Fiat currency—digital numbers in a database that can be created at will by the architects of the system—is the ultimate control mechanism. Like the steak that Cypher enjoys, knowing it isn't real, many understand the dollar isn't ""backed"" by anything tangible, yet they choose the comfort of the illusion.

B T C is the red (orange) pill that forces you to confront the uncomfortable truth: your money is being systematically devalued through inflation, the financial agents can change the rules at any moment, and the entire system is built to benefit those closest to the money printer.

**When GameStop takes the red pill by adopting B T C, they're unplugging from a rigged game where market makers, prime brokers, and central banks serve as the sentinels, controlling the flow of liquidity and dictating which companies thrive or die. By holding B T C, they're essentially saying, ""There is no spoon"" to the traditional financial markets—rejecting the fundamental premises that underpin the system.**

For individuals, taking the B T C red pill means recognizing that your bank account isn't what you think it is. The numbers you see represent monetary units whose supply increases by double digits yearly, whose movement can be restricted, and whose very existence depends on third-party permission.

For GameStop as a company, the red pill means acknowledging that playing by Wall Street's rules is a game they can't win. The financial Matrix was programmed with escape hatches only for the privileged.

B T C is the glitch in the Matrix—the anomaly that Neo exploits—allowing both individuals and corporations to exit a system where the house always wins. And just as Neo's awakening threatened the entire Matrix, each entity that unplugs and holds B T C creates fractures in a financial system that requires universal belief to maintain control.

Please do your own research and decide for yourself. But as a GME investor, you have had a unique view of the facade of WallStreet and traditional finance. You know the game is rigged. You know it's a big club, and you ain't in it. You know that you deserve more. And you know that GME deserves better.

*""I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it.""* \- Morpheus

**Where Do We Go From Here?**

GameStop's $1.3 billion convertible note offering is just the beginning. Here's what I expect to see:

1. Immediate deployment of convertible note proceeds into B T C (potentially $1.3+ billion worth)

1. Additional purchases as cash flow allows or another big allocation via cash reserves

1. Further strategic debt offerings at favorable terms to acquire more

1. Development of B T C-related business initiatives (perhaps leveraging their tech and customer base)

1. Potential B T C dividends in the future

The convertible note offering provides an incredible foundation for the next phase of GME's transformation. With five years until maturity, they have ample time to build a B T C position that could dwarf their current market cap.

To all the apes who felt like the GME saga was losing steam - welcome back to the revolution. It just got supercharged with rocket fuel.

**Additional Bullish Catalysts and Musings:**

A certain investor, who is most certainly not a cat, could return. Of course I am talking about him.

Imagine the absolute chaos that would ensue if someone suddenly posted an updated YOLO screenshot showing he's been accumulating this entire time. Or what if he revealed a strategic options position that makes his original GME calls look like pocket change? The man understands leverage and timing better than almost anyone—and with GME now adopting a B T C strategy, there's arguably no better time for him to emerge from the shadows with a reverse uno card that would send shockwaves through Wall Street.

The psychological impact alone would be nuclear.

The resulting FOMO could trigger a buying frenzy that would make January 2021 look like a warmup act. Short sellers, already facing the B T C-driven existential threat we've described, would be caught in a perfect storm.

\- -

**S&P 500 Inclusion: The Institutional Avalanche**

Here's a catalyst almost nobody is talking about: As GameStop continues executing its B T C strategy and the share price appreciates accordingly, the company will eventually cross the threshold for S&P 500 inclusion—triggering one of the most reliable forced-buying events in finance.

The consequences would be massive. Index funds tracking the S&P 500 would be forced to purchase approximately 5-6% of the company's outstanding shares. Active managers benchmarked to the S&P 500 would need to evaluate their positions. This kind of forced buying could create enormous upward pressure on the stock price, especially if the float remains constrained due to high retail ownership.

For short sellers, S&P 500 inclusion would be the final nail in the coffin—passive index buying alone could trigger a significant squeeze event, completely separate from any B T C-related appreciation. The combination of these factors could create a feedback loop where B T C appreciation drives the stock price toward S&P 500 eligibility, which then triggers institutional buying that pushes the price higher, making the B T C position even more valuable.

This is similar to what happened to Tesla when it was added to the S&P 500 and went on a prolonged short squeeze rampage.

This is also what very well could happen later this year with M S T R.

Short term price action and massive short positions...wut doing?

We saw massive amounts of new short positions opened up at the end of this past trading week. In fact, on a share volume basis, the number of shorts opened during this window of time is exceeding 2021 sneeze levels.

What is going on?

It's both simple and complex.

...

**Convertible Bond Hedging Explained For Good Boys**

*Woof! Hello there, good boy! Let's talk about these fancy GME convertible bonds and why the humans who buy them do some tricky things!*

So, imagine you have a special treat token that might turn into many small treats later. These tokens are called ""convertible bonds"" and the big money humans love them!

**Why Humans Hedge Their Treat Tokens:**

When a money human buys GME's convertible bonds, they get a promise: ""Pay $1,000 now, and maybe get GME shares later if the price is high enough!"" The human doesn't want to worry about whether the shares go up or down - they just want a safe, predictable snack.

So what do they do? They buy the convertible bond with one paw, and with the other paw, they ""borrow"" GME shares and sell them right away. Or they don't borrow them and potentially naked short the stock. (BAD DOG!).

**How They Do The Hedge Trick:**

1. Human buys $1,000,000 worth of GME convertible bonds

1. These bonds might convert to about 33,500 GME shares (at the $29.85 conversion price)

1. To stay ""balanced,"" the human immediately shorts (borrows and sells) about 70-80% of those potential shares - maybe 25,000 shares

1. Now they don't care if GME goes up or down - their treat is secure!

**Why They Push The Price Down During Pricing:**

Now here's the sneaky part that would make any good boy confused about human ethics!

During the days when GameStop is deciding how to price these convertible bonds, the humans who want to buy them have a big incentive to make GME's share price go DOWN.

Why? Because if the share price is lower:

1. The conversion price gets set lower

1. Each bond converts into MORE shares later

1. The human gets MORE potential shares for the same money!

So these big money humans might push extra hard on their shorting during this time. They borrow and sell lots of shares, making the price go down right when GameStop is deciding the conversion terms.

It's like pushing other dogs away from the water bowl so you get to drink more.

After the bonds are priced and sold, these humans don't care as much about pushing the price down anymore. They have their bonds, they have their hedge, and they're happy with their balanced position.

*Good news for GME, though! After this initial shorting pressure passes, the price often bounces back up. And with GameStop planning to use that money for B T C, this short pressure might be very temporary before the rocket takes off!*

\-- -

So what I am getting at is this. We saw the stock nose dive during the last few days of trading (important to note the entire market committed Seppuku also). We saw massive new short positions opened up.

I believe two things are happening at once.

1. A bunch of hedging via the bond buyers is happening. This is normal and to be expected. This happens with MSTR all the time. It's actually very bullish because the Bond buyers are on the side of the company and want the price to smash past the conversion premium.

1. Market manipulators and naked short sellers piling onto the trade because they are freaking out.

I believe this because the volume of shorts opening up is greater than what one would typically expect for hedging a position of this size.

1. **Total Convertible Note Offering**: $1.3 billion (potentially $1.5 billion if the option is exercised)

1. **Conversion Price**: $29.85 per share

1. **Conversion Rate**: 33.4970 shares per $1,000 of principal (as stated in the filing)

1. **Total Potential Shares Upon Conversion**:

   * Base offering: $1.3 billion ÷ $1,000 × 33.4970 = 43,546,100 shares

   * With option: $1.5 billion ÷ $1,000 × 33.4970 = 50,245,500 shares

1. **Typical Hedge Ratio**: Convertible arbitrage funds typically hedge between 70-100% of the delta (the sensitivity of the convertible bond to changes in the underlying stock price)

Since these are zero-coupon notes with a 5-year maturity and a 37.5% premium to the current price, the delta would likely be around 75-85%. This is because the conversion option has significant time value but is also meaningfully out-of-the-money.

Applying an 80% hedge ratio (which is typical for investment banks and hedge funds seeking to maximize efficiency):

* Base offering hedge: 43,546,100 shares × 80% = **34,836,880 shares**

* With option hedge: 50,245,500 shares × 80% = **40,196,400 shares**

This means the convertible bond buyers would likely establish new short positions of approximately 35-40 million shares to properly hedge their exposure if they purchased the entire offering.

I need help from other APES who have access to better data to figure out how many new short positions were opened the past few days. I believe it will be significantly in excess of these numbers, which would be atypical for hedging alone.

What happens on Monday and Tuesday this coming week will also be telling. If we see continuing massive shorts being opened well beyond these numbers, they are almost certainly new naked shorts piling into this moment of time to suppress the price further and try to delay the inevitable reckoning to come.

**In Conclusion. 5-D Chess Not Checkers**

What RC and the GameStop board have done is nothing short of revolutionary. They've taken the playbook of the best-performing stock of the last four years (M S T R) and applied it to a company that already had significant speculative interest and short pressure.

The result will be explosive. We're not just talking about a short squeeze anymore; we're talking about a fundamental revaluation of what GameStop represents as a company.

If B T C performs as it has historically, by 2030 the value of the B T C purchased could far exceed the principal amount of the notes. If the stock price rises above the conversion threshold, the notes convert into equity at an already premium price. This ""dilution"" will mean very little to shareholder value when it converts, because it's truly accretive. GME is going to use it's ability to raise cheap/free convertible debt and it's cash flow, and it's cash stockpiles, to accrete more and more shareholder value by stacking B T C.

This is not financial advice. I'm not telling you to buy GME or B T C. I'm just observing what could be one of the most fascinating corporate transformations of our lifetime

But as for me, I like the stock.

Remember: ""When someone tries to buy all the world's supply of a scarce asset, the more they buy the higher the price goes."" - Satoshi Nakamoto

*Mic drop*

P.S. April 1, 2030 is the maturity date of the notes. April Fools' Day. RC has a sense of humor. But the joke's gonna be on the shorts.

It Happened! **TLDR: GameStop has officially adopted a B T C playbook, and holy crap, it's actually happening. They've announced a $1.3 BILLION convertible note offering specifically mentioning B T C acquisition as the intended use of proceeds. This is the first phase of a multi-decade transformation that leaves short sellers in shambles, rocket shareholder value to Uranus, and position GME as a financial revolutionary in an increasingly digital world.**

*Explosion emoji intensifies*

*Bewilderment intensifies.*

For those who read my post from a few months back where I outlined how GME could nuke shorts by adopting B T C as a treasury asset, following MSTR's playbook...

Well, apes, it's time to abandon the tinfoil hats because it's happening. **They actually did it.**

GameStop has gone full gigachad with a $1.3 BILLION convertible note offering explicitly mentioning B T C acquisition.

**Here's my post from a few months ago on this sub.**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ikq1en/gme\_and\_plan\_b/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ikq1en/gme_and_plan_b/)

**If you haven't been following the news, GameStop has just announced they're adopting a B T C treasury strategy, joining the ranks of MicroStrategy and other forward-thinking companies that understand we're living through the early days of a monetary revolution.**

I've been glued to my screen since this announcement dropped, watching as the market reaction plays out. But this isn't about immediate and short-term price action. This is about a fundamental realignment of GameStop's value proposition that will play out over years, not days - and the convertible note offering is rocket fuel for what's to come.

**The Announcement That Changes Everything**

The press release doesn't mince words. GameStop has announced:

1. A $1.3 BILLION convertible note offering (with potential for an additional $200 million)

1. 0.00% interest rate - yes, you read that right, ZERO PERCENT

1. Explicitly stated the proceeds would be used for ""general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of B T C in a manner consistent with GameStop's Investment Policy.""

1. Notes mature on April 1, 2030 (five years from now)

1. Initial conversion price of $29.85 (37.5% premium over current price)

This is straight out of the M S T R playbook.

For years, the traditional financial system has convinced retail investors that they have a fair shot in the markets. But as GME apes discovered, the game is rigged. The spoon bends when market makers and prime brokers want it to. The timing of GME's B T C strategy announcement is not coincidental - it's strategic.

**The Playbook: GME Edition**

What GameStop is doing follows the exact blueprint that Michael Saylor laid out with M S T R, and they're executing it masterfully. Let me break down what's happening and what I think is coming next.

**Phase 1: Initial Allocation** (HAPPENING NOW)

* $1.3 billion from convertible notes to be deployed for B T C acquisition

* Potential additional $200 million if option is exercised

* This immediately establishes GME as a significant holder

**Phase 2: Establish the Flywheel** (COMING SOON)

* As B T C price rises, GME's stock gains a premium

* Market sentiment shifts from ""struggling retailer"" to "" B T C proxy with retail upside and a profitable core business""

* Short sellers begin feeling pain as their thesis becomes obsolete

**Phase 3: Leverage the Premium** (FUTURE)

* Issue more debt at favorable terms

* Use proceeds to acquire more

* Rinse and repeat, creating a virtuous cycle that squeezes shorts

Let's look closer at this convertible note offering - it's pure financial wizardry. Zero percent interest means they're borrowing $1.3 billion with NO INTEREST PAYMENTS. The notes mature in 2030, by which time B T C will likely have gone through another 1-2 halving cycles and appreciated significantly.

The conversion price of $29.85 represents a 37.5% premium over the current stock price. If the stock stays below that price, GameStop keeps the $1.3 billion to stack more B T C. If the stock rises above that level (which is likely given their new strategy), the notes convert to shares at a price that's already at a premium.

**The Numbers**

Let's run some projections based on GameStop's convertible note offering and the current B T C price of $82,700:

Convertible note proceeds: $1.3 billion (potentially $1.5 billion with the extra option)

At current B T C prices: $1.3 billion ÷ $82,700 = \~15,720 BTC (or up to \~18,138 BTC if the additional $200 million option is exercised)

This would immediately make GameStop one of the largest corporate holders in the world.

* Outstanding shares: roughly 450,000,000 shares

* Convertible notes: $1.3 billion at a conversion price of $29.85 per share

* Potential additional shares from conversion: $1.3 billion ÷ $29.85 = \~43,551,088 shares

* Total potential fully diluted shares: \~493,551,088

Let's run some numbers based on various B T C price projections:

**Conservative Case ($150,000 B T C by 2026)**:

* 15,720 BTC × $150,000 = $2.36 billion

* Per share value contribution: \~$5.24 (based on 450M shares) or \~$4.78 (fully diluted)

**Base Case ($500,000 B T C by 2028)**:

* 15,720 BTC × $500,000 = $7.86 billion

* Per share value contribution: \~$17.47 (based on 450M shares) or \~$15.93 (fully diluted)

**Bullish Case ($1,000,000 B T C by 2030)**:

* 15,720 BTC × $1,000,000 = $15.72 billion

* Per share value contribution: \~$34.93 (based on 450M shares) or \~$31.85 (fully diluted)

But here's the kicker - B T C treasury companies typically trade at a premium to their holdings. M S T R has traded anywhere from 1.2x to 3x its holdings.

**Applying a modest 2x premium:**

* Conservative case: \~$10.48 per share (or \~$9.56 fully diluted)

* Base case: \~$34.94 per share (or \~$31.86 fully diluted)

* Bullish case: \~$69.86 per share (or \~$63.70 fully diluted)

And the beautiful part? The notes mature in 2030, right when B T C might be reaching that bullish case according to many analysts. The timing couldn't be more perfect.

**Beyond The Initial Raise: The Big Picture Projections**

Let's take this a step further. GameStop currently has over $4 billion in cash on its balance sheet in addition to this $1.3 billion convertible offering. What if they go all-in on the B T C strategy like M S T R did?

Let's project what happens if GameStop deploys a total of $6 billion into B T C over time (using their existing cash plus the convertible notes):

At an average purchase price between $82,700 and $100,000: $6 billion ÷ $90,000 (average) = \~66,667 B T C

Now let's apply the original post's ARR (Annual Rate of Return) projections with the updated share count:

* Outstanding shares: 450,000,000 shares

* Potential shares from full conversion: \~43,551,088 shares

* Total potential fully diluted shares: \~493,551,088

**Bearish Case (12% ARR):**

* Starting value in 2025: $6,000,000,000

* 2035 Value = $6,000,000,000 \* (1 + 0.12)\^10 = $18,635,099,969

* 2045 Value = $6,000,000,000 \* (1 + 0.12)\^20 = $57,916,123,317

**Base Case (27% ARR):**

* Starting value in 2025: $6,000,000,000

* 2035 Value = $6,000,000,000 \* (1 + 0.27)\^10 = $69,473,249,781

* 2045 Value = $6,000,000,000 \* (1 + 0.27)\^20 = $798,331,160,152

**Bullish Case (37% ARR):**

* Starting value in 2025: $6,000,000,000

* 2035 Value = $6,000,000,000 \* (1 + 0.37)\^10 = $145,486,361,781

* 2045 Value = $6,000,000,000 \* (1 + 0.37)\^20 = $3,518,980,996,027

**What would this mean for the stock price by 2035?**

**Bearish Case:**

* B T C value per share: $41.41 (based on 450M shares) or $37.76 (fully diluted)

* With 2x premium: $82.82 or $75.52 fully diluted (302% increase from current price)

**Base Case:**

* B T C value per share: $154.38 (based on 450M shares) or $140.76 (fully diluted)

* With 2x premium: $308.76 or $281.52 fully diluted (1,126% increase from current price)

**Bullish Case:**

* B T C value per share: $323.30 (based on 450M shares) or $294.78 (fully diluted)

* With 2x premium: $646.60 or $589.56 fully diluted (2,358% increase from current price)

**And by 2045?**

**Bearish Case:**

* B T C value per share: $128.70 (based on 450M shares) or $117.35 (fully diluted)

* With 2x premium: $257.40 or $234.70 fully diluted (939% increase from current price)

**Base Case:**

* B T C value per share: $1,774.07 (based on 450M shares) or $1,617.52 (fully diluted)

* With 2x premium: $3,548.14 or $3,235.04 fully diluted (12,940% increase from current price)

**Bullish Case:**

* B T C value per share: $7,820.00 (based on 450M shares) or $7,130.02 (fully diluted)

* With 2x premium: $15,640.00 or $14,260.04 fully diluted (57,056% increase from current price)

\*""\*If you aren't first you're last"" -Ricky Bobby

These projections are derived from B T C actual historical performance. And remember, these are just based on holdings - they don't include any value from GameStop's core business or future innovations.

They are also sand-bagged. Like...a lot.

Consider that most stocks in the Tech space trade at Price to Earnings ratios of 25-30. Right now it's so early in the BTC treasury game, and BTC bears are debating why a company holding BTC like M S T R should even trade above it's intrinsic value.

I think this thesis will die in the next few years as it becomes clear you can convert B T C holdings into straight earnings because of B T C performance and because of being able to leverage it in ways that M S T R is just now starting to reveal (things like STRK and STRF, going after huge markets like fixed income).

There will be a MASSIVE advantage to the few companies that accumulate huge stacks of B T C at these prices, because soon nobody will be able to buy anywhere close to this amount without sending the B T C price to the moon.

There is simply not enough of it available.

Once we get a few more years into this financial revolution, and nation states and MAG-7 companies are involved, companies like M S T R and GME who have massive stacks, are going to hit escape velocity from everyone else.

That's the advantage of being the first significant sized company with a lot of assets to adopt the M S T R playbook.

The NAV premium will grow...a lot. Imagine GME and M S T R trading at 5-15x NAV premium in 10 years, instead of 2. I very much think that is in play.

Also...there's the whole giant elephant in the room. If there are in fact massive short positions still in play that are hidden (I think this is the case), these prices absolutely do not reflect the face melting volatility and short squeeze/gamma squeeze events that will ensue.

AND. GME can continue to raise convertible debt funds to buy more and more B T C beyond their cash reserves if they so choose. Their stack could be substantially larger than these projections.

**The Perfect Storm for Shorts**

If you thought the original GME squeeze was intense, you ain't seen nothing yet. The new strategy creates a multi-layer trap for short sellers, and the convertible note offering just added rocket fuel:

1. **Immediate Pressure**: As market sentiment shifts, risk models for shorting GME change dramatically. With $1.3 billion in new capital targeting B T C, the risk profile for shorts just exploded.

1. **Medium-Term Squeeze**: As B T C price rises during this halving cycle, GME's underlying value increases, forcing periodic covering. Each B T C price milestone becomes a pain point for shorts.

1. **Long-Term Obliteration**: The flywheel effect of B T C appreciation → premium valuation → debt/equity issuance → more B T C acquisition becomes a death spiral for short positions.

With B T C currently trading at $82,700 and still in the early stages of its post-halving bull run, the timer is ticking for anyone holding short positions. It has historically seen its most dramatic price appreciation in the 12-18 months following a halving - we're right in that window now.

It's also not yet clear that we will see a dramatic violent prolonged bear market as in the past, now that the bid for B T C has shifted from retail to institutional capital and soon...nation states.

**The Hidden Short Positions**

Remember all those theories about massive hidden short positions through total return swaps, married puts, and other exotic instruments?

Those positions are now in serious jeopardy.

If GME was truly shorted multiple times over the float (as many including myself believe), those positions suddenly face a new reality: their collateral is now competing against an asset with a 44-46% compound annual growth rate over the last decade. And now, GameStop has just secured $1.3 billion to acquire this asset. And is sitting on another 4+ billion dollars of cash to acquire even more!

*""What we've got here is... failure to communicate.""* \- Cool Hand Luke

Shorts are about to learn an expensive lesson. Let me explain why this convertible note offering is particularly brutal for shorts:

1. **Zero Percent Interest** \- GameStop is borrowing $1.3 billion and paying NO interest. This means they can hold this capital indefinitely without bleeding cash.

1. **Conversion Premium** \- The notes convert at $29.85 per share, which is 37.5% above the current price. If the stock stays below this level, shorts might feel safe, but they're sitting under a sword of Damocles.

1. **Long Duration** \- The notes mature in 2030, giving GameStop five years to execute their strategy through at least one more halving cycle.

1. **Bear Trap** \- If shorts try to suppress the stock below the conversion price, they're actually helping GameStop acquire more B T C with less dilution - strengthening the company long-term.

**The Game Theory Masterclass: Checkmate in Four Moves**

*""In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces.""* \- Zapp Brannigan, Futurama

Let's talk about what's really happening here from a game theory perspective, because the strategic implications of GME's new play are absolutely mindblowing.

**Level 1: The Investor Base Transformation**

By adopting B T C as a treasury strategy, GameStop isn't just buying a digital asset – they're completely transforming their investor base. Suddenly, GameStop becomes attractive to:

1. B T C-focused hedge funds and family offices

1. Tech-forward institutional investors

1. B T C whales looking for stock market exposure

1. ETF providers seeking correlated equities

1. Momentum traders who follow B T C trends

This is a completely different investor profile than the traditional GameStop investor. These new players have deeper pockets, tend to have longer time horizons, and are accustomed to B T C volatility.

*""The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.""* \- Sun Tzu

**Level 2: The BlackRock Alliance**

Here's where it gets spicy. By aligning with B T C, GameStop has indirectly aligned itself with the world's largest asset manager – BlackRock – which now manages the I B I T, ETF. This isn't just any ETF; it's the fastest-growing ETF launch in financial history.

BlackRock has trillions of dollars under management and unparalleled influence across global capital markets. They don't lose battles they choose to fight. By implementing a B T C treasury strategy, GameStop has essentially recruited a financial behemoth as an ally.

This creates an asymmetric battlefield where the shorts, who may have had advantages in traditional markets, suddenly find themselves fighting against not just retail investors, but the combined might of the B T C community and institutional giants like BlackRock.

**Level 3: The Short Seller's Dilemma - Welcome to the TerrorDome**

*""Now you're in a whole new kind of trouble, aren't you?""* \- John Wick

Short sellers now face an impossible dilemma:

**Option A: Stay Short GME, Short B T C**

* If they double down by shorting both GME and B T C, they risk catastrophic losses if B T C continues its post-halving surge

* Every B T C price increase directly strengthens GME's balance sheet

* If their shorting temporarily suppresses prices, GME can simply buy more B T C at lower prices, strengthening their position even further

**Option B: Stay Short GME, Go Long B T C**

* If they hedge by going long B T C while maintaining GME shorts, they create a bizarre situation where their B T C gains indirectly strengthen the company they're betting against

* Their B T C position becomes a hedge against their GME shorts, essentially nullifying their own thesis

**Option C: Cover GME Shorts**

* The most rational option for short sellers may be to simply admit defeat and cover their positions

* But widespread covering would trigger the squeeze that shorts have been desperately trying to avoid

*""You have no power here!""* \- Lord of the Rings

GameStop has essentially created a closed system where short sellers can't win. If B T C goes up, GME's intrinsic value rises. If B T C temporarily goes down, GME can acquire more at better prices, improving their long-term position.

It's like fighting an opponent who gets stronger whether you hit them or not.

**Level 4: The Nation-State Game - The Global Hash War**

*""Now this is where it gets really interesting...""* \- The Social Network

Beyond corporate strategy, we're witnessing the early stages of what Max Keiser aptly calls the ""Global Hash War"" – a geopolitical competition for B T C influence.

The United States has already established a strategic reserve and is actively seeking budget-neutral ways to acquire more. El Salvador was just the first mover. Other nations are watching closely, knowing that early B T C adoption could reshape the global financial power structure.

What happens when nation-states start competing for the remaining \~2 million un-mined B T C? What happens when central banks begin diversifying reserves away from each other's fiat currencies and into B T C?

**None of this nation-state adoption is priced in.**

For short sellers, this creates an even more terrifying scenario – they're not just betting against GME, B T C enthusiasts, or BlackRock. They're potentially betting against sovereign nations with unlimited fiat printing capability who are incentivized to see B T C succeed.

We are already seeing compelling evidence this is on the verge of happening. The USA has adopted a strategic reserve. The treasury is tasked with finding budget neutral ways to acquire more B T C.

The Lummis introduced bill that is gaining support rapidly would have the US buying 1 million B T C.

There is strong evidence China may already be buying and reliable sources are indicating they are pivoting on their anti-BTC stance for the Chinese Mainland.

Russia is almost certainly mining and buying BTC.

El Salvador and Bhutan have been accumulating B T C via buying and mining.

BRICS nations are beginning to settle global commodity trades in B T C.

The US treasury is considering B T C backed bonds as a way to revamp it's dominance on the global bond market. (NOBODY WANTS TRADITIONAL GOVERNMENT BONDS ANYMORE...that market is dying rapidly).

*""You come at the king, you best not miss.""* \- The Wire

**The Ultimate 4D Chess Move**

By tying its fortunes to B T C, GameStop has created a situation where an increasing number of powerful entities are incentivized to see both B T C and, by extension, GameStop succeed. This creates a powerful network effect and virtuous cycle:

1. GameStop buys B T C

1. This creates buying pressure on B T C

1. B T C price rises, increasing GME's intrinsic value

1. This attracts more B T C-focused investors to GME

1. GME stock rises, allowing it to raise more capital at favorable terms

1. GameStop uses new capital to buy more B T C

1. Repeat

Meanwhile, nation-states, BlackRock, and other institutional players are separately driving adoption, indirectly benefiting GameStop.

For shorts, this isn't just a bad position – it's absolutely existential. They're not just fighting against a company or its retail investors anymore; they're fighting against a global monetary revolution with increasingly powerful allies.

**Why B T C? Explaining B T C to A Golden Retriever**

**""Please, speak as you might to a young child, or a golden retriever"" - Margin Call**

Woof! Hey there buddy! Let's talk about this shiny magic internet money!

Imagine you have a favorite ball. It's the BEST ball. There are only 21 million of these balls in the whole wide world, and no one can make any more! Ever!

Now, some smart computer doggos work really hard to find these balls. They dig and dig (we call this ""mining""). Every time they find a ball, they get to keep it! But it gets harder to find balls over time.

When you have one of these special balls, you can send it to other doggos through the internet! No human needs to help you - it just goes zoom across the internet to your friend!

The reason these balls are so special is because:

1. **Limited Supply**: Only 21 million will ever exist (actually fewer, since some are lost forever like balls under the couch)

1. **Can't Be Faked**: Each ball has a special mark that everyone can check to make sure it's real

1. **No One's In Charge**: There's no big alpha dog who can make more balls or take your balls away

1. **Gets More Valuable Over Time**: As more doggos want these special balls, but there aren't more being made, each ball becomes worth more treats!

Every four years, something magical happens called a ""halving."" The number of new balls that can be found gets cut in half! This makes the balls even more special and rare.

GameStop just bought a whole bunch of these special balls and is keeping them in a super-secure doghouse. This is really smart because:

1. The balls will likely be worth more treats in the future

1. No one can take the balls away from them

1. Other doggos will think GameStop is really cool for having these rare balls

**Escaping the Matrix**

*""You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.""* \- Morpheus

The global financial system is the Matrix. It's a carefully constructed illusion that keeps billions of people plugged in, extracting their time, energy, and value while making them believe they're free.

Fiat currency—digital numbers in a database that can be created at will by the architects of the system—is the ultimate control mechanism. Like the steak that Cypher enjoys, knowing it isn't real, many understand the dollar isn't ""backed"" by anything tangible, yet they choose the comfort of the illusion.

B T C is the red (orange) pill that forces you to confront the uncomfortable truth: your money is being systematically devalued through inflation, the financial agents can change the rules at any moment, and the entire system is built to benefit those closest to the money printer.

**When GameStop takes the red pill by adopting B T C, they're unplugging from a rigged game where market makers, prime brokers, and central banks serve as the sentinels, controlling the flow of liquidity and dictating which companies thrive or die. By holding B T C, they're essentially saying, ""There is no spoon"" to the traditional financial markets—rejecting the fundamental premises that underpin the system.**

For individuals, taking the B T C red pill means recognizing that your bank account isn't what you think it is. The numbers you see represent monetary units whose supply increases by double digits yearly, whose movement can be restricted, and whose very existence depends on third-party permission.

For GameStop as a company, the red pill means acknowledging that playing by Wall Street's rules is a game they can't win. The financial Matrix was programmed with escape hatches only for the privileged.

B T C is the glitch in the Matrix—the anomaly that Neo exploits—allowing both individuals and corporations to exit a system where the house always wins. And just as Neo's awakening threatened the entire Matrix, each entity that unplugs and holds B T C creates fractures in a financial system that requires universal belief to maintain control.

Please do your own research and decide for yourself. But as a GME investor, you have had a unique view of the facade of WallStreet and traditional finance. You know the game is rigged. You know it's a big club, and you ain't in it. You know that you deserve more. And you know that GME deserves better.

*""I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it.""* \- Morpheus

**Where Do We Go From Here?**

GameStop's $1.3 billion convertible note offering is just the beginning. Here's what I expect to see:

1. Immediate deployment of convertible note proceeds into B T C (potentially $1.3+ billion worth)

1. Additional purchases as cash flow allows or another big allocation via cash reserves

1. Further strategic debt offerings at favorable terms to acquire more

1. Development of B T C-related business initiatives (perhaps leveraging their tech and customer base)

1. Potential B T C dividends in the future

The convertible note offering provides an incredible foundation for the next phase of GME's transformation. With five years until maturity, they have ample time to build a B T C position that could dwarf their current market cap.

To all the apes who felt like the GME saga was losing steam - welcome back to the revolution. It just got supercharged with rocket fuel.

**Additional Bullish Catalysts and Musings:**

A certain investor, who is most certainly not a cat, could return. Of course I am talking about him.

Imagine the absolute chaos that would ensue if someone suddenly posted an updated YOLO screenshot showing he's been accumulating this entire time. Or what if he revealed a strategic options position that makes his original GME calls look like pocket change? The man understands leverage and timing better than almost anyone—and with GME now adopting a B T C strategy, there's arguably no better time for him to emerge from the shadows with a reverse uno card that would send shockwaves through Wall Street.

The psychological impact alone would be nuclear.

The resulting FOMO could trigger a buying frenzy that would make January 2021 look like a warmup act. Short sellers, already facing the B T C-driven existential threat we've described, would be caught in a perfect storm.

\- -

**S&P 500 Inclusion: The Institutional Avalanche**

Here's a catalyst almost nobody is talking about: As GameStop continues executing its B T C strategy and the share price appreciates accordingly, the company will eventually cross the threshold for S&P 500 inclusion—triggering one of the most reliable forced-buying events in finance.

The consequences would be massive. Index funds tracking the S&P 500 would be forced to purchase approximately 5-6% of the company's outstanding shares. Active managers benchmarked to the S&P 500 would need to evaluate their positions. This kind of forced buying could create enormous upward pressure on the stock price, especially if the float remains constrained due to high retail ownership.

For short sellers, S&P 500 inclusion would be the final nail in the coffin—passive index buying alone could trigger a significant squeeze event, completely separate from any B T C-related appreciation. The combination of these factors could create a feedback loop where B T C appreciation drives the stock price toward S&P 500 eligibility, which then triggers institutional buying that pushes the price higher, making the B T C position even more valuable.

This is similar to what happened to Tesla when it was added to the S&P 500 and went on a prolonged short squeeze rampage.

This is also what very well could happen later this year with M S T R.

Short term price action and massive short positions...wut doing?

We saw massive amounts of new short positions opened up at the end of this past trading week. In fact, on a share volume basis, the number of shorts opened during this window of time is exceeding 2021 sneeze levels.

What is going on?

It's both simple and complex.

...

**Convertible Bond Hedging Explained For Good Boys**

*Woof! Hello there, good boy! Let's talk about these fancy GME convertible bonds and why the humans who buy them do some tricky things!*

So, imagine you have a special treat token that might turn into many small treats later. These tokens are called ""convertible bonds"" and the big money humans love them!

**Why Humans Hedge Their Treat Tokens:**

When a money human buys GME's convertible bonds, they get a promise: ""Pay $1,000 now, and maybe get GME shares later if the price is high enough!"" The human doesn't want to worry about whether the shares go up or down - they just want a safe, predictable snack.

So what do they do? They buy the convertible bond with one paw, and with the other paw, they ""borrow"" GME shares and sell them right away. Or they don't borrow them and potentially naked short the stock. (BAD DOG!).

**How They Do The Hedge Trick:**

1. Human buys $1,000,000 worth of GME convertible bonds

1. These bonds might convert to about 33,500 GME shares (at the $29.85 conversion price)

1. To stay ""balanced,"" the human immediately shorts (borrows and sells) about 70-80% of those potential shares - maybe 25,000 shares

1. Now they don't care if GME goes up or down - their treat is secure!

**Why They Push The Price Down During Pricing:**

Now here's the sneaky part that would make any good boy confused about human ethics!

During the days when GameStop is deciding how to price these convertible bonds, the humans who want to buy them have a big incentive to make GME's share price go DOWN.

Why? Because if the share price is lower:

1. The conversion price gets set lower

1. Each bond converts into MORE shares later

1. The human gets MORE potential shares for the same money!

So these big money humans might push extra hard on their shorting during this time. They borrow and sell lots of shares, making the price go down right when GameStop is deciding the conversion terms.

It's like pushing other dogs away from the water bowl so you get to drink more.

After the bonds are priced and sold, these humans don't care as much about pushing the price down anymore. They have their bonds, they have their hedge, and they're happy with their balanced position.

*Good news for GME, though! After this initial shorting pressure passes, the price often bounces back up. And with GameStop planning to use that money for B T C, this short pressure might be very temporary before the rocket takes off!*

\-- -

So what I am getting at is this. We saw the stock nose dive during the last few days of trading (important to note the entire market committed Seppuku also). We saw massive new short positions opened up.

I believe two things are happening at once.

1. A bunch of hedging via the bond buyers is happening. This is normal and to be expected. This happens with MSTR all the time. It's actually very bullish because the Bond buyers are on the side of the company and want the price to smash past the conversion premium.

1. Market manipulators and naked short sellers piling onto the trade because they are freaking out.

I believe this because the volume of shorts opening up is greater than what one would typically expect for hedging a position of this size.

1. **Total Convertible Note Offering**: $1.3 billion (potentially $1.5 billion if the option is exercised)

1. **Conversion Price**: $29.85 per share

1. **Conversion Rate**: 33.4970 shares per $1,000 of principal (as stated in the filing)

1. **Total Potential Shares Upon Conversion**:

   * Base offering: $1.3 billion ÷ $1,000 × 33.4970 = 43,546,100 shares

   * With option: $1.5 billion ÷ $1,000 × 33.4970 = 50,245,500 shares

1. **Typical Hedge Ratio**: Convertible arbitrage funds typically hedge between 70-100% of the delta (the sensitivity of the convertible bond to changes in the underlying stock price)

Since these are zero-coupon notes with a 5-year maturity and a 37.5% premium to the current price, the delta would likely be around 75-85%. This is because the conversion option has significant time value but is also meaningfully out-of-the-money.

Applying an 80% hedge ratio (which is typical for investment banks and hedge funds seeking to maximize efficiency):

* Base offering hedge: 43,546,100 shares × 80% = **34,836,880 shares**

* With option hedge: 50,245,500 shares × 80% = **40,196,400 shares**

This means the convertible bond buyers would likely establish new short positions of approximately 35-40 million shares to properly hedge their exposure if they purchased the entire offering.

I need help from other APES who have access to better data to figure out how many new short positions were opened the past few days. I believe it will be significantly in excess of these numbers, which would be atypical for hedging alone.

What happens on Monday and Tuesday this coming week will also be telling. If we see continuing massive shorts being opened well beyond these numbers, they are almost certainly new naked shorts piling into this moment of time to suppress the price further and try to delay the inevitable reckoning to come.

**In Conclusion. 5-D Chess Not Checkers**

What RC and the GameStop board have done is nothing short of revolutionary. They've taken the playbook of the best-performing stock of the last four years (M S T R) and applied it to a company that already had significant speculative interest and short pressure.

The result will be explosive. We're not just talking about a short squeeze anymore; we're talking about a fundamental revaluation of what GameStop represents as a company.

If B T C performs as it has historically, by 2030 the value of the B T C purchased could far exceed the principal amount of the notes. If the stock price rises above the conversion threshold, the notes convert into equity at an already premium price. This ""dilution"" will mean very little to shareholder value when it converts, because it's truly accretive. GME is going to use it's ability to raise cheap/free convertible debt and it's cash flow, and it's cash stockpiles, to accrete more and more shareholder value by stacking B T C.

This is not financial advice. I'm not telling you to buy GME or B T C. I'm just observing what could be one of the most fascinating corporate transformations of our lifetime

But as for me, I like the stock.

Remember: ""When someone tries to buy all the world's supply of a scarce asset, the more they buy the higher the price goes."" - Satoshi Nakamoto

*Mic drop*

P.S. April 1, 2030 is the maturity date of the notes. April Fools' Day. RC has a sense of humor. But the joke's gonna be on the shorts.

I (33F) and my husband (37M) were having a discussion about politics and we got onto the topic of our daughter (7F) which led to me expressing my fears about her rights and bodily autonomy.



*For context, my husband votes Republican and I have always considered myself independent but recently have been shifting very far away from my younger “carefree” attitude toward politics. I love him very much and I know for a fact that he loves me but I have started finding his opinions naive and lacking depth. He is a very good man though and has in the past changed his mind on several things when confronted with them.* 



*FURTHER context: my cousin lives in a strict anti-abortion state and almost died a few years ago when the doctors waited until she was actively dying of sepsis before they decided it was okay to remove the dead baby from her body even though it had been dead for weeks beforehand (so needless to say I had a wake-up call and sharpened up my principles until they are very shiny and pointy)*



Last night when we were talking about abortion rights being healthcare, I lost my composure out of sheer terror about the possibility of a similar disaster with my cousin happening to our daughter and how I struggle to understand how he doesn’t see the problem with his party and that in fact I think he is being willfully ignorant to the danger I and my daughter face in favor of his idea about making economics work for our family. I also said that if our daughter dies due to something preventable, like the ability to get a timely and much needed abortion, or gets shot to death in school that I would let my own mother rot in a nursing home (she votes R too) and I’d never be able to look him in the face again which would basically be me disappearing and divorcing him.



I was crying and upset and explaining how scared I was and he asked me in a very hurt manner if I’d actually abandon him like that I am truthful to a fault and said that I would, perhaps out of a sense of illogical grief and betrayal, because I’d know my concerns were not taken seriously and that they had abandoned common sense and did nothing to attempt preventing a very real consequence of voting away mine and my daughter’s right to healthcare. I equated it to a slow motion car wreck with our daughter in mortal danger and him just watching it happen bc it doesn’t involve his own body.



I know he needs to hear it. But I think I was too raw and open about it to steer the conversation in a healthy way and I have a very blunt manner. I apologized this morning for saying that I’d leave him, even though I knew I would, and he tentatively accepted it. And I said we’d talk about things later when I can articulate things in a healthier way. But I’m at a loss as to how to make it known how deadly serious this is to me and not make him feel like I’d abandon our marriage over just any sensitive topic.



I do not need people telling me to leave him. I don’t think I know how to make it any more digestible and be clear without going nuclear over something that has not happened as our daughter is too young to suffer that yet. The rub is that I am the person who is changing the dynamic of our relationship. And I am beginning to understand how politics breaks up families.

  
***Relevant Comments***:

  
**PrincessNopal**:

>Ask him to name scenarios that he would accept the premature death of his daughter. Ask him to name what life saving healthcare he would be willing to deny for his daughter based on principles. If he can’t name any, ask him why is abortion different. Use your cousin’s story as a hypothetical for your daughter but be as graphic with it as you can be. But in all honesty, if you must labor so much to convince him to care about yours and your daughter’s health and well-being, then this should also serve as a wake up call to you. And if I were you, I’d take back your apology. You meant what you said and only apologized to comfort him. I say let him be uncomfortable. Why are you so concerned with the bluntness of your words and not concerned about how quick he is to dismiss you?

  
**owltower22**:

>I’m the daughter of a republican dad and liberal mom. I’m honestly not sure why they are still together, and think it is because they are older and retired. Luckily I live in a liberal state that doesn’t take away human rights, so I think it allows my mom not to think about it as much. It’s been since trump that I’ve really seen the division between them.  


>I don’t really have any advice to give you, but the perspective from a daughter in a similar type of situation. I love my dad, but I don’t have a lot of respect for him because I don’t think he actually understands what’s going on. It hurts as a daughter to know my dad votes for a party that is actively doing bad to a lot of human rights mainly because he believes in the economics of republicans. I also hate having to be around my parents in the evening, specially if they are watching the news. My mom definitely holds frustration for my dad and takes it out by saying mean things to him. And I feel like my dad doesn’t take it seriously, because I don’t think he actually understands how scary this is for certain people. I wish my parents would do therapy together, and honestly you guys should probably do therapy together if you actually want to make your marriage work without resentment growing.

**Ysadey**:

>I understand why you don't want advice to leave him, but you may have to accept that as your reality simply because your morals, values, and ethics are no longer compatible. But of course, do everything you can to try to reach him. Obviously, deep down, you know him and know he has the potential.   
  
>I went through this with my own husband years ago. And I wasn't nice about it. It was pretty much a deal breaker for me then, and now, and he was too busy being smugly libertarian on every other issue, so I had nothing to lose. That said, once he extracted his head from his rectum, I've been happy to explain things from my perspective as long as he's willing to actually listen. He's not perfect, but he gets a lot that men generally don't or take for granted.  


>I do know that one of my big points was that his views meant I couldn't trust him. Women's reproductive rights sure don't affect men directly, but by not caring about the issue because they care about the women in their life, they are sending a clear message that women are interchangeable appliances. He either cares about the things that are important to you or he doesn't actually care about you. He can't claim to love and respect you and want a future with you if he's voting against your basic interests.  


>That is hurtful for you, but you are allowing him to center his feeling hurt because you threatened to divorce him someday. He's hurting you now, but he wants to focus on his potential future pain that would be a direct consequence of his behavior now. Let that sink in.  


>He is telling you exactly where you stand with him in multiple ways.  


>Further, he's deluded if he thinks voting for Trump/Republicans is going to actually be good for his finances. Maybe in the short term. The reality is that any gains he makes will be offset by the tax overhaul and tarrif system. If your wealth is dependent on your income in any significant way, Trump winning would put your income at risk as women are forced out of the workplace and into a housewife role. If your income depends on either of you working overtime, Trump is giving employers a way to deny overtime premiums through creative scheduling. A lot of tex deductions and credits that primarily benefit low- and middle-class families are being eliminated while those that benefit the wealthiest are left intact or strengthened. We've already had a preview of his roided out trickle-down economy from his first term. Your husband is being incredibly short-sighted.

>However, the harsh reality is, that this situation? That is your present and your future, as long as you stick with ""republican"" men. He is not a ""very good man"" when he puts your, your daughter's and every other woman's life at risk by voting for people who want nothing but destruction and power. That doesn't change, no matter how much you gaslight yourself that you can somehow ""fix him"" or see reason. Sorry to be so blunt about it.

>OP, you think you can fix your partner. You cannot. Nobody can fix another person. You can’t “be the person who is changing the dynamic of \[the\] relationship” when you’re not the bad actor. You should not have to explain why rolling back women’s rights is fucked up to get someone to see that, he already knows and DOES NOT CARE.

Thank you to all who commented.



UPDATE: We had a serious discussion. I went into more detail about my concerns and fears and it was… intense. I was much better at presenting the case. I gave him several hypotheticals that involved a particularly gruesome set of circumstances involving his ballsac ( 😬). I won’t bore you with the nitty gritty but the gist was to shift his perspective. I told him to seriously consider carrying a tiny fetus in his ball sac and the fact that the risks were things like Exploding Balls, Sepsis, etc, and the myriad of ways he could end up dead, permanently physically injured and disfigured, or unable to produce a fetus in the future if he didn’t have the option of removing the fetus from his ballsac. I asked him if he would even want to take the risk and he agreed that he’d be very likely to remove it unless he was ready for those risks. I asked him why in the world would I be justified in telling him he HAS to carry it no matter what and it m*ight* only be removed after it starts to explode out of his ballsac or his organs start shutting down… etc.



Once he seemed to start grasping the enormity of what abortion encompasses and seeing why it’s very important to not let unknown people control what options you have with no medical reason… I told him I lost a bit of respect for willful ignorance (and that I can tell he avoided thinking about it bc he knows in some way that it says something about his character) and I RESENTED having to even give him a hypothetical in the first place and that if he cares for me and our daughter that he should automatically actively be using his empathy skills every day. I explained how I have demonstrated the capacity to care about and evaluate gender issues he’s brought to my attention in the past. That was a… difficult part of the conversation. I also told him that I do not trust him to always make good decisions for us and that I feel alone in my shouldering of those responsibilities.



He listened and let me talk a lot. He asked if I was going to leave him and he was clearly nervous and bracing for the worst. I told him I’m not taking drastic steps like that but I certainly will when it comes to keeping our daughter healthy and safe. I also started to say something about how I know I would lie to him in a heartbeat in a situation where our daughter needed an abortion or medical care and he interrupted me to say “You wouldn’t have to lie because I’ll be driving the car or buying the plane tickets and we will all go anywhere we need to”. Y’all, I burst into tears.



We ended the conversation and he said I laid a lot on him and he needed a break but said he had things to think about. I didn’t push any more politics but I think I feel like my trust has been slightly restored. I’m not getting my hopes up but I think he realizes that he’s wading in dark and dangerous waters when it comes to our futures.

>All of this reminds me so much of that scene in the show The Handmaid’s‘s Tale where June finds out that she’s not allowed to access her bank account anymore and that her husband has to sign something for her to get birth control pills, and her husband dismisses her concerns, basically saying, that’s OK, I’ll take care of you, no big deal, it’s fine. It’s easy to dismiss a concern when that concern doesn’t seem to affect you directly. And the problem is that no matter what we say, no matter what example we give, some people will always have a degree of removal from an issue that can affect their understanding and their empathy.  


>My own husband is empathetic and caring. But he doesn’t understand why I, someone staring down the barrel of menopause, is so angry about abortion access restrictions. He doesn’t understand why I, a woman in a loving marriage that doesn’t look likely to end anytime soon, is upset about the end of no-fault divorce. Or why I as someone with no connection to prison, is upset about our horribly inequitable carceral system. And he will say he understands my objections, but then he’s like, why bother wasting energy getting upset about it? I don’t know how to get across to him that just because it doesn’t apply to me/us right now doesn’t mean it won’t later. I also don’t know how to get across to him that it’s very difficult to see attacks on our ability to get a divorce or access an abortion as a direct slap against me as a woman. If someone punches someone else like me in the face while staring me directly in the eye to show me that they would be doing it to me if they could, that’s very upsetting. But they aren’t looking him in the eye, so he doesn’t see it that way.

[I’ve realized I have lost all respect for willful ignorance and it may damage my marriage.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1e01bnk/ive_realized_i_have_lost_all_respect_for_willful/) July 10, 2024



I (33F) and my husband (37M) were having a discussion about politics and we got onto the topic of our daughter (7F) which led to me expressing my fears about her rights and bodily autonomy.



*For context, my husband votes Republican and I have always considered myself independent but recently have been shifting very far away from my younger “carefree” attitude toward politics. I love him very much and I know for a fact that he loves me but I have started finding his opinions naive and lacking depth. He is a very good man though and has in the past changed his mind on several things when confronted with them.* 



*FURTHER context: my cousin lives in a strict anti-abortion state and almost died a few years ago when the doctors waited until she was actively dying of sepsis before they decided it was okay to remove the dead baby from her body even though it had been dead for weeks beforehand (so needless to say I had a wake-up call and sharpened up my principles until they are very shiny and pointy)*



Last night when we were talking about abortion rights being healthcare, I lost my composure out of sheer terror about the possibility of a similar disaster with my cousin happening to our daughter and how I struggle to understand how he doesn’t see the problem with his party and that in fact I think he is being willfully ignorant to the danger I and my daughter face in favor of his idea about making economics work for our family. I also said that if our daughter dies due to something preventable, like the ability to get a timely and much needed abortion, or gets shot to death in school that I would let my own mother rot in a nursing home (she votes R too) and I’d never be able to look him in the face again which would basically be me disappearing and divorcing him.



I was crying and upset and explaining how scared I was and he asked me in a very hurt manner if I’d actually abandon him like that I am truthful to a fault and said that I would, perhaps out of a sense of illogical grief and betrayal, because I’d know my concerns were not taken seriously and that they had abandoned common sense and did nothing to attempt preventing a very real consequence of voting away mine and my daughter’s right to healthcare. I equated it to a slow motion car wreck with our daughter in mortal danger and him just watching it happen bc it doesn’t involve his own body.



I know he needs to hear it. But I think I was too raw and open about it to steer the conversation in a healthy way and I have a very blunt manner. I apologized this morning for saying that I’d leave him, even though I knew I would, and he tentatively accepted it. And I said we’d talk about things later when I can articulate things in a healthier way. But I’m at a loss as to how to make it known how deadly serious this is to me and not make him feel like I’d abandon our marriage over just any sensitive topic.



I do not need people telling me to leave him. I don’t think I know how to make it any more digestible and be clear without going nuclear over something that has not happened as our daughter is too young to suffer that yet. The rub is that I am the person who is changing the dynamic of our relationship. And I am beginning to understand how politics breaks up families.

**PrincessNopal**:

>Ask him to name scenarios that he would accept the premature death of his daughter. Ask him to name what life saving healthcare he would be willing to deny for his daughter based on principles. If he can’t name any, ask him why is abortion different. Use your cousin’s story as a hypothetical for your daughter but be as graphic with it as you can be. But in all honesty, if you must labor so much to convince him to care about yours and your daughter’s health and well-being, then this should also serve as a wake up call to you. And if I were you, I’d take back your apology. You meant what you said and only apologized to comfort him. I say let him be uncomfortable. Why are you so concerned with the bluntness of your words and not concerned about how quick he is to dismiss you?

  
**owltower22**:

>I’m the daughter of a republican dad and liberal mom. I’m honestly not sure why they are still together, and think it is because they are older and retired. Luckily I live in a liberal state that doesn’t take away human rights, so I think it allows my mom not to think about it as much. It’s been since trump that I’ve really seen the division between them.  


>I don’t really have any advice to give you, but the perspective from a daughter in a similar type of situation. I love my dad, but I don’t have a lot of respect for him because I don’t think he actually understands what’s going on. It hurts as a daughter to know my dad votes for a party that is actively doing bad to a lot of human rights mainly because he believes in the economics of republicans. I also hate having to be around my parents in the evening, specially if they are watching the news. My mom definitely holds frustration for my dad and takes it out by saying mean things to him. And I feel like my dad doesn’t take it seriously, because I don’t think he actually understands how scary this is for certain people. I wish my parents would do therapy together, and honestly you guys should probably do therapy together if you actually want to make your marriage work without resentment growing.

>The worst part is all these men talk about the economics of being a Republican when all the data shows time and time again that those economics are absolutely horrible for 99.9% of us

**Ysadey**:

>I understand why you don't want advice to leave him, but you may have to accept that as your reality simply because your morals, values, and ethics are no longer compatible. But of course, do everything you can to try to reach him. Obviously, deep down, you know him and know he has the potential.   
  
>I went through this with my own husband years ago. And I wasn't nice about it. It was pretty much a deal breaker for me then, and now, and he was too busy being smugly libertarian on every other issue, so I had nothing to lose. That said, once he extracted his head from his rectum, I've been happy to explain things from my perspective as long as he's willing to actually listen. He's not perfect, but he gets a lot that men generally don't or take for granted.  


>I do know that one of my big points was that his views meant I couldn't trust him. Women's reproductive rights sure don't affect men directly, but by not caring about the issue because they care about the women in their life, they are sending a clear message that women are interchangeable appliances. He either cares about the things that are important to you or he doesn't actually care about you. He can't claim to love and respect you and want a future with you if he's voting against your basic interests.  


>That is hurtful for you, but you are allowing him to center his feeling hurt because you threatened to divorce him someday. He's hurting you now, but he wants to focus on his potential future pain that would be a direct consequence of his behavior now. Let that sink in.  


>He is telling you exactly where you stand with him in multiple ways.  


>Further, he's deluded if he thinks voting for Trump/Republicans is going to actually be good for his finances. Maybe in the short term. The reality is that any gains he makes will be offset by the tax overhaul and tarrif system. If your wealth is dependent on your income in any significant way, Trump winning would put your income at risk as women are forced out of the workplace and into a housewife role. If your income depends on either of you working overtime, Trump is giving employers a way to deny overtime premiums through creative scheduling. A lot of tex deductions and credits that primarily benefit low- and middle-class families are being eliminated while those that benefit the wealthiest are left intact or strengthened. We've already had a preview of his roided out trickle-down economy from his first term. Your husband is being incredibly short-sighted.

  
**PurpleOrchid07**:

>I'm not sure what you are trying to achieve with this post? You say you don't need people telling you to leave him.  
  
>However, the harsh reality is, that this situation? That is your present and your future, as long as you stick with ""republican"" men. He is not a ""very good man"" when he puts your, your daughter's and every other woman's life at risk by voting for people who want nothing but destruction and power. That doesn't change, no matter how much you gaslight yourself that you can somehow ""fix him"" or see reason. Sorry to be so blunt about it.

We’re Not In MOASS Territory (yet),"It’s good to see that DFV is back and tweeting again like in 2021, but I would like to stress the importance of not letting yourself get consumed by that “euphoric stage”. 

As already pointed out by Ape “TheUltimator5”, SHFs are doubling down on shorts. Nobody blew up, and there hasn’t been any closing of short positions.

Yes, the GME price passed critical margin levels, but that just means that SHFs are in a tougher state to maintain algorithmic control. Maybe DFV saw a purchase happen behind the scenes, or a signal go off, or maybe he’s been told he’s free to tweet now and saw the opportunity now to start tweeting again. Either way, he sees SHFs are in a more vulnerable position and is in “competitive mode”. 

It doesn’t necessarily mean MOASS has started yet. I’ve been looking at MSM articles, many from known SHF-owned sites are “too” positive about this rally.

Various places (can’t name them bc brigading restrictions on SuperStonk) are encouraging GME/basket stock YOLO call options. I’ve seen this behavior before—March last year and June 2021 for example. In both of those rallies, SHFs still had control and rug pulled the stock when euphoria was at its peak.

I hate to be pessimistic here (especially when DFV returned), but SHFs are so far still somewhat in control. If they weren’t, we’d be going up by thousands every minute. 

Institutions currently have tons of call options, which they bought prior to this rally (similar to when institutions bought calls in April prior to the June 2021 run). This, at least, allows them to hedge the price increase to some degree. This, at worst, gives them the power move of making bank on the call options, selling covered calls (buying puts) at the top, then rug pulling the stock at the highest moment and scooping up options premiums.

The S&P 500 hasn’t moved yet, and the VIX is still well below 40 (although it has moved up a decent amount yesterday). That tells me that we haven’t gotten to MOASS territory.

SHFs increased their collateral significantly this past year from the S&P 500’s 27% gain; they can afford a higher GME price. 

It feels like 2021 to see the price jump like this again, but I also can’t let my emotions get the best of me. 

We’ve been here for years, we’ve seen them play so many tricks on us. Let’s not get too crazy here and assume they folded and GME is now squeezing.

Institutions currently have tons of call options, which they bought prior to this rally (similar to when institutions bought calls in April prior to the June 2021 run). This, at least, allows them to hedge the price increase to some degree. This, at worst, gives them the power move of making bank on the call options, selling covered calls (buying puts) at the top, then rug pulling the stock at the highest moment and scooping up options premiums.

The S&P 500 hasn’t moved yet, and the VIX is still well below 40 (although it has moved up a decent amount yesterday). That tells me that we haven’t gotten to MOASS territory.

SHFs increased their collateral significantly this past year from the S&P 500’s 27% gain; they can afford a higher GME price. 

It feels like 2021 to see the price jump like this again, but I also can’t let my emotions get the best of me. 

We’ve been here for years, we’ve seen them play so many tricks on us. Let’s not get too crazy here and assume they folded and GME is now squeezing.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/wsEOHLyVYK)  **Apr 27, 2024** 

Throwaway account as my husband and In-laws are follow my main. I, 29 F, have been married to my husband, 30 m, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I met in college during our freshman year. We started off as just friends, and got married seven months ago. I've gotten along with his family, but we aren't super close but we're friendly enough. The problem is that Alex has begun to make me incredibly uncomfortable. 

Firstly, he's begun to ask me who I'm meeting with, where, what we plan on doing, how long every single time I leave the house without him. At first, I just thought he was being protective and a good partner just in case something happened, but then he started checking my phone after the visits, vetting and researching each of my friends as well. 

He also has been pursuing me to link my bank account to his, as he's ""in charge"" of the finances when he was perfectly fine with keeping them separate before. We fight about it almost every day. 

Finally, yesterday when he was preparing to go on a work trip for two weeks in California, he demanded I wear a tracker so he could keep and eye on me while he's gone. I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm suffocating and his family who I've spoken to about his worrying behavior just said he's being careful and protective as a good husband should. I need to gather my things together and find a way to be gone before he gets home without tipping him off. 

He's always threatened that if he ever found me cheating on him he'd turn in divorce papers the same day. He keeps a filled out copy in his desk. I'm going to submit those the day I leave. But there's so much to do, bergen finding a new place to live, seeing if my job has any transfers available, packing and moving in two weeks. His return flight  May 11th, so I need to move quickly. I'm posting here because I don't have any close family, and I can't risk dragging my friends into this as we share the same friends.I just needed a place to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice on the easiest and safest way to do this? 

Edit: oh my god you guys are amazing! I never even thought to not use his divorce papers. I'll check for cameras before I start any packing or prepping. I may also shred his divorce papers just in case and look into getting a lawyer for myself. I'm in a no fault divorce state, that much I so remember which will help. I'll update again when I know more. The tracker he wants me to use is a small clip to put on the belt or waistband. I'll wear it unless I'm going or doing something related to me leaving. No pets yet thankfully.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/v6qRzYi8XD)  **Apr 28, 2024** 

So I've gotten a lot of support and helpful advice along with questions I thought I should clarify before I proceed with the update. Some asked why I'd be 'hiding' things from Alex regarding going out and who I'm meeting with. I don't, and I have nothing to hide. However when he begins to then double check everything I tell him with the other people there right down to each person I talked to and what I said. Did I send any text msgs, did I order food, how much did I eat, that's when it started to feel like I was slowly being pushed into a corner. It didn't start that bad, but gradually grew worse overtime. 

All of the Reddit subs my in-law's families are part of are related gardening and diy so I highly doubt they'll see this, if so by the time they do, I'll hopefully be gone. I talked to my job and explained things to my manager. And they promised to look into openings in other states to see if they could get me into one. They'll have an update on that in three days. I trust that my bank account us secured, considering he's tried to get into it before and failed. I found one camera in the kitchen, another in the living room and one in our bedroom. As such, I've left them in place for now and done all other planning, either in the bathroom pretending I'm taking a bath. 

I'm honestly staying away from the domestic violence services as my sister-in-law is unfortunately higher up in those considering she volunteers there and I have a feeling if I did show up there, they would know in a heartbeat. I can't look for apartments until I get the update from my work, but either or i'm still gonna be leaving the state. The day before I do I will be changing my number carrier and wiping my laptop and all of his electronics before I do. 

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him. 

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job. 

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time. 

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2hLOsd7Kbg)  **Apr 30, 2024** 

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL  to show me his favorite recipes. 

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm. 

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind. 

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in. 

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/AXTZmkIqAB)  **May 7, 2024** 

Update 3: I have 2 weeks to get away from my husband. 

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left. 

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through. 

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this. 

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.


[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/F2jysvg8bc)  **May 14, 2024** 

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him. 

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex. 

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess. 

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.   

[Update on leaving](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/958o4qYgbB)  **May 26, 2024** 

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change. 

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in. 

The responses I got from the emails varied. His family said I was overreacting, and that I owe Alex an apology for the problems this has caused him. The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild. As much as I want to say I was surprised by the lack of support, I’m honestly not. 

He intends to fight the divorce. I am letting my lawyer handle it, and I am also pursuing a protective order as well. Once I got approved for my apartment, I also froze my credit. I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA. 

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage. 

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water. 

##**NEW UPDATE**
* 

[Another Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/78UYNmEZUt)  **June 25, 2024** 

It’s been a month since my previous update, and I wanted to share some of what’s been going on in the meantime. The divorce is proceeding, but even though I don’t need him to agree – and he’s not – it means I have to go through the courts to get it approved. As such, it could be upwards of six months to push it through even though I’m filing without attempting to claim property, alimony or compensation. I just want a clean break and separation. 

Alex has attempted to use our friends to reach out to me, as he doesn’t want to use my lawyer for communication. He’s saying its disrespectful and cowardly to hide behind my lawyer and not meet him face to face. Alex wrote me a letter that he did pass off to my lawyer, but the contents were him justifying his actions and claiming that in today's time it is dangerous for women to be on their own which is why he was so intent on trying to keep me safe from harm. He wanted me to understand that he was trying to protect me as best he could and was hurt that I would just lie to him and hide my actions from him related to my dissatisfaction with our marriage and my moving. 

I didn’t reply, because at no point did he apologize. All he did was turn everything around on me as I was being overly dramatic, emotional and cowardly. There was a second letter with Alex’s from my SIL. Her letter… was honestly disturbing and completely justified my misgivings regarding approaching her in any kind of professional capacity. She spent five paragraphs detailing how a ‘real abusive’ relationship looked like and that Alex was the furthest thing from abusive. The details she included were all related to financial abuse and physical abuse. Nothing like what Alex had been doing. She stated that my attempts to smear her brother’s name for attention and clout made me the abuser not him. 

I haven’t really been able to process that admittedly. Part of me can’t help but wonder if she’s right. I mean, I blindsided him by leaving as I did and am refusing to speak with him at all. My old boss recommended that I look into getting into therapy after I moved, and I think I need to. I have had a hard time adjusting to being on my own, I keep censoring myself and haven’t even gone out to eat yet. I always end up worrying about what if someone sees me, what if I get in trouble for spending my money on something frivolous… 

My lawyer is continuing to fight for the divorce, and I shouldn’t need to be physically present in court. Any meetings needed between me and the judge can be done via zoom. I’m trying to avoid confrontation with Alex and his family for now as much as I can and passed both letters to my lawyer in case he needs them. Our friends are mostly trying to avoid taking sides still, and I’m honestly approaching the point of just letting them go as well. I’m tired of fighting for them to understand at this point. I don’t know if anything is going to happen, so my next update may not be until around mid-November depending on how long it takes to push the divorce through. Work is going well, and it’s helpful to have something familiar to anchor my day to day life when so much has changed and is changing even now.

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him. 

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job. 

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time. 

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2hLOsd7Kbg)  **Apr 30, 2024** 

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL  to show me his favorite recipes. 

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm. 

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind. 

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in. 

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/AXTZmkIqAB)  **May 7, 2024** 

Update 3: I have 2 weeks to get away from my husband. 

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left. 

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through. 

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this. 

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.


[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/F2jysvg8bc)  **May 14, 2024** 

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him. 

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex. 

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess. 

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.   

[Update on leaving](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/958o4qYgbB)  **May 26, 2024** 

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change. 

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in. 

The responses I got from the emails varied. His family said I was overreacting, and that I owe Alex an apology for the problems this has caused him. The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild. As much as I want to say I was surprised by the lack of support, I’m honestly not. 

He intends to fight the divorce. I am letting my lawyer handle it, and I am also pursuing a protective order as well. Once I got approved for my apartment, I also froze my credit. I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA. 

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage. 

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water. 

##**NEW UPDATE**
* 

[Another Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/78UYNmEZUt)  **June 25, 2024** 

It’s been a month since my previous update, and I wanted to share some of what’s been going on in the meantime. The divorce is proceeding, but even though I don’t need him to agree – and he’s not – it means I have to go through the courts to get it approved. As such, it could be upwards of six months to push it through even though I’m filing without attempting to claim property, alimony or compensation. I just want a clean break and separation. 

Alex has attempted to use our friends to reach out to me, as he doesn’t want to use my lawyer for communication. He’s saying its disrespectful and cowardly to hide behind my lawyer and not meet him face to face. Alex wrote me a letter that he did pass off to my lawyer, but the contents were him justifying his actions and claiming that in today's time it is dangerous for women to be on their own which is why he was so intent on trying to keep me safe from harm. He wanted me to understand that he was trying to protect me as best he could and was hurt that I would just lie to him and hide my actions from him related to my dissatisfaction with our marriage and my moving. 

I didn’t reply, because at no point did he apologize. All he did was turn everything around on me as I was being overly dramatic, emotional and cowardly. There was a second letter with Alex’s from my SIL. Her letter… was honestly disturbing and completely justified my misgivings regarding approaching her in any kind of professional capacity. She spent five paragraphs detailing how a ‘real abusive’ relationship looked like and that Alex was the furthest thing from abusive. The details she included were all related to financial abuse and physical abuse. Nothing like what Alex had been doing. She stated that my attempts to smear her brother’s name for attention and clout made me the abuser not him. 

I haven’t really been able to process that admittedly. Part of me can’t help but wonder if she’s right. I mean, I blindsided him by leaving as I did and am refusing to speak with him at all. My old boss recommended that I look into getting into therapy after I moved, and I think I need to. I have had a hard time adjusting to being on my own, I keep censoring myself and haven’t even gone out to eat yet. I always end up worrying about what if someone sees me, what if I get in trouble for spending my money on something frivolous… 

My lawyer is continuing to fight for the divorce, and I shouldn’t need to be physically present in court. Any meetings needed between me and the judge can be done via zoom. I’m trying to avoid confrontation with Alex and his family for now as much as I can and passed both letters to my lawyer in case he needs them. Our friends are mostly trying to avoid taking sides still, and I’m honestly approaching the point of just letting them go as well. I’m tired of fighting for them to understand at this point. I don’t know if anything is going to happen, so my next update may not be until around mid-November depending on how long it takes to push the divorce through. Work is going well, and it’s helpful to have something familiar to anchor my day to day life when so much has changed and is changing even now.

**AITA: Dad's Properties, My Abusive Ex, and a Necessary Boundary**

Okay, this is a complicated one and therefore long so please bear with me. My ex-husband (let's call him ""Chad"") was emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. We have 2 kids together, and co-parenting has been a nightmare, even after I remarried and had another child. He's manipulative, controlling, and just an all-around toxic human being.

My dad owns several rental properties. Some were purchased while I was married to Chad, some *after* we divorced. These houses were always seen as an investments by my dad for his family and as he says ""generational wealth"". He always talked about leaving houses for his 3 kids in his will. Well, he currently co-owns 6 of these properties 50/50 *with Chad.* This makes me incredibly uncomfortable.

Here’s the core issue: My dad wants a relationship with me *now*, but he refuses to acknowledge the horrific abuse I endured at Chad’s hands. He refuses to cut ties with Chad, despite knowing some of the details. This makes both me and my current husband incredibly nervous and uncomfortable. It feels like a complete betrayal. And honestly, it's baffling.

Here's the kicker: Chad makes my dad money. Money my dad is currently living off of (clearly, the concept of generational wealth is lost on him). Meanwhile, I have *zero* financial ties to my dad. I don't give him money, and I certainly don't take any from him. Chad, on the other hand, only partners with my dad because my dad has the capital to fund these real estate deals. Chad, being a contractor, handles the renovations. They then split the profits 50/50. So, my dad fronts the cash, takes all the risk, and doesn't even recoup his initial investment, while Chad gets richer off the deal. And to add insult to injury, Chad doesn't pay a dime in child support from this income, because it's all conveniently in my dad's name, so it didn't ""count"" as Chad's income during our divorce. It's a truly messed up situation.

To make matters worse, during my *very* difficult and abusive divorce, my dad – knowing some of the things Chad did – actually told me he was *praying* for me and Chad to reconcile. This is the kind of man my dad is: more concerned with appearances and what certain circles of his ""Christian"" community think than with the actual reality of the situation and the well-being of his own daughter.

And it gets worse. It's not just a business relationship. My dad and Chad actually… socialize. They hang out. Church, lunches, dinners, birthday parties – the whole nine yards. My dad's excuse? They ""never talk about me."" Which, frankly, I find incredibly hard to believe. Even if they *aren't* actively gossiping about me, the very fact that my dad chooses to spend time with my abuser, to share meals and celebrate milestones with him, speaks volumes. It sends a clear message: that his comfort and his financial interests are more important than my well-being and my peace of mind. It feels like he's choosing Chad over me, over and over again.

I’ve tried to have conversations with him about this. I’ve tried to explain how his continued relationship with Chad and his refusal to acknowledge the abuse is hurting me. I’ve explained how it makes me feel unsafe and unsupported. But he just brushes it off, saying things like, “You need to forgive and forget,” or ""I don't want to get involved.""

So, here's where I might be the AH: I’ve set a boundary. I’ve told my dad that I cannot have a relationship with him until he:

1. Severs all business ties with Chad and ensures that Chad no longer has any financial interest in any of the properties.

2. Acknowledges the abuse I suffered and stops minimizing it or trying to force me to reconcile with my abuser (even after the fact).

I also told him that until these things are addressed, I want nothing to do with his **will**. I don't want any potential inheritance to be used as a tool for Chad to try to contact me or manipulate me in the future.

Am I being unreasonable? Am I the AH for setting these boundaries? I feel like I have no other choice. I need to protect myself, my husband, and my children from Chad’s influence. But I also feel incredibly sad and conflicted. I love my dad, but I can’t tolerate this any longer. I feel like the daughter-in-law that divorced his son. Help me, Reddit. Am I the bad guy for protecting myself?

**\[TLDR:** My dad refuses to cut ties with my abusive ex-husband and refuses to acknowledge the abuse I suffered. I told him I can’t have a relationship with him until he does these things and removes Chad from any property ownership. AITA?**\]**

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** NTA- Just out of curiosity, what are you siblings and family saying about his continued involvement? Are you getting any support there?

> **OOP:** It's a really long, complicated story but not really. My sister is also friends with Chad. My brother hates Chad, but we don't really talk because his wife and I don't get along since my divorce. (this is a really really long story that actually overlaps into my current husband's (Thomas) divorce.)

**The betrayal of a parent must be the most painful for OOP**

> **OOP:** Thank you! I was such a daddy's girl before all of this happened too. There was one night where Chad and I were fighting (prior to the divorce) and he balled his fist and lunged at me. In the last second decided to hit the wall next to my head instead of me (he knew his life would be over if he made a mark).
> 
> I was texting my dad through the entire thing. He did nothing: did not come over, did not call Chad, NOTHING! He says it's because I told him not to, but I was in a very thick trauma response in that moment. I was worried about Chad getting set off again, not my own safety. Trauma is such a liar!
> 
> The next day Chad took my dad to breakfast, told him his side of the story and asked for forgiveness. Which my dad give him. Nobody asked for my forgiveness, nobody even called to check on me or the kids.
> 
> And the final detail that's worth noting, Chad and I were fighting about MY BROTHER! Chad didn't want him to come over to our house anymore because they legitimately hated each other. So my dad sided with Chad over his daughter and son.
> 
> *I do not know what Chad said to my dad at that breakfast still to this day, but I know my dad knows my side of the story because I told him. No remorse.

**Commenter 2:** NTA. Protect your peace. But don't be afraid to enact vengeance lol you can always report their business to spark an investigation.

> **OOP:** It's obvious to everyone except him, unfortunately. I have since started a nonprofit which is ironic because during my divorce my dad told him me and my mom that he, ""wasn't running a charity"" when my mom suggested me and my kids live in one of his rental houses that needed work. I was willing to help fix it up, given my design background.
> 
> I'm a personal trainer and nutrition coach and started getting really annoyed that the people who most needed my services and knowledge could not afford the insane prices my gym set (I was charging $65-110/hr at the gym I was working for). My nonprofit is now online so I offer 3 workouts weekly, unlimited nutrition coaching, and book club style life coaching for way less than the average, and work with people that need it but cannot afford it.
> 
> We also have many other projects we are currently working on (more here if interested: ltwcdc.org). All of this was sparked because of my dad, his insane treatment of me, my trauma therapist helping me iron out my feelings and my mentor that made me believe this dream was possible.
> 
> I'm focusing on living my BEST life, growing my nonprofit to help as many people as I possibly can! My life motto is ""Be who you needed when you were younger"", I'm trying to be the person I wish I had during the hardest part of my life. It sucks that my dad is choosing not to be a part of it but it's his choice. I told him what I need from him and he hasn't done anything to move in that direction. But that's on him.
> 
> I'm not angry... anymore. I've forgiven everyone and are setting the necessary boundaries with them all. Chad and I still share custody of the kids 50/50, although he asks me to take them a lot so I doubt it's actually 50/50. As far as providing, my dad does not see paying child support as ""providing"" he sees it as a hand out. The fact that Chad pays me anything means he's ""providing"" and Chad also gets the kids things when they are with him.
> 
> It would be a blood bath if we went back to court (which Chad threatens all the time). EVERYONE would be subpoenaed and it would affectively destroy my extended family. I will only push that button if Chad forces my hand.

**Additional Information from OOP after reading about Chad paying child support**

> **OOP:** So I've seen this comment a few times, just to be clear Chad does pay CS. He is frequently late but he does pay it. The catch is, he owns his own company and if you have ever does that before you know you can do a lot of loop holes in paying yourself. During the divorce I could only prove his income to be at the $80K mark, he tried to say it was $50k. He earns a lot more than that but because he pays his bills through is company the money never enters his personal account and therefore doesn't count as income. At the time of our divorce he was paying our $1200 mortgage and putting the same amount in a TDA account WEEKLY!! My lawyer knew he made more than $80k but the legal battle would have taken years!! Even our mediator said his books for his company were a ""mess"".
> 
> I willingly chose not to go to court and fight this because I just wanted the marriage to be over! I got a lump sum payment (bc I did not want alimony) plus child support and I was done! It was over a decade of the most insane emotional and verbal abuse and I was a shell of my former person. I wanted to give my kids another option on how to live, even if that was only 50% of the time. I believe mine and my new husband's example will shine brighter in their lives than his will. (It's already starting)
> 
> Now thanks to the parenting plan I have a legally binding contract I can hold him to when he tries to side step or gaslight me. Our plan also has a clause that says ""in the event that a decision cannot be reached the decision will fall to the mother until mediation can be scheduled"". The decision falls to me and I leave it up to him to schedule mediation, which he knows I know he's doing shady stuff in his business.
> 
> Unfortunately I cannot afford to take him on legally. Not yet. If he decided to take me to court I'm sure I would figure it out, but it's risky and time consuming.
> 
> I have thought about tipping off the IRS but I'm waiting with that info incase he takes me to court. I will have his entire life and business audited and since he works with my dad on a handshake agreement, (no contract, no EIN, no trust account) my dad will be forced to show everything in discovery. And since I do have an EIN and trust account it will be harder for him to see my assets.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/s/s8mheLDfU1): **March 15, 2025 (3.5 weeks later)**

Woah, thanks for all the support, everyone. Turns out y'all were right. Here's an update, then I'm going to have to stop updating on this and move on with my life.

In the last few weeks, my mom’s oldest sister passed away. She had been sick for a while, so this wasn’t shocking news, but still sad. I called my mom to be polite and offer my condolences (I wasn’t close with this particular aunt). I also made it clear I wouldn’t bring up any of our drama and would only talk about it if she did. Well, as per usual, she used her sister’s death to shame me saying that “in 10 years, this could be me, and I don’t want our family to not be speaking to each other like this,” or something along those lines.

So, I restated my boundary: once they get out of business and stop communicating so friendly with my ex and show me some loyalty, then that won’t be a problem, and we can work on our issues. She said she won’t turn her back on her grandkids because he’s the only way she sees them. I reminded her that that’s only been a recent development and that she never set boundaries with him ever. In the same phone call she told me she went to his house around Christmas time. He also shows up to my nieces birthday parties.

Then, she told me she’s angry that I dated my new husband and got pregnant with my youngest without going to her for help (because I was 34, my husband is incredibly supportive and loving, and the most amazing man I’ve ever known). She’s literally mad that I’m able to take responsibility for my own choices and don’t need to turn to her for every little issue. I honestly still don’t understand that one.

My dad has done absolutely nothing about his business with my ex. He is living off the money he’s making with my ex even thought he calls it “generational wealth”. I don’t think that phrase means what he thinks it means.

My sister decided to send me endless texts that ended with her openly admitting she has nothing to be responsible for (she is a crying shoulder for my ex-husband and asked me if I felt sorry for him at Thanksgiving two years ago…yes she does know a lot of the things he did to me and my kids. Think verbal abuse, toxic masculinity, gaslighting, name calling, financial abuse…etc). She also told me that my “healing and growth is selfish” because I’m not including her in it. I seriously wish I was making this up.

The only successful conversation I had was with my younger brother, but even he isn’t sure about my new husband (which is weird because they are so similar). Basically he told me not to date anyone and I dated my now husband and it worked out and he’s mad about it. Again: I was 34 he was 28.

I don’t know if they don’t like that I didn’t take their advice or if they don’t like that it worked out for me despite me not taking their advice. I wish I had a better explanation for this but I just don’t.

I’m not sure where all this will go, but I’m holding to my boundaries and moving forward with some pretty big goals my new husband and I have for our nonprofit (which helps people in life transitions who don’t have support… lemon into lemonade).

Thanks for the support, and I know this update is vague, but if I typed out the WHOLE story, it would be a dissertation. It is so unbearably complicated and honestly confusing because of the delulu thinking of my toxic family.

I haven’t blocked anyone because I just can’t bring myself to do that to my family, but I moved an hour away from them and only respond when I’m ready to. I will hold up my boundaries, but my focus is on my family and our NEW BABY!! I just found out I’m 5 weeks pregnant!! It’s sad that my parents and siblings are going to miss out on a relationship with my two youngest because they can’t let go of the life I rejected, but I know I’m a cycle breaker, and with that comes being the villain. A title I will happily wear.

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP on her father's CPA (Certified Public Accountant) and he should see how much he is losing in the process**

> **OOP:** He has a CPA it’s his brother in law. When I mentioned my non profit and how trust accounts work my dad said “that sounds illegal” 🫣 All I said was I was putting my business into a trust to protect it and paying myself through the trust. This makes me think my uncle isn’t the best but who knows. My uncle is not my CPA.

**Commenter 1:** Honestly your family sounds like a cult and they are just mad you broke free from the cult and therefore their control. Time for absolute no contact with them and going to a good family lawyer in your area to petition for child support with proof of the fraud.

> **OOP:** I said it feels like I left a cult or Scientology, because my mom and sister keep tabs with me online since I use it to leverage my businesses and gossip to my brother about it.

**How many kids does OOP have?**

> **OOP:** I actually have 5 kids. 4 bio and 1 step.

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/s/78VT3mbbZu) **March 15, 2025 (same day, one hour later)**

OMG one more update that I discovered in therapy! I know y’all will appreciate this! (Btw Charlotte, I’m southern and I LOVE when you use your southern accent! If you read any of these posts please use it!)

While I was going through my divorce, my brother and his wife were renting a house from my dad. I was at their house one day (we used to be very close) and I noticed the house next door was getting ready for an estate sale. Since I know my dad likes buying houses in that neighborhood I went to check it out. My dad has done rentals my entire life so I’m pretty good at feeling out the bones of a house.

Well I told him and my mom about it and suggested he get it, let me and my kids live there while I help him fix it up. It really just needed some painting and some minor kitchen modernizing. It’s a 3BD/2BA and the same layout as my brother’s house. With this plan I could get out of his house because at the time I was living with them and it was tense for everyone!

My mom seemed onboard with the idea but my dad rolled his eyes and said, “I’m not running a charity.”

Obviously I broke down crying. He apologized and said some excuse that I don’t remember because it was complete BS.

Well, I have recently realized while verbally processing in therapy that my idea IS THE EXACT SAME CONCEPT MY EX PRESENTED TO HIM! My dad fronts the money, my ex does the work, they split the profits 50/50! I wasn’t even presenting to split the profits!

I feel like my dad really missed a huge opportunity to help me start my own real estate hustle and teach me to do what he is doing. He could have helped me get back on my feet and set my kids up for life!! Once this realization hit me it was like I saw my dad in a completely different light. I don’t even think he realizes how full of hot air he is.

It seems we wanted me subservient and not to have independence. I think he thought if my life was as hard as possible I would go back to my ex and shame would have been lift from my family, but I would have walked to hell and back before I did that.

Anyway…this is a pretty good picture of the “generational wealth” my dad likes to talk about. He brags about getting into business with my ex to help his grandkids but when presented with a way to help their mother (HIS DAUGHTER) now it’s a charity.

Make it make sense.

**AITA: Dad's Properties, My Abusive Ex, and a Necessary Boundary**

Okay, this is a complicated one and therefore long so please bear with me. My ex-husband (let's call him ""Chad"") was emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. We have 2 kids together, and co-parenting has been a nightmare, even after I remarried and had another child. He's manipulative, controlling, and just an all-around toxic human being.

My dad owns several rental properties. Some were purchased while I was married to Chad, some *after* we divorced. These houses were always seen as an investments by my dad for his family and as he says ""generational wealth"". He always talked about leaving houses for his 3 kids in his will. Well, he currently co-owns 6 of these properties 50/50 *with Chad.* This makes me incredibly uncomfortable.

Here’s the core issue: My dad wants a relationship with me *now*, but he refuses to acknowledge the horrific abuse I endured at Chad’s hands. He refuses to cut ties with Chad, despite knowing some of the details. This makes both me and my current husband incredibly nervous and uncomfortable. It feels like a complete betrayal. And honestly, it's baffling.

Here's the kicker: Chad makes my dad money. Money my dad is currently living off of (clearly, the concept of generational wealth is lost on him). Meanwhile, I have *zero* financial ties to my dad. I don't give him money, and I certainly don't take any from him. Chad, on the other hand, only partners with my dad because my dad has the capital to fund these real estate deals. Chad, being a contractor, handles the renovations. They then split the profits 50/50. So, my dad fronts the cash, takes all the risk, and doesn't even recoup his initial investment, while Chad gets richer off the deal. And to add insult to injury, Chad doesn't pay a dime in child support from this income, because it's all conveniently in my dad's name, so it didn't ""count"" as Chad's income during our divorce. It's a truly messed up situation.

To make matters worse, during my *very* difficult and abusive divorce, my dad – knowing some of the things Chad did – actually told me he was *praying* for me and Chad to reconcile. This is the kind of man my dad is: more concerned with appearances and what certain circles of his ""Christian"" community think than with the actual reality of the situation and the well-being of his own daughter.

And it gets worse. It's not just a business relationship. My dad and Chad actually… socialize. They hang out. Church, lunches, dinners, birthday parties – the whole nine yards. My dad's excuse? They ""never talk about me."" Which, frankly, I find incredibly hard to believe. Even if they *aren't* actively gossiping about me, the very fact that my dad chooses to spend time with my abuser, to share meals and celebrate milestones with him, speaks volumes. It sends a clear message: that his comfort and his financial interests are more important than my well-being and my peace of mind. It feels like he's choosing Chad over me, over and over again.

I’ve tried to have conversations with him about this. I’ve tried to explain how his continued relationship with Chad and his refusal to acknowledge the abuse is hurting me. I’ve explained how it makes me feel unsafe and unsupported. But he just brushes it off, saying things like, “You need to forgive and forget,” or ""I don't want to get involved.""

So, here's where I might be the AH: I’ve set a boundary. I’ve told my dad that I cannot have a relationship with him until he:

1. Severs all business ties with Chad and ensures that Chad no longer has any financial interest in any of the properties.

2. Acknowledges the abuse I suffered and stops minimizing it or trying to force me to reconcile with my abuser (even after the fact).

I also told him that until these things are addressed, I want nothing to do with his **will**. I don't want any potential inheritance to be used as a tool for Chad to try to contact me or manipulate me in the future.

Am I being unreasonable? Am I the AH for setting these boundaries? I feel like I have no other choice. I need to protect myself, my husband, and my children from Chad’s influence. But I also feel incredibly sad and conflicted. I love my dad, but I can’t tolerate this any longer. I feel like the daughter-in-law that divorced his son. Help me, Reddit. Am I the bad guy for protecting myself?

**\[TLDR:** My dad refuses to cut ties with my abusive ex-husband and refuses to acknowledge the abuse I suffered. I told him I can’t have a relationship with him until he does these things and removes Chad from any property ownership. AITA?**\]**

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** NTA- Just out of curiosity, what are you siblings and family saying about his continued involvement? Are you getting any support there?

> **OOP:** It's a really long, complicated story but not really. My sister is also friends with Chad. My brother hates Chad, but we don't really talk because his wife and I don't get along since my divorce. (this is a really really long story that actually overlaps into my current husband's (Thomas) divorce.)

**The betrayal of a parent must be the most painful for OOP**

> **OOP:** Thank you! I was such a daddy's girl before all of this happened too. There was one night where Chad and I were fighting (prior to the divorce) and he balled his fist and lunged at me. In the last second decided to hit the wall next to my head instead of me (he knew his life would be over if he made a mark).
> 
> I was texting my dad through the entire thing. He did nothing: did not come over, did not call Chad, NOTHING! He says it's because I told him not to, but I was in a very thick trauma response in that moment. I was worried about Chad getting set off again, not my own safety. Trauma is such a liar!
> 
> The next day Chad took my dad to breakfast, told him his side of the story and asked for forgiveness. Which my dad give him. Nobody asked for my forgiveness, nobody even called to check on me or the kids.
> 
> And the final detail that's worth noting, Chad and I were fighting about MY BROTHER! Chad didn't want him to come over to our house anymore because they legitimately hated each other. So my dad sided with Chad over his daughter and son.
> 
> *I do not know what Chad said to my dad at that breakfast still to this day, but I know my dad knows my side of the story because I told him. No remorse.

**Commenter 2:** NTA. Protect your peace. But don't be afraid to enact vengeance lol you can always report their business to spark an investigation.

> **OOP:** It's obvious to everyone except him, unfortunately. I have since started a nonprofit which is ironic because during my divorce my dad told him me and my mom that he, ""wasn't running a charity"" when my mom suggested me and my kids live in one of his rental houses that needed work. I was willing to help fix it up, given my design background.
> 
> I'm a personal trainer and nutrition coach and started getting really annoyed that the people who most needed my services and knowledge could not afford the insane prices my gym set (I was charging $65-110/hr at the gym I was working for). My nonprofit is now online so I offer 3 workouts weekly, unlimited nutrition coaching, and book club style life coaching for way less than the average, and work with people that need it but cannot afford it.
> 
> We also have many other projects we are currently working on (more here if interested: ltwcdc.org). All of this was sparked because of my dad, his insane treatment of me, my trauma therapist helping me iron out my feelings and my mentor that made me believe this dream was possible.
> 
> I'm focusing on living my BEST life, growing my nonprofit to help as many people as I possibly can! My life motto is ""Be who you needed when you were younger"", I'm trying to be the person I wish I had during the hardest part of my life. It sucks that my dad is choosing not to be a part of it but it's his choice. I told him what I need from him and he hasn't done anything to move in that direction. But that's on him.
> 
> I'm not angry... anymore. I've forgiven everyone and are setting the necessary boundaries with them all. Chad and I still share custody of the kids 50/50, although he asks me to take them a lot so I doubt it's actually 50/50. As far as providing, my dad does not see paying child support as ""providing"" he sees it as a hand out. The fact that Chad pays me anything means he's ""providing"" and Chad also gets the kids things when they are with him.
> 
> It would be a blood bath if we went back to court (which Chad threatens all the time). EVERYONE would be subpoenaed and it would affectively destroy my extended family. I will only push that button if Chad forces my hand.

**Additional Information from OOP after reading about Chad paying child support**

> **OOP:** So I've seen this comment a few times, just to be clear Chad does pay CS. He is frequently late but he does pay it. The catch is, he owns his own company and if you have ever does that before you know you can do a lot of loop holes in paying yourself. During the divorce I could only prove his income to be at the $80K mark, he tried to say it was $50k. He earns a lot more than that but because he pays his bills through is company the money never enters his personal account and therefore doesn't count as income. At the time of our divorce he was paying our $1200 mortgage and putting the same amount in a TDA account WEEKLY!! My lawyer knew he made more than $80k but the legal battle would have taken years!! Even our mediator said his books for his company were a ""mess"".
> 
> I willingly chose not to go to court and fight this because I just wanted the marriage to be over! I got a lump sum payment (bc I did not want alimony) plus child support and I was done! It was over a decade of the most insane emotional and verbal abuse and I was a shell of my former person. I wanted to give my kids another option on how to live, even if that was only 50% of the time. I believe mine and my new husband's example will shine brighter in their lives than his will. (It's already starting)
> 
> Now thanks to the parenting plan I have a legally binding contract I can hold him to when he tries to side step or gaslight me. Our plan also has a clause that says ""in the event that a decision cannot be reached the decision will fall to the mother until mediation can be scheduled"". The decision falls to me and I leave it up to him to schedule mediation, which he knows I know he's doing shady stuff in his business.
> 
> Unfortunately I cannot afford to take him on legally. Not yet. If he decided to take me to court I'm sure I would figure it out, but it's risky and time consuming.
> 
> I have thought about tipping off the IRS but I'm waiting with that info incase he takes me to court. I will have his entire life and business audited and since he works with my dad on a handshake agreement, (no contract, no EIN, no trust account) my dad will be forced to show everything in discovery. And since I do have an EIN and trust account it will be harder for him to see my assets.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/s/s8mheLDfU1): **March 15, 2025 (3.5 weeks later)**

Woah, thanks for all the support, everyone. Turns out y'all were right. Here's an update, then I'm going to have to stop updating on this and move on with my life.

In the last few weeks, my mom’s oldest sister passed away. She had been sick for a while, so this wasn’t shocking news, but still sad. I called my mom to be polite and offer my condolences (I wasn’t close with this particular aunt). I also made it clear I wouldn’t bring up any of our drama and would only talk about it if she did. Well, as per usual, she used her sister’s death to shame me saying that “in 10 years, this could be me, and I don’t want our family to not be speaking to each other like this,” or something along those lines.

So, I restated my boundary: once they get out of business and stop communicating so friendly with my ex and show me some loyalty, then that won’t be a problem, and we can work on our issues. She said she won’t turn her back on her grandkids because he’s the only way she sees them. I reminded her that that’s only been a recent development and that she never set boundaries with him ever. In the same phone call she told me she went to his house around Christmas time. He also shows up to my nieces birthday parties.

Then, she told me she’s angry that I dated my new husband and got pregnant with my youngest without going to her for help (because I was 34, my husband is incredibly supportive and loving, and the most amazing man I’ve ever known). She’s literally mad that I’m able to take responsibility for my own choices and don’t need to turn to her for every little issue. I honestly still don’t understand that one.

My dad has done absolutely nothing about his business with my ex. He is living off the money he’s making with my ex even thought he calls it “generational wealth”. I don’t think that phrase means what he thinks it means.

My sister decided to send me endless texts that ended with her openly admitting she has nothing to be responsible for (she is a crying shoulder for my ex-husband and asked me if I felt sorry for him at Thanksgiving two years ago…yes she does know a lot of the things he did to me and my kids. Think verbal abuse, toxic masculinity, gaslighting, name calling, financial abuse…etc). She also told me that my “healing and growth is selfish” because I’m not including her in it. I seriously wish I was making this up.

The only successful conversation I had was with my younger brother, but even he isn’t sure about my new husband (which is weird because they are so similar). Basically he told me not to date anyone and I dated my now husband and it worked out and he’s mad about it. Again: I was 34 he was 28.

I don’t know if they don’t like that I didn’t take their advice or if they don’t like that it worked out for me despite me not taking their advice. I wish I had a better explanation for this but I just don’t.

I’m not sure where all this will go, but I’m holding to my boundaries and moving forward with some pretty big goals my new husband and I have for our nonprofit (which helps people in life transitions who don’t have support… lemon into lemonade).

Thanks for the support, and I know this update is vague, but if I typed out the WHOLE story, it would be a dissertation. It is so unbearably complicated and honestly confusing because of the delulu thinking of my toxic family.

I haven’t blocked anyone because I just can’t bring myself to do that to my family, but I moved an hour away from them and only respond when I’m ready to. I will hold up my boundaries, but my focus is on my family and our NEW BABY!! I just found out I’m 5 weeks pregnant!! It’s sad that my parents and siblings are going to miss out on a relationship with my two youngest because they can’t let go of the life I rejected, but I know I’m a cycle breaker, and with that comes being the villain. A title I will happily wear.

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP on her father's CPA (Certified Public Accountant) and he should see how much he is losing in the process**

> **OOP:** He has a CPA it’s his brother in law. When I mentioned my non profit and how trust accounts work my dad said “that sounds illegal” 🫣 All I said was I was putting my business into a trust to protect it and paying myself through the trust. This makes me think my uncle isn’t the best but who knows. My uncle is not my CPA.

**Commenter 1:** Honestly your family sounds like a cult and they are just mad you broke free from the cult and therefore their control. Time for absolute no contact with them and going to a good family lawyer in your area to petition for child support with proof of the fraud.

> **OOP:** I said it feels like I left a cult or Scientology, because my mom and sister keep tabs with me online since I use it to leverage my businesses and gossip to my brother about it.

**How many kids does OOP have?**

> **OOP:** I actually have 5 kids. 4 bio and 1 step.

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/s/78VT3mbbZu) **March 15, 2025 (same day, one hour later)**

OMG one more update that I discovered in therapy! I know y’all will appreciate this! (Btw Charlotte, I’m southern and I LOVE when you use your southern accent! If you read any of these posts please use it!)

While I was going through my divorce, my brother and his wife were renting a house from my dad. I was at their house one day (we used to be very close) and I noticed the house next door was getting ready for an estate sale. Since I know my dad likes buying houses in that neighborhood I went to check it out. My dad has done rentals my entire life so I’m pretty good at feeling out the bones of a house.

Well I told him and my mom about it and suggested he get it, let me and my kids live there while I help him fix it up. It really just needed some painting and some minor kitchen modernizing. It’s a 3BD/2BA and the same layout as my brother’s house. With this plan I could get out of his house because at the time I was living with them and it was tense for everyone!

I feel like my dad really missed a huge opportunity to help me start my own real estate hustle and teach me to do what he is doing. He could have helped me get back on my feet and set my kids up for life!! Once this realization hit me it was like I saw my dad in a completely different light. I don’t even think he realizes how full of hot air he is.

It seems we wanted me subservient and not to have independence. I think he thought if my life was as hard as possible I would go back to my ex and shame would have been lift from my family, but I would have walked to hell and back before I did that.

**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**

**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**"
Elon Musk is shredding America’s government like he did Twitter,"JUST PAST midnight on February 3rd, Elon Musk appeared on X to explain what he is doing to the federal government. He had to speak over the patter of his four-year-old son, also called X. The bureaucracy, Mr Musk argued, constitutes “a fourth branch of government” which is “arguably the most powerful branch.” He then came to the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which he denounced as little more than a device to funnel taxpayers’ money to Marxists and criminals. He had, he claimed, the full support of Donald Trump and is “shutting it down”, notwithstanding that the agency’s existence is mandated by Congress. Later he posted that he had spent the weekend “feeding USAID into the woodchipper”.

Even as Mr Musk was speaking, workers at USAID’s headquarters in Washington were being told not to come in the next day. Some 600 of the agency’s staff seem to have been locked out of their emails. That followed a weekend in which the agency’s website went offline; its X feed was deleted; and workers from Mr. Musk’s new government unit, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, reportedly tried to enter the agency and were initially stopped by senior staff from downloading classified data. Later on February 3rd Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, announced he had been made acting head of the agency while it faces “reorganisation”.

The takedown of USAID is the most dramatic example of what seems to be Mr. Musk’s plan for the whole of government. It is drawn from his playbook as a corporate boss. Just over two years ago Mr. Musk took over Twitter in a messy $44bn deal. Within a few months, much of which he spent at the company’s headquarters in San Francisco, he had reduced headcount by around four-fifths. A third of the staff accepted buyouts; many of the rest were fired. They included senior executives who were sacked instantly to stop their stock options vesting. Every decision, such as those about which Twitter accounts to ban, was put directly into Mr. Musk’s hands.

Now he is trying to do the same thing with over 2m federal employees, in an attempt to cut $1trn—more than half of all discretionary spending—out of the federal budget. It is, says Donald Kettl, of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, like nothing that has ever happened before. “On a scale of one to ten, this is about 145. It’s so far off the charts,” he says. Richard Nixon was the most recent American president to govern as if the laws of the land did not apply to him, but “this is far beyond anything that Nixon even attempted”.

The first hints of Mr. Musk’s seriousness came on January 28th, when more than 2m federal employees were sent an email by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the closest thing the government has to a human-resources department. The message offered “deferred resignation”. It had the subject line “fork in the road”, the same as in the email sent to Twitter employees when Mr. Musk took over there. Lots of federal employees have been sent two more emails affirming the offer since. One went out to air-traffic controllers less than a day after a plane crash in Washington, DC, which has raised questions about short-staffing at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.

DOGE is technically embedded in the US Digital Service, an organisation created by Barack Obama to spread the use of new technology across government. But DOGE seems to be an entirely new thing. Many of its employees seem to be junior workers pulled in very recently from Mr. Musk’s many private firms. Their names have not been made public. But *Wired*, a magazine, has identified six engineers now working with DOGE. The one who sent the email shutting down USAID, Gavin Kliger, graduated from high school in 2017. The youngest of the six, Edward Coristine, is 19; his relevant work experience consists of a few months interning at Neuralink, Mr. Musk’s brain-implant firm. On his now-deleted LinkedIn profile, he took the moniker “bigballs”.

These engineers—and it is unclear how many more there may be—now seem to be able to enter just about any government building they like. They have apparently installed sofa beds in the office of the OPM. Under an executive order that Mr Trump signed on his first day in office, they are promised “full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems.” Some DOGE workers may also have been issued interim “Top Secret” clearances, which would allow them access to classified data.

Government employees in various agencies report that staffers from DOGE are turning up at their offices, plugging in servers and running “code reviews”. In the past week many government websites have gone offline, including vital ones, like that of the Census Bureau. Services like the passport-application website also disappeared. This may be linked to the purging of all “DEIA”-related material. What the DOGE people seem most keen on is access to personnel records and as much information as possible about what employees actually do. According to one civil servant interviewed by DOGE personnel, the questions include, “Which of your colleagues are most expendable?”

Here, too, Mr. Musk seems to be applying lessons from his takeover of Twitter, where a small group of trusted acolytes combed through records such as the company’s Slack channels and email accounts to decide whom to fire. Yet the federal government is a much larger beast than Twitter, which at its peak had just 6,500 workers. And Mr. Musk has been touching some extremely sensitive parts of it. On January 31st it emerged that David Lebryk, a senior career Treasury official, retired after clashing with officials from DOGE. They may have obtained access to the government payments system, which pays the government’s bills and makes almost 90% of its bank transfers.

Mr. Musk suggested in a tweet that he has direct control, claiming that his team is “rapidly shutting down” government payments to contractors. On his midnight X talk, he claimed that a large share of government spending is being stolen by charities. Already some with government contracts—to ferry elderly patients to medical appointments, for example—report that payments they expected have not turned up.

He had to speak over the patter of his four-year-old son, also called X. The bureaucracy, Mr Musk argued, constitutes “a fourth branch of government” which is “arguably the most powerful branch.” He then came to the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which he denounced as little more than a device to funnel taxpayers’ money to Marxists and criminals. He had, he claimed, the full support of Donald Trump and is “shutting it down”, notwithstanding that the agency’s existence is mandated by Congress. Later he posted that he had spent the weekend “feeding USAID into the woodchipper”.

Even as Mr Musk was speaking, workers at USAID’s headquarters in Washington were being told not to come in the next day. Some 600 of the agency’s staff seem to have been locked out of their emails. That followed a weekend in which the agency’s website went offline; its X feed was deleted; and workers from Mr. Musk’s new government unit, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, reportedly tried to enter the agency and were initially stopped by senior staff from downloading classified data. Later on February 3rd Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, announced he had been made acting head of the agency while it faces “reorganisation”.

The takedown of USAID is the most dramatic example of what seems to be Mr. Musk’s plan for the whole of government. It is drawn from his playbook as a corporate boss. Just over two years ago Mr. Musk took over Twitter in a messy $44bn deal. Within a few months, much of which he spent at the company’s headquarters in San Francisco, he had reduced headcount by around four-fifths. A third of the staff accepted buyouts; many of the rest were fired. They included senior executives who were sacked instantly to stop their stock options vesting. Every decision, such as those about which Twitter accounts to ban, was put directly into Mr. Musk’s hands.

Now he is trying to do the same thing with over 2m federal employees, in an attempt to cut $1trn—more than half of all discretionary spending—out of the federal budget. It is, says Donald Kettl, of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, like nothing that has ever happened before. “On a scale of one to ten, this is about 145. It’s so far off the charts,” he says. Richard Nixon was the most recent American president to govern as if the laws of the land did not apply to him, but “this is far beyond anything that Nixon even attempted”.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/wsEOHLyVYK)  **Apr 27, 2024** 

Throwaway account as my husband and In-laws are follow my main. I, 29 F, have been married to my husband, 30 m, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I met in college during our freshman year. We started off as just friends, and got married seven months ago. I've gotten along with his family, but we aren't super close but we're friendly enough. The problem is that Alex has begun to make me incredibly uncomfortable. 

Firstly, he's begun to ask me who I'm meeting with, where, what we plan on doing, how long every single time I leave the house without him. At first, I just thought he was being protective and a good partner just in case something happened, but then he started checking my phone after the visits, vetting and researching each of my friends as well. 

He also has been pursuing me to link my bank account to his, as he's ""in charge"" of the finances when he was perfectly fine with keeping them separate before. We fight about it almost every day. 

Finally, yesterday when he was preparing to go on a work trip for two weeks in California, he demanded I wear a tracker so he could keep and eye on me while he's gone. I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm suffocating and his family who I've spoken to about his worrying behavior just said he's being careful and protective as a good husband should. I need to gather my things together and find a way to be gone before he gets home without tipping him off. 

He's always threatened that if he ever found me cheating on him he'd turn in divorce papers the same day. He keeps a filled out copy in his desk. I'm going to submit those the day I leave. But there's so much to do, bergen finding a new place to live, seeing if my job has any transfers available, packing and moving in two weeks. His return flight  May 11th, so I need to move quickly. I'm posting here because I don't have any close family, and I can't risk dragging my friends into this as we share the same friends.I just needed a place to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice on the easiest and safest way to do this? 

Edit: oh my god you guys are amazing! I never even thought to not use his divorce papers. I'll check for cameras before I start any packing or prepping. I may also shred his divorce papers just in case and look into getting a lawyer for myself. I'm in a no fault divorce state, that much I so remember which will help. I'll update again when I know more. The tracker he wants me to use is a small clip to put on the belt or waistband. I'll wear it unless I'm going or doing something related to me leaving. No pets yet thankfully.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/v6qRzYi8XD)  **Apr 28, 2024** 

So I've gotten a lot of support and helpful advice along with questions I thought I should clarify before I proceed with the update. Some asked why I'd be 'hiding' things from Alex regarding going out and who I'm meeting with. I don't, and I have nothing to hide. However when he begins to then double check everything I tell him with the other people there right down to each person I talked to and what I said. Did I send any text msgs, did I order food, how much did I eat, that's when it started to feel like I was slowly being pushed into a corner. It didn't start that bad, but gradually grew worse overtime. 

All of the Reddit subs my in-law's families are part of are related gardening and diy so I highly doubt they'll see this, if so by the time they do, I'll hopefully be gone. I talked to my job and explained things to my manager. And they promised to look into openings in other states to see if they could get me into one. They'll have an update on that in three days. I trust that my bank account us secured, considering he's tried to get into it before and failed. I found one camera in the kitchen, another in the living room and one in our bedroom. As such, I've left them in place for now and done all other planning, either in the bathroom pretending I'm taking a bath. 

I'm honestly staying away from the domestic violence services as my sister-in-law is unfortunately higher up in those considering she volunteers there and I have a feeling if I did show up there, they would know in a heartbeat. I can't look for apartments until I get the update from my work, but either or i'm still gonna be leaving the state. The day before I do I will be changing my number carrier and wiping my laptop and all of his electronics before I do. 

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him. 

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job. 

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time. 

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2hLOsd7Kbg)  **Apr 30, 2024** 

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL  to show me his favorite recipes. 

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm. 

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind. 

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in. 

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/AXTZmkIqAB)  **May 7, 2024** 

Update 3: I have 2 weeks to get away from my husband. 

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left. 

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through. 

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this. 

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.


[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/F2jysvg8bc)  **May 14, 2024** 

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him. 

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex. 

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess. 

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.  

##**NEW UPDATE**
* 

[Update on leaving](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/958o4qYgbB)  **May 26, 2024** 

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change. 

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in. 

The responses I got from the emails varied. His family said I was overreacting, and that I owe Alex an apology for the problems this has caused him. The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild. As much as I want to say I was surprised by the lack of support, I’m honestly not. 

He intends to fight the divorce. I am letting my lawyer handle it, and I am also pursuing a protective order as well. Once I got approved for my apartment, I also froze my credit. I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA. 

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage. 

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water.

That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him. 

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job. 

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time. 

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2hLOsd7Kbg)  **Apr 30, 2024** 

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL  to show me his favorite recipes. 

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm. 

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind. 

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in. 

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/AXTZmkIqAB)  **May 7, 2024** 

Update 3: I have 2 weeks to get away from my husband. 

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left. 

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through. 

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this. 

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.


[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/F2jysvg8bc)  **May 14, 2024** 

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him. 

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex. 

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess. 

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.  

##**NEW UPDATE**

[Update on leaving](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/958o4qYgbB)  **May 26, 2024** 

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change. 

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in. 

The responses I got from the emails varied. His family said I was overreacting, and that I owe Alex an apology for the problems this has caused him. The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild. As much as I want to say I was surprised by the lack of support, I’m honestly not. 

He intends to fight the divorce. I am letting my lawyer handle it, and I am also pursuing a protective order as well. Once I got approved for my apartment, I also froze my credit. I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA. 

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage. 

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water.

The HOA President's Long Goodbye,"Posting on behalf of a friend who isn't on reddit. This is for you, Jake!

-------

When I moved into my suburban neighborhood, I expected peace and quiet. Instead, I walked into a petty dictatorship run by our HOA president, Todd. Todd was the worst kind of leader: the kind who loved power but hated accountability. He enforced ridiculous rules—like fining people $200 for leaving their trash cans out a minute past 9:00 AM—but blatantly ignored the rules when it suited him. His own yard was a mess of unpermitted structures, and his fence was taller than allowed by city ordinances. But Todd's true sin? Using the HOA as his personal piggy bank.

At first, I tried reasoning with him. My fence was slightly off-color because the approved stain wasn’t available, and he fined me $500. I explained, provided receipts, and asked for leniency. Todd smirked, said, “Rules are rules,” and walked away. That’s when I decided I would take him down—not with screaming or public arguments, but methodically, legally, and in a way he’d never recover from.

---

### **Step One: Become the Inside Man**  
Todd’s first mistake was underestimating me. I volunteered for the HOA board under the guise of wanting to ""get involved in the community."" I played the part of the eager, naïve newbie perfectly. For two years, I attended every meeting, quietly observing how Todd operated. I learned he controlled the board by bullying other members and burying them in paperwork. He’d push through votes when only his allies were present and conveniently “lose” paperwork submitted by dissenting homeowners. 

I kept my head down, took detailed notes, and waited. My goal was to outlast his term as president so I could begin making changes. Then I discovered Todd’s second mistake: he wasn’t just a bully; he was a thief.

---

### **Step Two: Follow the Money**  
Todd loved to brag about how he kept the HOA’s finances in order. But something didn’t add up. The annual HOA fees were high—much higher than in similar neighborhoods—but the common areas were falling apart. The pool was closed half the summer due to ""maintenance issues,"" and the landscaping looked like it hadn’t been touched in months.

I started digging. As the HOA treasurer, Todd had access to all the accounts, but he was notoriously cagey about sharing financial details. I asked for the budget during a meeting, and Todd laughed it off, saying, “Don’t worry, I’ve got it under control.” I filed a formal request for the financial records, which, under HOA rules, he was required to provide. Weeks went by with no response. That’s when I started talking to neighbors.

Turns out, I wasn’t the only one suspicious. Over a dozen homeowners had requested access to the budget over the years, only to be ignored. One neighbor claimed Todd had used HOA funds to install a new patio at his house, while another swore he’d seen Todd’s kids at the community pool during its ""maintenance closure."" Armed with these suspicions, I filed a formal complaint with the HOA board, forcing Todd to provide the records. He stalled, but I wasn’t backing down.

---

### **Step Three: Build the Case**  
When Todd finally handed over the financial documents, they were a mess. Invoices were missing, payments were mislabeled, and some expenses were downright bizarre. A $15,000 “landscaping fee” paid to a company that didn’t exist. Thousands spent on “administrative costs” with no explanation. I cross-referenced the HOA’s bank statements with public records and found the smoking gun: Todd was funneling money to his personal accounts. 

Even better, I discovered Todd had been inflating contractor fees, pocketing the difference, and splitting the profits with his buddy, a shady contractor who “handled” most of the HOA’s maintenance. I compiled everything into a detailed report, complete with spreadsheets, photos, and notarized statements from neighbors who had seen Todd's antics firsthand.

---

### **Step Four: The Coup**  
I waited for the annual HOA meeting, which was typically a snooze fest attended by only a handful of homeowners. But this time, I made sure people showed up. I spent weeks knocking on doors, explaining what Todd had been up to. I didn’t share everything—just enough to get people angry and curious. On the night of the meeting, the room was packed.

Todd started the meeting like usual, droning on about how “difficult” it was to manage the HOA and how much he’d sacrificed for the community. That’s when I stood up. I calmly asked if he could explain some discrepancies in the budget. Todd laughed nervously and said, “I don’t think this is the time or place.” I replied, “Actually, Todd, it’s the perfect time.” 

I handed out copies of my report to everyone in the room. The mood shifted instantly. People started reading, whispering, and then shouting. Todd tried to regain control, but it was too late. I called for a vote to remove him as president. By the end of the night, Todd was out.

---

### **Step Five: The Final Blow**  
After Todd was removed, we hired an independent auditor to go through the HOA’s finances. They confirmed everything: Todd had embezzled over $50,000, mismanaged tens of thousands more, and committed multiple counts of fraud. We reported him to the police and filed a civil lawsuit to recover the stolen funds.

But it didn’t end there. Todd’s shady contractor buddy was also exposed and banned from doing business in the county. Todd had to sell his house to pay restitution and legal fees. His name became a running joke in the neighborhood, and no one would touch him professionally. 

With Todd gone, we restructured the HOA to prevent another dictator from taking over. We implemented term limits, required multiple board members to approve financial decisions, and created an online portal so all homeowners could access budgets and meeting minutes.

---

### **The Aftermath**  
Every time I walk past Todd’s old house, now owned by a lovely family, I smile. The pool is open, the landscaping is beautiful, and the HOA fees are lower than ever. Todd, meanwhile, moved to a neighboring town, where he reportedly tried to join another HOA board—only to be laughed out of the room when someone Googled his name.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/wsEOHLyVYK)  **Apr 27, 2024** 

Throwaway account as my husband and In-laws are follow my main. I, 29 F, have been married to my husband, 30 m, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I met in college during our freshman year. We started off as just friends, and got married seven months ago. I've gotten along with his family, but we aren't super close but we're friendly enough. The problem is that Alex has begun to make me incredibly uncomfortable. 

Firstly, he's begun to ask me who I'm meeting with, where, what we plan on doing, how long every single time I leave the house without him. At first, I just thought he was being protective and a good partner just in case something happened, but then he started checking my phone after the visits, vetting and researching each of my friends as well. 

He also has been pursuing me to link my bank account to his, as he's ""in charge"" of the finances when he was perfectly fine with keeping them separate before. We fight about it almost every day. 

Finally, yesterday when he was preparing to go on a work trip for two weeks in California, he demanded I wear a tracker so he could keep and eye on me while he's gone. I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm suffocating and his family who I've spoken to about his worrying behavior just said he's being careful and protective as a good husband should. I need to gather my things together and find a way to be gone before he gets home without tipping him off. 

He's always threatened that if he ever found me cheating on him he'd turn in divorce papers the same day. He keeps a filled out copy in his desk. I'm going to submit those the day I leave. But there's so much to do, bergen finding a new place to live, seeing if my job has any transfers available, packing and moving in two weeks. His return flight  May 11th, so I need to move quickly. I'm posting here because I don't have any close family, and I can't risk dragging my friends into this as we share the same friends.I just needed a place to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice on the easiest and safest way to do this? 

Edit: oh my god you guys are amazing! I never even thought to not use his divorce papers. I'll check for cameras before I start any packing or prepping. I may also shred his divorce papers just in case and look into getting a lawyer for myself. I'm in a no fault divorce state, that much I so remember which will help. I'll update again when I know more. The tracker he wants me to use is a small clip to put on the belt or waistband. I'll wear it unless I'm going or doing something related to me leaving. No pets yet thankfully.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/v6qRzYi8XD)  **Apr 28, 2024** 

So I've gotten a lot of support and helpful advice along with questions I thought I should clarify before I proceed with the update. Some asked why I'd be 'hiding' things from Alex regarding going out and who I'm meeting with. I don't, and I have nothing to hide. However when he begins to then double check everything I tell him with the other people there right down to each person I talked to and what I said. Did I send any text msgs, did I order food, how much did I eat, that's when it started to feel like I was slowly being pushed into a corner. It didn't start that bad, but gradually grew worse overtime. 

All of the Reddit subs my in-law's families are part of are related gardening and diy so I highly doubt they'll see this, if so by the time they do, I'll hopefully be gone. I talked to my job and explained things to my manager. And they promised to look into openings in other states to see if they could get me into one. They'll have an update on that in three days. I trust that my bank account us secured, considering he's tried to get into it before and failed. I found one camera in the kitchen, another in the living room and one in our bedroom. As such, I've left them in place for now and done all other planning, either in the bathroom pretending I'm taking a bath. 

I'm honestly staying away from the domestic violence services as my sister-in-law is unfortunately higher up in those considering she volunteers there and I have a feeling if I did show up there, they would know in a heartbeat. I can't look for apartments until I get the update from my work, but either or i'm still gonna be leaving the state. The day before I do I will be changing my number carrier and wiping my laptop and all of his electronics before I do. 

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him. 

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job. 

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time. 

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2hLOsd7Kbg)  **Apr 30, 2024** 

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL  to show me his favorite recipes. 

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm. 

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind. 

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in. 

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/AXTZmkIqAB)  **May 7, 2024** 

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left. 

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through. 

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this. 

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.


[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/F2jysvg8bc)  **May 14, 2024** 

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him. 

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex. 

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess. 

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.   

[Update on leaving](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/958o4qYgbB)  **May 26, 2024** 

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change. 

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in. 

The responses I got from the emails varied. His family said I was overreacting, and that I owe Alex an apology for the problems this has caused him. The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild. As much as I want to say I was surprised by the lack of support, I’m honestly not. 

He intends to fight the divorce. I am letting my lawyer handle it, and I am also pursuing a protective order as well. Once I got approved for my apartment, I also froze my credit. I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA. 

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage. 

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water.  

[Another Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/78UYNmEZUt)  **June 25, 2024** 

It’s been a month since my previous update, and I wanted to share some of what’s been going on in the meantime. The divorce is proceeding, but even though I don’t need him to agree – and he’s not – it means I have to go through the courts to get it approved. As such, it could be upwards of six months to push it through even though I’m filing without attempting to claim property, alimony or compensation. I just want a clean break and separation. 

Alex has attempted to use our friends to reach out to me, as he doesn’t want to use my lawyer for communication. He’s saying its disrespectful and cowardly to hide behind my lawyer and not meet him face to face. Alex wrote me a letter that he did pass off to my lawyer, but the contents were him justifying his actions and claiming that in today's time it is dangerous for women to be on their own which is why he was so intent on trying to keep me safe from harm. He wanted me to understand that he was trying to protect me as best he could and was hurt that I would just lie to him and hide my actions from him related to my dissatisfaction with our marriage and my moving. 

I didn’t reply, because at no point did he apologize. All he did was turn everything around on me as I was being overly dramatic, emotional and cowardly. There was a second letter with Alex’s from my SIL. Her letter… was honestly disturbing and completely justified my misgivings regarding approaching her in any kind of professional capacity. She spent five paragraphs detailing how a ‘real abusive’ relationship looked like and that Alex was the furthest thing from abusive. The details she included were all related to financial abuse and physical abuse. Nothing like what Alex had been doing. She stated that my attempts to smear her brother’s name for attention and clout made me the abuser not him. 

I haven’t really been able to process that admittedly. Part of me can’t help but wonder if she’s right. I mean, I blindsided him by leaving as I did and am refusing to speak with him at all. My old boss recommended that I look into getting into therapy after I moved, and I think I need to. I have had a hard time adjusting to being on my own, I keep censoring myself and haven’t even gone out to eat yet. I always end up worrying about what if someone sees me, what if I get in trouble for spending my money on something frivolous… 

My lawyer is continuing to fight for the divorce, and I shouldn’t need to be physically present in court. Any meetings needed between me and the judge can be done via zoom. I’m trying to avoid confrontation with Alex and his family for now as much as I can and passed both letters to my lawyer in case he needs them. Our friends are mostly trying to avoid taking sides still, and I’m honestly approaching the point of just letting them go as well. I’m tired of fighting for them to understand at this point. I don’t know if anything is going to happen, so my next update may not be until around mid-November depending on how long it takes to push the divorce through. Work is going well, and it’s helpful to have something familiar to anchor my day to day life when so much has changed and is changing even now. 

##**NEW UPDATE**
* 

[Divorce Proceeding Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/kYSL43wzq7)  **Oct 17, 2024** 

It’s been a while since I last updated, as I needed to let the court step in as Alex was not willing to grant my request for a divorce. We started with mediated session via zoom, but after four sessions it was decided that no compromise could be reached between us. The things Alex was pushing for were one’s I’m not even willing to humor let alone agree to. He wanted me to tell our friends and those I’d sent the information to about his actions that I’d made it up in order to gain sympathy. He also wanted me to pay him for defamation and suffering, especially the wages he lost because of sitting in jail for two days and missing work before getting bailed out. Lastly, he also wanted me to return and to quote him ‘stop my foolish behavior and act like a proper wife and partner.’ 

Yeah no. 

So, needless to say, our ‘mediated’ sessions went absolutely nowhere. The judge isn’t seeming to buy into Alex’s act thankfully, because he’s certainly tried. It took me far too long to see Alex for who he was, and part of me feels like an idiot because I didn’t see it at all. Yet, the judge seemed to clock him for exactly what he is within the first meeting. Maybe I just didn’t want to see it. I don’t know. Alex ended up arguing with the Judge a LOT, even being held in contempt four different times. I think it's honestly why this moved as quick as it did. It didn't help that Alex tried to pull in his family as character witnesses but they were dismissed by the Judge as the 'abuse wasn't seen or heard by them, and as such, they only knew part of Alex's character.' In his closing statement after he approved the divorce, he went on to call Alex a narcissist and that if Alex loved himself so much to abuse the one he'd married to let the divorce happen and marry a mirror next. I didn't think a Judge was allowed to say that. At all. But my lawyer just shook his head and told me not to say anything so we left. 

So here’s the update I’m sure everyone’s been hoping for and guessed: I’m officially divorced. The documents were processed three days ago, and I’m still in disbelief. I have no contact with Alex any longer, nor do I want any. I’m not going to give our friends my new contact information. I may not have replied to everyone, though I tried, but I did read all of your comments. I really did. Your repeated statements about how they weren’t actually friends really helped me see that they *weren’t*. So, I decided that since I moved far from that place, I needed to start over. New home, new place, new friends. It’s slow, and I’ve started therapy though it took almost three months to get it due to the usual wait times but I’ve been going three times a week ever since. It’s helping, even with things I thought were done and dusted. 

Alex didn’t take the divorce well according to my lawyer who’s been keeping up with him to make sure he stays away from me. He did something at work, I don’t know what as obviously I have no way to gain that information, but whatever it was cost him his job. My lawyer also did something I didn’t expect him to, but something I think everyone will like – He took the letter my ex-sil sent me and forwarded it to the domestic violence organization she works for along with an formal statement regarding Alex, his actions, and the decision of the Judge. She’s been let go as well, and given how tight those organizations are with one another, my lawyer said that the likely hood of her getting a position at another is slim to none. I actually laughed, though I was a bit teary, when he said that and that ‘slim is on a leaky rowboat to China.’ 

I’ve been crying a lot lately, but my therapist says it’s normal and shows I’m actually processing things instead of bottling them up and pushing them down. I’ll try to update in a month or so, if my emotions level out some, to explain a few more of the details but I wanted to get this out there, and thank everyone for their continued support and encouragement. I appreciate each and every one of you. I really do. You gave me the hope that leaving him wasn’t going to be this giant black mark I’d never heal from or move on from. Work is going well, and the sense of normality and routine is helping me avoid feeling like everything has been spiraling out of control.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/wsEOHLyVYK)  **Apr 27, 2024** 

Throwaway account as my husband and In-laws are follow my main. I, 29 F, have been married to my husband, 30 m, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I met in college during our freshman year. We started off as just friends, and got married seven months ago. I've gotten along with his family, but we aren't super close but we're friendly enough. The problem is that Alex has begun to make me incredibly uncomfortable. 

Firstly, he's begun to ask me who I'm meeting with, where, what we plan on doing, how long every single time I leave the house without him. At first, I just thought he was being protective and a good partner just in case something happened, but then he started checking my phone after the visits, vetting and researching each of my friends as well. 

He also has been pursuing me to link my bank account to his, as he's ""in charge"" of the finances when he was perfectly fine with keeping them separate before. We fight about it almost every day. 

Finally, yesterday when he was preparing to go on a work trip for two weeks in California, he demanded I wear a tracker so he could keep and eye on me while he's gone. I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm suffocating and his family who I've spoken to about his worrying behavior just said he's being careful and protective as a good husband should. I need to gather my things together and find a way to be gone before he gets home without tipping him off. 

He's always threatened that if he ever found me cheating on him he'd turn in divorce papers the same day. He keeps a filled out copy in his desk. I'm going to submit those the day I leave. But there's so much to do, bergen finding a new place to live, seeing if my job has any transfers available, packing and moving in two weeks. His return flight  May 11th, so I need to move quickly. I'm posting here because I don't have any close family, and I can't risk dragging my friends into this as we share the same friends.I just needed a place to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice on the easiest and safest way to do this? 

Edit: oh my god you guys are amazing! I never even thought to not use his divorce papers. I'll check for cameras before I start any packing or prepping. I may also shred his divorce papers just in case and look into getting a lawyer for myself. I'm in a no fault divorce state, that much I so remember which will help. I'll update again when I know more. The tracker he wants me to use is a small clip to put on the belt or waistband. I'll wear it unless I'm going or doing something related to me leaving. No pets yet thankfully.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/v6qRzYi8XD)  **Apr 28, 2024** 

So I've gotten a lot of support and helpful advice along with questions I thought I should clarify before I proceed with the update. Some asked why I'd be 'hiding' things from Alex regarding going out and who I'm meeting with. I don't, and I have nothing to hide. However when he begins to then double check everything I tell him with the other people there right down to each person I talked to and what I said. Did I send any text msgs, did I order food, how much did I eat, that's when it started to feel like I was slowly being pushed into a corner. It didn't start that bad, but gradually grew worse overtime. 

All of the Reddit subs my in-law's families are part of are related gardening and diy so I highly doubt they'll see this, if so by the time they do, I'll hopefully be gone. I talked to my job and explained things to my manager. And they promised to look into openings in other states to see if they could get me into one. They'll have an update on that in three days. I trust that my bank account us secured, considering he's tried to get into it before and failed. I found one camera in the kitchen, another in the living room and one in our bedroom. As such, I've left them in place for now and done all other planning, either in the bathroom pretending I'm taking a bath. 

I'm honestly staying away from the domestic violence services as my sister-in-law is unfortunately higher up in those considering she volunteers there and I have a feeling if I did show up there, they would know in a heartbeat. I can't look for apartments until I get the update from my work, but either or i'm still gonna be leaving the state. The day before I do I will be changing my number carrier and wiping my laptop and all of his electronics before I do. 

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him. 

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job. 

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time. 

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2hLOsd7Kbg)  **Apr 30, 2024** 

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL  to show me his favorite recipes. 

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm. 

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind. 

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in. 

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/AXTZmkIqAB)  **May 7, 2024**

[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/F2jysvg8bc)  **May 14, 2024** 

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question.

[Update on leaving](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/958o4qYgbB)  **May 26, 2024** 

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change. 

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in.

The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild.

I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA. 

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage. 

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water.  

[Another Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/78UYNmEZUt)  **June 25, 2024** 

It’s been a month since my previous update, and I wanted to share some of what’s been going on in the meantime. The divorce is proceeding, but even though I don’t need him to agree – and he’s not – it means I have to go through the courts to get it approved. As such, it could be upwards of six months to push it through even though I’m filing without attempting to claim property, alimony or compensation. I just want a clean break and separation. 

Alex has attempted to use our friends to reach out to me, as he doesn’t want to use my lawyer for communication. He’s saying its disrespectful and cowardly to hide behind my lawyer and not meet him face to face. Alex wrote me a letter that he did pass off to my lawyer, but the contents were him justifying his actions and claiming that in today's time it is dangerous for women to be on their own which is why he was so intent on trying to keep me safe from harm. He wanted me to understand that he was trying to protect me as best he could and was hurt that I would just lie to him and hide my actions from him related to my dissatisfaction with our marriage and my moving. 

I didn’t reply, because at no point did he apologize. All he did was turn everything around on me as I was being overly dramatic, emotional and cowardly. There was a second letter with Alex’s from my SIL. Her letter… was honestly disturbing and completely justified my misgivings regarding approaching her in any kind of professional capacity. She spent five paragraphs detailing how a ‘real abusive’ relationship looked like and that Alex was the furthest thing from abusive. The details she included were all related to financial abuse and physical abuse. Nothing like what Alex had been doing. She stated that my attempts to smear her brother’s name for attention and clout made me the abuser not him. 

I haven’t really been able to process that admittedly. Part of me can’t help but wonder if she’s right. I mean, I blindsided him by leaving as I did and am refusing to speak with him at all. My old boss recommended that I look into getting into therapy after I moved, and I think I need to. I have had a hard time adjusting to being on my own, I keep censoring myself and haven’t even gone out to eat yet. I always end up worrying about what if someone sees me, what if I get in trouble for spending my money on something frivolous… 

My lawyer is continuing to fight for the divorce, and I shouldn’t need to be physically present in court. Any meetings needed between me and the judge can be done via zoom. I’m trying to avoid confrontation with Alex and his family for now as much as I can and passed both letters to my lawyer in case he needs them. Our friends are mostly trying to avoid taking sides still, and I’m honestly approaching the point of just letting them go as well. I’m tired of fighting for them to understand at this point. I don’t know if anything is going to happen, so my next update may not be until around mid-November depending on how long it takes to push the divorce through. Work is going well, and it’s helpful to have something familiar to anchor my day to day life when so much has changed and is changing even now. 

##**NEW UPDATE**
* 

[Divorce Proceeding Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/kYSL43wzq7)  **Oct 17, 2024** 

It’s been a while since I last updated, as I needed to let the court step in as Alex was not willing to grant my request for a divorce. We started with mediated session via zoom, but after four sessions it was decided that no compromise could be reached between us. The things Alex was pushing for were one’s I’m not even willing to humor let alone agree to. He wanted me to tell our friends and those I’d sent the information to about his actions that I’d made it up in order to gain sympathy. He also wanted me to pay him for defamation and suffering, especially the wages he lost because of sitting in jail for two days and missing work before getting bailed out. Lastly, he also wanted me to return and to quote him ‘stop my foolish behavior and act like a proper wife and partner.’ 

Yeah no. 

So, needless to say, our ‘mediated’ sessions went absolutely nowhere. The judge isn’t seeming to buy into Alex’s act thankfully, because he’s certainly tried. It took me far too long to see Alex for who he was, and part of me feels like an idiot because I didn’t see it at all. Yet, the judge seemed to clock him for exactly what he is within the first meeting. Maybe I just didn’t want to see it. I don’t know. Alex ended up arguing with the Judge a LOT, even being held in contempt four different times. I think it's honestly why this moved as quick as it did. It didn't help that Alex tried to pull in his family as character witnesses but they were dismissed by the Judge as the 'abuse wasn't seen or heard by them, and as such, they only knew part of Alex's character.' In his closing statement after he approved the divorce, he went on to call Alex a narcissist and that if Alex loved himself so much to abuse the one he'd married to let the divorce happen and marry a mirror next. I didn't think a Judge was allowed to say that. At all. But my lawyer just shook his head and told me not to say anything so we left. 

So here’s the update I’m sure everyone’s been hoping for and guessed: I’m officially divorced. The documents were processed three days ago, and I’m still in disbelief. I have no contact with Alex any longer, nor do I want any. I’m not going to give our friends my new contact information. I may not have replied to everyone, though I tried, but I did read all of your comments. I really did. Your repeated statements about how they weren’t actually friends really helped me see that they *weren’t*. So, I decided that since I moved far from that place, I needed to start over. New home, new place, new friends. It’s slow, and I’ve started therapy though it took almost three months to get it due to the usual wait times but I’ve been going three times a week ever since. It’s helping, even with things I thought were done and dusted. 

Alex didn’t take the divorce well according to my lawyer who’s been keeping up with him to make sure he stays away from me. He did something at work, I don’t know what as obviously I have no way to gain that information, but whatever it was cost him his job. My lawyer also did something I didn’t expect him to, but something I think everyone will like – He took the letter my ex-sil sent me and forwarded it to the domestic violence organization she works for along with an formal statement regarding Alex, his actions, and the decision of the Judge. She’s been let go as well, and given how tight those organizations are with one another, my lawyer said that the likely hood of her getting a position at another is slim to none. I actually laughed, though I was a bit teary, when he said that and that ‘slim is on a leaky rowboat to China.’ 

I’ve been crying a lot lately, but my therapist says it’s normal and shows I’m actually processing things instead of bottling them up and pushing them down. I’ll try to update in a month or so, if my emotions level out some, to explain a few more of the details but I wanted to get this out there, and thank everyone for their continued support and encouragement. I appreciate each and every one of you. I really do. You gave me the hope that leaving him wasn’t going to be this giant black mark I’d never heal from or move on from. Work is going well, and the sense of normality and routine is helping me avoid feeling like everything has been spiraling out of control.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/wsEOHLyVYK)  **Apr 27, 2024**

Throwaway account as my husband and In-laws are follow my main. I, 29 F, have been married to my husband, 30 m, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I met in college during our freshman year. We started off as just friends, and got married seven months ago. I've gotten along with his family, but we aren't super close but we're friendly enough. The problem is that Alex has begun to make me incredibly uncomfortable.

Firstly, he's begun to ask me who I'm meeting with, where, what we plan on doing, how long every single time I leave the house without him. At first, I just thought he was being protective and a good partner just in case something happened, but then he started checking my phone after the visits, vetting and researching each of my friends as well.

He also has been pursuing me to link my bank account to his, as he's ""in charge"" of the finances when he was perfectly fine with keeping them separate before. We fight about it almost every day.

Finally, yesterday when he was preparing to go on a work trip for two weeks in California, he demanded I wear a tracker so he could keep and eye on me while he's gone. I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm suffocating and his family who I've spoken to about his worrying behavior just said he's being careful and protective as a good husband should. I need to gather my things together and find a way to be gone before he gets home without tipping him off.

He's always threatened that if he ever found me cheating on him he'd turn in divorce papers the same day. He keeps a filled out copy in his desk. I'm going to submit those the day I leave. But there's so much to do, bergen finding a new place to live, seeing if my job has any transfers available, packing and moving in two weeks. His return flight  May 11th, so I need to move quickly. I'm posting here because I don't have any close family, and I can't risk dragging my friends into this as we share the same friends.I just needed a place to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice on the easiest and safest way to do this?

Edit: oh my god you guys are amazing! I never even thought to not use his divorce papers. I'll check for cameras before I start any packing or prepping. I may also shred his divorce papers just in case and look into getting a lawyer for myself. I'm in a no fault divorce state, that much I so remember which will help. I'll update again when I know more. The tracker he wants me to use is a small clip to put on the belt or waistband. I'll wear it unless I'm going or doing something related to me leaving. No pets yet thankfully.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/v6qRzYi8XD)  **Apr 28, 2024**

So I've gotten a lot of support and helpful advice along with questions I thought I should clarify before I proceed with the update. Some asked why I'd be 'hiding' things from Alex regarding going out and who I'm meeting with. I don't, and I have nothing to hide. However when he begins to then double check everything I tell him with the other people there right down to each person I talked to and what I said. Did I send any text msgs, did I order food, how much did I eat, that's when it started to feel like I was slowly being pushed into a corner. It didn't start that bad, but gradually grew worse overtime.

All of the Reddit subs my in-law's families are part of are related gardening and diy so I highly doubt they'll see this, if so by the time they do, I'll hopefully be gone. I talked to my job and explained things to my manager. And they promised to look into openings in other states to see if they could get me into one. They'll have an update on that in three days. I trust that my bank account us secured, considering he's tried to get into it before and failed. I found one camera in the kitchen, another in the living room and one in our bedroom. As such, I've left them in place for now and done all other planning, either in the bathroom pretending I'm taking a bath.

I'm honestly staying away from the domestic violence services as my sister-in-law is unfortunately higher up in those considering she volunteers there and I have a feeling if I did show up there, they would know in a heartbeat. I can't look for apartments until I get the update from my work, but either or i'm still gonna be leaving the state. The day before I do I will be changing my number carrier and wiping my laptop and all of his electronics before I do.

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him.

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job.

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time.

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2hLOsd7Kbg)  **Apr 30, 2024**

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL  to show me his favorite recipes.

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm.

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind. 

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in.

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/AXTZmkIqAB)  **May 7, 2024**

Update 3: I have 2 weeks to get away from my husband.

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left. 

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through.

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this.

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.

[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/F2jysvg8bc)  **May 14, 2024** 

Update  4 

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him. 

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex. 

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess. 

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.

I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.

[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/F2jysvg8bc)  **May 14, 2024** 

Update  4 

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him. 

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex. 

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess. 

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.

**Title:** AITAH for refusing to speak to my brother after he attacked me

Repost because it was removed from the AITA sub for mentioning violence. Oops

I feel inclined to share this since I’m getting berated by my extended family.

For context, I’m 21F and he’s 15M. My little brother (Rascal) is a narcissistic menace. As a kid, it was tolerable - I was his older sister, and being the eldest daughter of 5 kids in an ethnic household meant every action of his (and the rest of them) was on me. But as he grew older, he began taking advantage of the fact that I’m the scapegoat of the house, the one no one respects or listens to but is blamed for everything.

The straw that broke the camel’s back was him attacking me 2 weeks ago. He had my wrists on a death grip and I instinctively fought to get him off me. I was dumbfounded and also scared because he attacked me at the top of the stairs, and I was on the verge of falling down. He had a growth spurt last year so is 5’10” to my 5’5”, which perhaps gave him the confidence to manhandle his older sister??

I would’ve left there and then, but it was 10pm at night, with no car & nowhere to go. I woke up the next day with bruises on my wrists and got really upset and angry all over again. I called my uncle to tell him what happened because I didn’t know what else to do. I regret that because whilst he did tear Rascal a new one, he also told him to apologise to me after “she’s had a day to calm down”. Rascal didn’t do that, and I was truly hoping he’d never talk to me again since he didn’t get any punishment anyway, no one held him accountable for his behaviour - he just went straight back to his PS5.

However, my uncle called me back a few days ago and asked if Rascal had apologised yet. I was in my room, assuming no one was around, so I was talking loudly when I said “No, he didn’t apologise, and I don’t want a measly apology that means nothing anyway. He has done this over and over again and I’m tired of the abuse. I’ve done nothing to deserve this.”

Rascal was standing outside my room and heard that uncle was on call with me, and in an attempt to manipulate the situation again he ran, got some leftover snacks from his room and knocked on my door *whilst I was still on call with uncle*

My uncle heard Rascal come into my room & throw the snacks at me whilst saying sorry loudly. I saw red & threw the measly bag back at him, telling him to never speak to me again. My uncle started saying “wait, he apologised?? Why are you screaming, go tell him you accept it.”

I said lol you must be mad and ended the call.

Haven’t talked to uncle since either, I regret even involving him but I had no one to speak to, no friends, and my therapist appointment is in a month.

My cousin called me today: said Uncle told her everything and that I’m a bad sister for not hearing my brother out, that I should talk to him. She said “siblings fight all the time!”

So, AITA for standing my ground and vowing not to speak to him again?

*(I will be moving out and going NC with my mother for other reasons, but this situation has solidified the fact that I also want nothing to do with him and his abuse.)*

**Background** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i2xd1j/aita_for_telling_my_father_he_cannot_tell_me_what/) **2: January 16, 2025**

**Title:** AITA for telling my father he cannot tell me what to do

I’m 21F, and trying to move out. I live in England. It’s been a long process due to some financial issues, but I’m getting there - I have an end goal in mind which is good.

My father does not live with us. He works abroad. Him and my mother are not on good terms but for some reason won’t divorce, just separated. He also has another family which may add context.

I made the mistake of talking about me moving out within earshot of my mother a while ago. Ever since then, she’s been trying to manipulate me, not realising that the curtains have been lifted from my eyes. I see every word for what it is - a power play, an attempt to chain me to a toxic environment that uses me as a scapegoat.

When her final card, telling me to stay because I’m useless and can’t be independent and would be better off saving my money for a car instead of rent and bills, didn’t work on me - she called my dad to talk some ‘sense’ into me.

The call from him was triggering, but I pushed through and said I don’t want to live here. I hate that I’m either being taken advantage of or demeaned. He kept pushing, so in anger I said I hate *her*. That he cannot convince me to stay just to slave away for people who don’t care about me. I said I rather be in debt and pay my rent in money, instead of paying it with my mental health as I’ve done my entire life.

He said “are you refusing to listen to your father?” I said “Maybe you’d have a leg to stand on if you were here, but you’re working abroad, have another family that you don’t even live with either and are probably thinking about. You’ve got enough on your plate so please don’t bother with me now, my decision is set.”

He was furious and called my siblings in anger ranting about me. They’ve not said anything really. My mother then got wind of what I said and has been badgering me ever since to apologise to him. I admit I have been avoiding his calls because I was angry when I said everything. I’m feeling slightly guilty now for causing a rift.

AITA for shutting down my father, arguing with him and telling him he cannot tell me what to do?

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1i9ytmt/i_am_leaving_this_house_i_will_have_no_one_to/)**: January 25, 2025 (9 days after background posts)**

This one is long, please read if you can. I’d love to get some advice and moral support.

In previous posts, I mentioned how chaotic my home life is, [how my brother attacked me](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/IaKlv8ayRi) and how my anger was dismissed. This links to today’s events.

I’m 21F, with a mother that hates her life and therefore projects all her negative emotions onto her children - mainly me. She has the classic victim-mentality narcissistic mindset, spewing the same bullshit about how I am the cause of all her troubles, I am the reason for her behaviour. Refuses to have a civil conversation without screaming at me, has NEVER apologised for anything, has never ever hugged me or told me she loved me. That’s not an exaggeration - NEVER.

Being the eldest daughter, I was blamed for it all. Her behaviour is always my fault according to her. I’m too emotionally drained to give specific context but just know that the “why does my mother hate me?” questions began when I was just a 5 year old little girl.

In the past few years, I had accepted that no amount of begging, pleading or bargaining would give me the loving mother I yearn for. So I decided to protect my emotions from being exploited. I stopped trying to reason with her.

After the incident with my brother, I continued not speaking to anyone. Going about my life outside, coming back here just to sleep. Without the financial independence to move out and no friends to stay with, I thought I had to endure this until I got my money up.

But I’m at the end of my rope. Today, after not speaking to each other for weeks, she came and commanded me to do fill out a long form for her. I said “I’m not ready to act like nothing happened. I was assaulted and nearly thrown off a flight of stairs by your son and you did nothing but watched. And then dismissed me when I broke down in rage. You have ignored me since. If you’re gonna talk to me, then let’s start with what happened that night.”

She began ranting about how everything was my fault. How I’m selfish for expecting her to sort him out when he won’t listen to her. I said “you laughed at me in front of him and told me to stop the dramatics. **In front of him**.” The ranting from her dragged on and I just left to go to my room. She came up after me cussing me out. This is where I lost it and began recording so I have evidence. She yanked my phone and threw it back at me. Then proceeded to continue raging at me.

I made a mistake and said “that’s what you are” as a reply to one of her horrible insults to me. She began hitting me, I tried moving away but she continued - at one point punching my face. Now she is shorter than me, and I’m quite obviously stronger. I could’ve fought back. But regardless of everything, in my heart she’s my mother and I didn’t want to touch her and give her ammunition to use against me. I managed to grab my suitcase and duffel bag which became a shield against her attacks. I went upstairs, hyperventilating and needing to get OUT.

As mentioned in my previous posts, she has tried manipulating me to stay and not leave the house before. But something about today opened my mind - I rather be living in shelters than be here. I packed a bag but all the numbers I called wouldn’t pick up. I’ve been in my room for the past 5 hours, trying to hatch out a plan. I can’t leave if there’s a risk I’ll be forced back because of circumstances. I know because of previous fights in this house that my mother will give me the silent treatment for weeks, so I have time to hash out a plan.

I have no friends. No one to stay with. So on Monday morning, I will take my bag and go to a woman’s shelter. I will be out of here and survive no matter what. I will be blocking her number and picking myself back up. Despite being 21, I’m at a low in life. I’ve been sheltered from friends and community. I have no one. But I will make it. I live in England, I’m grateful that I have the opportunity to escape. I have all my documents and passport packed. She also has no access to my bank account and I have a few hundred bucks to get me by right now until I get a job.

She isn’t usually violent, only with me. I’ve decided I don’t want to go to the police now. My priority is moving out and being anywhere but here. I know my extended family will call me, I will NOT pick up. My little sister will know I’m safe but that’s it. I’m here right now typing this because I have no one to help me. I’m gathering strength with each letter I type. I *will* make a life for myself, one of my doing, one that overcomes the trauma she has inflicted on me my whole life. I *will* succeed despite it all.

I’m hoping that things go well and I’m able to come back here and let you know that I’ve taken the step, that I’m doing it. I will find a job, I will work hard, I will decide how my future looks. I’m done being the chained elephant who doesn’t know her own strength. I will be **FREE**. I only wish I didn’t have to be all alone doing this.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter:  Don't fall into the trap of a seemingly nice partner comes along and wants to give you the world, only to continue the cycle of abuse.

>**OOP:** (Un?)fortunately, I don’t trust at all when it comes to romantic situations. I’ve refused many dates with seemingly nice men before, because I’m not mentally healed from this household. After I attend therapy and work more towards healing maybe I’ll give it a proper go, but definitely not now.  
I also don’t have a car :/ wish I had, I’d be out of here by now if I did. It’s one of my goals though for when I’m more financially stable, learning how to drive and getting myself a car

*Work:*

>I have BCC from my A-levels, and a Level 3 certificate in cyber security practices. I haven’t gone to uni, I explain a little about that in another post. But I have a good enough CV (resume), so I’ve been mass applying to jobs online despite the lack of vacancies. I’m planning on calling job agencies too, every morning, and maybe start off with a zero-contract job whilst I look for something more stable  
\[Edit\] I live in England to clarify, but in summary the credentials mentioned above means that I am employable enough (I think?). I haven’t had a job before which sucks but I am really good at adapting and learning.

**Title:** I’m about to do it. There’s only 9 hours left till I leave and never look back. My life begins tomorrow. I’m so scared

Posted about my [plans to leave this abusive house](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/s/w81STK43S2) yesterday. I live in England.

I am quite literally shitting bricks. I know I’m a 21 year old woman, but I’ve been completely conditioned to believe that I cannot achieve anything on my own. My so called mother ingrained in me that I’d never succeed without her ‘guidance’. This is the *FIRST* time I’m taking such a drastic step that no one ever expected me to do. I won’t mull over how I’ve let them think so low of me with my inaction. I can’t victim-blame myself. I feel so panicky omg. Monday morning, I’m out. Bag is packed, essential’s ready. Important documents and passport all secured. I don’t know where I’ll end up tomorrow night. I have no idea what the future entails. I have no means to support myself currently but my priority is escaping this hell. I’m posting here to hold myself accountable and ensure that my resolve doesn’t waver so that I ACTUALLY leave and don’t doubt myself. I have to believe that anything is better than subjecting myself to more of this abuse. I feel like a clueless child, inexperienced and uninformed about the world. I have no one, no friends. But I’m doing this anyway.

Please please please give me some moral support. I really need it. You guys don’t understand how much your advice helps. Letting me know that I **can** do this is giving the confidence I’ve always needed to take the step. I’m hoping to update you in a few days about how it’s going. I hope I survive and thrive. I hope she doesn’t end up being right.

Thank you so much. I’m still looking for jobs so I can get a steady income and start saving. My life begins tomorrow.

**\[EDIT- 11:30a.m GMT\]** Left at 9am carrying only a backpack and a dream. I’ve been seen by the youth hub charity that I mentioned in the comments!! The lady who spoke to me 2 months ago opened the files of the risk assessment I took back then, and I had another round of updated assessments to see that I’m not at risk of hurting myself. I told them about what happened. They said that they’ve sent away my information to the housing association in my city, and will hopefully find an all-female accommodation by tonight. I did reiterate that a mixed accommodation is fine for now because I need somewhere to sleep tonight as I’m definitely not going back that house. Guys it’s actually happening this feels so surreal. I’ll do a proper update once I’m situated and more settled.

**\[EDIT 2- 14:30 GMT\]** I’ve got a horrible headache, I’ll make a full update about everything later on but right now I just want to ask what other options I have in West Midlands? Our councils are strapped for cash, our charities are closing due to lack of funding. The level of loops I’m being forced through is diabolical. I understand I guess, people can lie just for housing. The questioning of the abuse made me even less secure in myself- felt like I’m making it bigger than it is, but I’m still pushing through. Like I said I’ll make a detailed update but in short: as of right now I’ve called the police, waiting for them to email/text me with the crime number so I can forward that to the charity workers who’ll send it to the council. Then, I’ll wait for a call back from the housing association AGAIN. I just really hope I get answers before night time, so that I have time to think of other options. I’ve been sitting down, stressed and mentally drained from having to explain what I went through over and over again. Anyway, I hope I’m back later with better news.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1ibp0w0/update_i_did_it_its_been_15_hours_since_i_left_i/) **2: January 27, 2025 (Next day, 2 days from OG post)**

Hey! I’m the 21 year old young woman from England (West Midlands to be specific) that was planning to escape and live her new life. Fair warning - this post ended up being so much longer than I intended it to be 😀

If you’re new, I posted last night about [leaving my toxic household](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/s/y0KERxYY8p). I talked about not having anyone, being all alone, but being determined despite that.

So I got up at 7am all nervous. Had breakfast. Ensured the kids (edit: I’m referring to my 3 younger siblings living there, all over 15yrs old) and mother were gone before I got ready to leave. Just as I was about to go downstairs to leave, I heard my mum come back which never happens once she leaves for work. She heard me moving about but didn’t bother me, just went to the bathroom and left. Longest 10 minutes of my life, I really wanted out and right on the day I secretly made a solid decision she was back to haunt me lol. Anyway, I didn’t overthink it - I left just after she did and walked in the opposite direction to the bus stop.

I got to the youth hub at 9am. Told them of my emergency and that I needed somewhere to sleep tonight as I had nowhere to go. Things seemed to be going well (in [the other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/s/y0KERxYY8p) I added edits as things were happening in real time so feel free to read that) but I hit a snag when the housing association called me and said that they can’t help with just my words - I could be lying thus needed evidence. They asked if I had filed a report with the police yet or if I had medical records from the days of the attack. I said no and no. The lady speaking to me seemed like she just wanted to end the call there but with enough prodding she did tell me that if I filed a report and gave them a crime number I could then be housed somewhere tonight.

I called the police, which was a whole other gruelling experience. The first woman who picked up was so sweet, she was patient and told me to take my time once I mentioned I was reporting abuse. However, they referred the call to another man (from the domestic violence department with the cops) and that call was so emotionally draining. It was a video call, and his whole demeanour read like he was annoyed at me and that this wasn’t a big deal. I reiterated to him this is the first time reporting my family so I’d need a little patience. He kept telling me to stop adding unnecessary details and cut to the point with the events. Verbatim. I was so stressed recalling what occurred and his bluntness wasn’t helping🥲 At one point he let out a chuckle when I said I didn’t want to press charges, I just needed the report on file so that I won’t be reported missing. So that I can be housed away from that unsafe place. Then his demeanour turned into “oh so \*that’\*s why she’s doing this” & he proceeded to talk to me like I’m a moron and say “you can give them the crime number, but the council won’t get any details if they ask so don’t think any data protection laws will be breached to solve your housing problem”. I was thinking DUHHHH I KNOW THAT. Anyway I’m just ranting about him because he actually gave me a migraine.

The crime number did end up being enough, and once sent back to the council I got a call after another 2 hours telling me that I’ve been referred to an all-female shared accommodation with housing support. That accommodation ended up calling me just 30 minutes later, telling me to come over now. I assumed they just wanted to talk to me, so I said I have a big bag and I’m tired is it possible to talk over the phone. The lady said “oh no I’m telling you to come because there’s a room that was *just* vacated this morning, come see if you wanna stay”. There was of course no question about it - I went on my way, taking another 30 minute bus ride.

Anyway, got there looking dishevelled and crazed. I was so exhausted. I got a brief tour (can’t recall anything), she talked to me and I filled out some forms and signed some papers. So I’m officially here for the foreseeable future, only paying a small weekly service fee until I get a well-paying job after which they won’t help me and I’ll pay the full rent!

I’m so tired. I haven’t eaten since this morning, I’ve been having some snacks but that’s all. I plan on getting cleaning supplies, cleaning the room up tomorrow (they didn’t get a chance to clean it before I came), and being grateful despite the fact that some things that aren’t great here. I’ll go into more detail on that in another post because this is getting too long. Sorry for rambling I hope you’re still reading.

I talked to my little sister and she said my mother has no idea still. Like I said before, drama with my mother means she’ll ignore me for weeks after. So the fact that this one is newly fresh (literally occurred only 2 days ago) means she hasn’t seeked me out at all. I have blocked her + brother’s numbers. They will not be able to contact me and they don’t know where I am. I also specified to the police that I’m not missing, I’m safe and any missing reports are false. I told them to call me if they get such a report and need to confirm my safety.

Okay finally let’s talk about how I feel: I CANNOT believe myself. I have a bed to sleep in, a wardrobe to put clothes in, somewhere to be that and it only happened because I took that step. I’m out of that toxic house and they don’t even know it. I didn’t know I was this strong. Now that I’ve taken this step, I know I won’t go back. That niggling doubt is fading. I’m so proud of me :)

I’ve got a lot more to say about the room and the accommodation overall but for now I want to bask in this achievement. It was a long 10 hours of constant worrying that I’d have to sleep in an unsafe environment tonight. Yet I didn’t run back to that house when the fear hit. I stuck it out. I said I’d sleep outside if I had to, or not sleep at all. Despite the obstacles thrown at me, being told that I’m *not really* homeless if I didn’t get kicked out, being made to feel that I was lying about fleeing abuse - I still stuck it out. And now I’m here in a warm bed.

Yes, once I settled and was left alone with my thoughts, I felt so horrified at myself for reporting my “family”. But I got over it quickly because I thought back to what they did. Family don’t do that. I didn’t betray them, they betrayed me. I’m realistic so I am expecting to feel more negative emotions as I find my independence. But that’s okay, I know that’s just the teething pains from growing. This turned into a whole saga I apologise, I have lots more to say but for now thank you so much for your encouragements, advice and help. Thank you for cheering me on. You helped me see this through.

I’ll update you guys as there’s so much more to say, with details about a potential friend I made with my roommate?/neighbour? (got each other’s numbers yay!) and all the gossip and lore I got from her about this place. She gave me so much tea and hacks to survive with your things intact lool, I’ll be speaking to her more she seems so nice :))

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1iduv08/3_days_since_i_left_my_abusive_home_and_she_still/) **3: January 30, 2025 (3 days from last post, 5 from OG)**

**Title:** 3 days since I left my abusive home, and she STILL has no idea… can’t make this shit up

\[...\]

So, today is Day 3. I’m more settled now, I’ve been feeling comfortable in my independence. I’ve gone out and bought essential groceries for myself. I’ve been eating and I’m glad to say I’m alive and well. As the days go on, I feel so much confidence in the decision I took. I know there’ll be a low point in the future (maybe once my period starts again next month and my hormones are out of wack) where my loneliness will overwhelm me, but I’m prepared. I know it’s natural, it’s inevitable and it’ll pass :)

I’ve also got therapy scheduled for Wednesday 5th February! I’m glad it’s happening- I’ve simultaneously left the abusive environment and starting my healing journey. Yay

In regards to drama at the house I left, my little sister called me to tell me that my mother doesn’t even know I’m gone yet. I mentioned in my previous posts that when my mum would fight with me and say the most horrible stuff (or in this case, hit me), she would ignore me for weeks. This is still the case, she’s still “ignoring” me, so she hasn’t checked my room. She hasn’t seen me either (obviously lol I’m long *goneeee*), so she has assumed that I’ve barricaded myself inside my room and that I only come out when she’s at work😂😂

With that context in mind, my sister told me the funniest things that have happened since I left. 2 days ago in the car when my mum was dropping my siblings off to school, she started shouting at my sister. Nothing new there, but my sister almost burst out laughing when my mother began ranting crazily about “that sister of yours that hasn’t even left her room in days and has stunk up the place, is that who you wanna be like?!!”

Then, yesterday morning, apparently she was angry at another sibling and went upstairs to shout at them for not being ready to go to school. She was passing my room and decided to knock aggressively whilst shouting through the door. She was yelling about how this is *her* house, I have no right to (her words) “shout and abuse your own mother then lock yourself in your room and avoid all responsibility!! you WILL come out! If I am back and you’re not out then watch what happens !!”

Mind you, she’s saying all this with the door closed. It’s 7am, I’m not there, I’m 10 miles away sleeping in another bed. Who tf was she screaming at 😂😂😂😂😂😂

When my sister was telling me this I was genuinely dying of laughter. I couldn’t believe the level of ridiculousness. Like what do you mean you’re screaming at someone through the door, not knowing if they’re there or not, yet wasting your breath anyway. She didn’t even take a peek to ensure I had heard her🤣🤣🤣

As funny as it was, it also made me realise the craziness I lived in my whole life. My mother felt so comfortable in abusing me because she genuinely believed there was no limit for me. All my other siblings, she holds back because she doesn’t know how far she can go before they’re irreversibly pushed away. With me, she exploited my sensitivity and clear desperation for a loving mother. She felt so comfortable saying whatever, doing whatever, thinking I’d never go anywhere despite it.

The day after her attacking me, she was quiet, telling my sister to bring me food. She knew she was wrong at least at first.

The day after that, I left in the morning as you all know. Since then, I haven’t been back as I have everything I need for now. So she hasn’t seen me. Yet she assumes I’m still there.

And because she assumes I’m still there, she is relieved that the *small* doubt she had about me *actually* leaving (which came from me telling her I would after taking my suitcase upstairs on the day of the attack) was gone. And so because her belief that I’ll never leave is reinforced again, she now feels comfortable twisting everything to make it seem like I was the one who attacked *her*, even shouting at me for it… through a closed door that I am *not* behind, lol

It’s hilarious, this is what I’d have to endure if I stayed. I have **never ever** felt more secure in my decision than now. I was right - anything else would have been better for me than subjecting myself to more of her bullshit.

Anyway, that’s enough on the update front. I’m sure I’ll have another story to tell when she finds out that I *actually* did leave. I wish I could be a fly on the wall to see that reaction. I’ve already blocked her because I **do not** want her contacting me at all, and that’s bringing me much needed peace right now :)

***\[edit\]***

It’s been 4hrs since I posted here, after reading some comments and thinking to myself I’ve decided to unblock her just to ensure any messages that come through can be used as evidence if needed. Muting it though, just to preserve my peace like I mentioned

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1ikxvz7/12th_day_update_on_leaving_abusive_house_family/) **4: February 8, 2025 (9 days later, 14 from OG post)**

Hello. It’s been a while, haven’t been feeling well enough to update - first emotionally, now physically unwell. If you want some background information before continuing, look at my latest post which has all the details linked.

Things are a little disorderly in my head but I’ll try to go chronologically

So that day my mother was screaming through the closed door, I mentioned she said she’d be checking back to see if I was still in the room. Of course, I hadn’t even been in the house for 3 days before that but she hadn’t realised. Anyway, that afternoon she must’ve checked the room and realised I wasn’t there. She assumed I had crashed at a friend’s house (which is hilarious considering she knows I have no friends, but I guess it’s how she justified it in her brain because she couldn’t imagine me truly leaving with no where else to go).

She asked my siblings and of course as discussed with them they both feigned ignorance. They said they don’t know anything.

A day after that (8 days ago), my aunt called me twice in the afternoon. I learnt from my 15F sister that upon calling me, my aunt called my mother to ask why I wasn’t picking. My mother told her “she’s not home, I don’t know where the hell she is but I’m guessing she’s with friends.” Well, this aunt of mine is one emotional busybody (bless her but also give me a break pls) so she - in her worried state - called her brother (my uncle). I was at the cinema when my uncle began spam calling me. Then, my aunt began spam calling me. Now imagine, I’m watching the new film ‘Companion’ (it was meh, expected more) and I get spam called by relatives. My anxiety levels were through the roof. I put my phone on DnD and let them know I’d talk to them later.

At the same time, my 20F younger sister (who I’ve mentioned escaped before me and goes to university in a different city) texted me to let me know that our mother was spam calling her. She told me how their conversation went - my sister feigned ignorance too, saying she hadn’t heard from me. My mother went on a rant, venting about me and my “audacity to leave without saying anything”. Mother told my sister “tell her that she is *not* allowed back! Tell her she can stay wherever she is!!” Sis said she could barely hold in her laughter. Mind you, this whole time I’ve unblocked my mother so if she was really curious she could’ve called. However, she made no attempts to contact me (which I’m glad for). But it’s *really* annoying how she’s sending people after me with her “woe is me my rebellious daughter is nowhere to be seen” bs.

On that note, I should mention that said uncle called me back after I left the cinema that day. He was poking and prodding to figure out where I was. I stood firm in being vague, told him I’m safe and that’s all that he needs to know. I emphasised that I’m emotionally drained and have nothing else to say. I mentioned to him that I’m gone for good though. I forwarded that message to my aunt too.

That whole interaction drained my energy, so I was unable to update on how things went. Yet even then, my mother still hadn’t gotten it in her head that I was gone for real. I guess she realised couple of days ago when she saw me leaving the old house with my suitcase and duffel bag. Since she didn’t contact me directly, I felt safe enough to go to the house when she wasn’t there and get my stuff. She was on her way back when she saw me getting into the Uber. There was no big reveal lol. Better this way, I left quietly without fuss. I acted completely different to what was expected of me. No drama, no justification, no last words. I actually like that it went like that. I think it was very unsatisfactory for my mother, so another win there lol. At least her pride will not let her contact me - that would’ve hurt me before, but it works in my favour now.

I also had my first therapy session on Wednesday 5th Feb. Went well, still feel weird about opening up. I feel so self-aware about who I am so it’ll be interesting to see if I learn more about myself. Unfortunately, with this being a free service, I only have up to 8 sessions (8 weeks). Then I’m left to my own devices. I was referred by my GP to a NHS wellbeing practice sooo I don’t know where I’d go from there. I don’t have the money to pay for therapy.

After my therapy on Wednesday I broke my damn molar lol. I was eating and it went *craaackkk*. I had an ugly meltdown it was the last thing I needed. Luckily, I was able to get an emergency appointment for the next morning to get it removed because it posed a danger apparently. I didn’t wanna wait for severe nerve pain, so I opted for the extraction. That shit was sooo painful. I only received a local anaesthetic, but I swear I felt the pain. I (of course) tried to be calm but the sight of the blood being sucked away in those tube things made me feel faint haha (I could never work in the medical field).

Anyway, it’s been 2 days since I’ve had it removed. I’m still swollen, still in pain. Haven’t eaten much, have an extreme fear of getting dry socket. Reading online about it hasn’t eased my anxiety lol. I don’t have much energy to make myself soft foods either, but I’ll try make myself some oats tomorrow morning. Speaking of dry socket, I’m not in throbbing pain right now. I’m fine. It’s been around 55 hours since the extraction. How much longer am I at risk for? I haven’t even spat vigorously or brushed my teeth properly (yuck) all that time - been very gently rinsing with warm salt water though. I hope I can go back to normal soon. It’s very very very lonely, recovering from surgery all alone on the first few days of moving out.

Another good thing is that I’ve got a food bank voucher. It’s near where I live, and I was supposed to go there yesterday, but with my whole oral emergency .. alas. However, I hope to go next week when I feel better. They’ll give out essentials like rice, oats, sugar and pasta. It would really help me out.

Anyway, my apologies if this was not coherent. I tried haha. My head’s killing me I need to take ibuprofen

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1in617r/update_15_days_since_i_left_successful_food_bank/) **5: February 11, 2025 (3 days from previous update)**

**Title:** 15 days since I left. Successful food bank trip today!

Heyy! It’s the 21F from England who [fled her abusive household](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/s/i7eGNfED6v). Call me Kenzie, I love that name !

So today, I had an appointment with a support worker from the charity that initially helped me when I fled. She was nice, expressing the ways she can support me. She’ll be able to help me with budgeting, going with me to grocery shop if needed , helping me brainstorm my next steps etc. I have another appointment with her next week! :)

After that meeting, I went straight to the food bank with my voucher. Because the person who referred me (an employment coach I see alongside my therapist) specified that I am also in need of cutlery, pots and pans and all that, the food bank had SOOOOO much second-hand stuff ready for me. I was *so* geeked !! There was a kettle, plates, measuring cup, pans and pots, spoons and forks, mugs, teabags, sanitary items, even shampoo and conditioner! They went over and above and my heart is so full I’m so happy. Of course, there was the food too - lots of beans and tuna and mackerel as well as chickpeas, rice pudding, custard etc. Basically all the canned food you can think of ! I haven’t looked through the bags thoroughly, but I’m also hoping there’s rice and pasta too. It’s okay if there’s not, I can buy that myself :)

(Also, my sister who lives in a different city is sending over a package of old pans and pots she doesn’t use either, so I’ll have more than enough to make all sorts of meals! I like lasagna, so I’ll probably buy a glass tray for that too idk if that’s what it’s called lol)

Carrying all that back on a bus ride + walk by myself was extremely difficult, but some nice strangers helped me carry some stuff. Then when I was near the accommodation, I called my housemate (the girl who was lovely to me the first day I came here) and she helped without question, even bringing a little shopping trolly she owns to carry the stuff. She’s actually an angel, I felt comfortable asking for her help. I’ve reiterated to her that if she ever needs anything I’m here for her too.

Anyway, all that stuff is stacked in my room now. I’m incredibly tired because as soon as I dropped the food bank stuff off, I went straight back out to do some grocery shopping (getting oil, milk etc) and those were heavy too. Came back and collapsed onto bed hahah. I have some more stuff to buy, like seasoning and whatever. But for now, I have enough to finallyyy make a good meal ! I’m so grateful and soo glad.

I’ll give myself a break tonight, but tomorrow morning I’ll wash up all the cutlery I got from the food bank. I’ll clean the cupboards I have (I’ve got locks for them too so no one can steal my stuff yay!!) and put everything away. That way, my room can be free from any clutter. I also bought washing up detergent and liquid soooo I’ll do my laundry too!!

I will also sign myself up at the nearby dentist and GP so I don’t neglect my health! Hoping to do that tomorrow :)

Still haven’t heard back from the volunteering gig, but I’ll update with any news of that when I do!

Hope to be back soon :)))

**Small update**

woke up this morning and washed all the cutlery I received! Put everything away in the cupboard, andddd yesss there were rice and pasta there too! I have enough food to last me over a week truly, so many combinations. There’s even a veggie curry in a can that I can heat up and eat with the rice! I’m so happy :)

also there’s this one small glass oval thing that I have no clue what it is, is there a subreddit to find out the names of odd items? Google didn’t help lol I’m a bit confused -> **edit** I’m told it’s a lid for a casserole dish? Never would’ve thought

**Title:** AITAH for refusing to speak to my brother after he attacked me

Repost because it was removed from the AITA sub for mentioning violence. Oops

I feel inclined to share this since I’m getting berated by my extended family.

For context, I’m 21F and he’s 15M. My little brother (Rascal) is a narcissistic menace. As a kid, it was tolerable - I was his older sister, and being the eldest daughter of 5 kids in an ethnic household meant every action of his (and the rest of them) was on me. But as he grew older, he began taking advantage of the fact that I’m the scapegoat of the house, the one no one respects or listens to but is blamed for everything.

The straw that broke the camel’s back was him attacking me 2 weeks ago. He had my wrists on a death grip and I instinctively fought to get him off me. I was dumbfounded and also scared because he attacked me at the top of the stairs, and I was on the verge of falling down. He had a growth spurt last year so is 5’10” to my 5’5”, which perhaps gave him the confidence to manhandle his older sister??

I would’ve left there and then, but it was 10pm at night, with no car & nowhere to go. I woke up the next day with bruises on my wrists and got really upset and angry all over again. I called my uncle to tell him what happened because I didn’t know what else to do. I regret that because whilst he did tear Rascal a new one, he also told him to apologise to me after “she’s had a day to calm down”. Rascal didn’t do that, and I was truly hoping he’d never talk to me again since he didn’t get any punishment anyway, no one held him accountable for his behaviour - he just went straight back to his PS5.

However, my uncle called me back a few days ago and asked if Rascal had apologised yet. I was in my room, assuming no one was around, so I was talking loudly when I said “No, he didn’t apologise, and I don’t want a measly apology that means nothing anyway. He has done this over and over again and I’m tired of the abuse. I’ve done nothing to deserve this.”

Rascal was standing outside my room and heard that uncle was on call with me, and in an attempt to manipulate the situation again he ran, got some leftover snacks from his room and knocked on my door *whilst I was still on call with uncle*

My uncle heard Rascal come into my room & throw the snacks at me whilst saying sorry loudly. I saw red & threw the measly bag back at him, telling him to never speak to me again. My uncle started saying “wait, he apologised?? Why are you screaming, go tell him you accept it.”

I said lol you must be mad and ended the call.

Haven’t talked to uncle since either, I regret even involving him but I had no one to speak to, no friends, and my therapist appointment is in a month.

My cousin called me today: said Uncle told her everything and that I’m a bad sister for not hearing my brother out, that I should talk to him. She said “siblings fight all the time!”

So, AITA for standing my ground and vowing not to speak to him again?

*(I will be moving out and going NC with my mother for other reasons, but this situation has solidified the fact that I also want nothing to do with him and his abuse.)*

**Background** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i2xd1j/aita_for_telling_my_father_he_cannot_tell_me_what/) **2: January 16, 2025**

**Title:** AITA for telling my father he cannot tell me what to do

I’m 21F, and trying to move out. I live in England. It’s been a long process due to some financial issues, but I’m getting there - I have an end goal in mind which is good.

My father does not live with us. He works abroad. Him and my mother are not on good terms but for some reason won’t divorce, just separated. He also has another family which may add context.

I made the mistake of talking about me moving out within earshot of my mother a while ago. Ever since then, she’s been trying to manipulate me, not realising that the curtains have been lifted from my eyes. I see every word for what it is - a power play, an attempt to chain me to a toxic environment that uses me as a scapegoat.

When her final card, telling me to stay because I’m useless and can’t be independent and would be better off saving my money for a car instead of rent and bills, didn’t work on me - she called my dad to talk some ‘sense’ into me.

The call from him was triggering, but I pushed through and said I don’t want to live here. I hate that I’m either being taken advantage of or demeaned. He kept pushing, so in anger I said I hate *her*. That he cannot convince me to stay just to slave away for people who don’t care about me. I said I rather be in debt and pay my rent in money, instead of paying it with my mental health as I’ve done my entire life.

He said “are you refusing to listen to your father?” I said “Maybe you’d have a leg to stand on if you were here, but you’re working abroad, have another family that you don’t even live with either and are probably thinking about. You’ve got enough on your plate so please don’t bother with me now, my decision is set.”

He was furious and called my siblings in anger ranting about me. They’ve not said anything really. My mother then got wind of what I said and has been badgering me ever since to apologise to him. I admit I have been avoiding his calls because I was angry when I said everything. I’m feeling slightly guilty now for causing a rift.

AITA for shutting down my father, arguing with him and telling him he cannot tell me what to do?

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1i9ytmt/i_am_leaving_this_house_i_will_have_no_one_to/)**: January 25, 2025 (9 days after background posts)**

This one is long, please read if you can. I’d love to get some advice and moral support.

In previous posts, I mentioned how chaotic my home life is, [how my brother attacked me](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/IaKlv8ayRi) and how my anger was dismissed. This links to today’s events.

I’m 21F, with a mother that hates her life and therefore projects all her negative emotions onto her children - mainly me. She has the classic victim-mentality narcissistic mindset, spewing the same bullshit about how I am the cause of all her troubles, I am the reason for her behaviour. Refuses to have a civil conversation without screaming at me, has NEVER apologised for anything, has never ever hugged me or told me she loved me. That’s not an exaggeration - NEVER.

Being the eldest daughter, I was blamed for it all. Her behaviour is always my fault according to her. I’m too emotionally drained to give specific context but just know that the “why does my mother hate me?” questions began when I was just a 5 year old little girl.

In the past few years, I had accepted that no amount of begging, pleading or bargaining would give me the loving mother I yearn for. So I decided to protect my emotions from being exploited. I stopped trying to reason with her.

After the incident with my brother, I continued not speaking to anyone. Going about my life outside, coming back here just to sleep. Without the financial independence to move out and no friends to stay with, I thought I had to endure this until I got my money up.

But I’m at the end of my rope. Today, after not speaking to each other for weeks, she came and commanded me to do fill out a long form for her. I said “I’m not ready to act like nothing happened. I was assaulted and nearly thrown off a flight of stairs by your son and you did nothing but watched. And then dismissed me when I broke down in rage. You have ignored me since. If you’re gonna talk to me, then let’s start with what happened that night.”

She began ranting about how everything was my fault. How I’m selfish for expecting her to sort him out when he won’t listen to her. I said “you laughed at me in front of him and told me to stop the dramatics. **In front of him**.” The ranting from her dragged on and I just left to go to my room. She came up after me cussing me out. This is where I lost it and began recording so I have evidence. She yanked my phone and threw it back at me. Then proceeded to continue raging at me.

I made a mistake and said “that’s what you are” as a reply to one of her horrible insults to me. She began hitting me, I tried moving away but she continued - at one point punching my face. Now she is shorter than me, and I’m quite obviously stronger. I could’ve fought back. But regardless of everything, in my heart she’s my mother and I didn’t want to touch her and give her ammunition to use against me. I managed to grab my suitcase and duffel bag which became a shield against her attacks. I went upstairs, hyperventilating and needing to get OUT.

As mentioned in my previous posts, she has tried manipulating me to stay and not leave the house before. But something about today opened my mind - I rather be living in shelters than be here. I packed a bag but all the numbers I called wouldn’t pick up. I’ve been in my room for the past 5 hours, trying to hatch out a plan. I can’t leave if there’s a risk I’ll be forced back because of circumstances. I know because of previous fights in this house that my mother will give me the silent treatment for weeks, so I have time to hash out a plan.

I have no friends. No one to stay with. So on Monday morning, I will take my bag and go to a woman’s shelter. I will be out of here and survive no matter what. I will be blocking her number and picking myself back up. Despite being 21, I’m at a low in life. I’ve been sheltered from friends and community. I have no one. But I will make it. I live in England, I’m grateful that I have the opportunity to escape. I have all my documents and passport packed. She also has no access to my bank account and I have a few hundred bucks to get me by right now until I get a job.

She isn’t usually violent, only with me. I’ve decided I don’t want to go to the police now. My priority is moving out and being anywhere but here. I know my extended family will call me, I will NOT pick up. My little sister will know I’m safe but that’s it. I’m here right now typing this because I have no one to help me. I’m gathering strength with each letter I type. I *will* make a life for myself, one of my doing, one that overcomes the trauma she has inflicted on me my whole life. I *will* succeed despite it all.

I’m hoping that things go well and I’m able to come back here and let you know that I’ve taken the step, that I’m doing it. I will find a job, I will work hard, I will decide how my future looks. I’m done being the chained elephant who doesn’t know her own strength. I will be **FREE**. I only wish I didn’t have to be all alone doing this.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter:  Don't fall into the trap of a seemingly nice partner comes along and wants to give you the world, only to continue the cycle of abuse.

>**OOP:** (Un?)fortunately, I don’t trust at all when it comes to romantic situations. I’ve refused many dates with seemingly nice men before, because I’m not mentally healed from this household. After I attend therapy and work more towards healing maybe I’ll give it a proper go, but definitely not now.  
I also don’t have a car :/ wish I had, I’d be out of here by now if I did. It’s one of my goals though for when I’m more financially stable, learning how to drive and getting myself a car

*Work:*

>I have BCC from my A-levels, and a Level 3 certificate in cyber security practices. I haven’t gone to uni, I explain a little about that in another post. But I have a good enough CV (resume), so I’ve been mass applying to jobs online despite the lack of vacancies. I’m planning on calling job agencies too, every morning, and maybe start off with a zero-contract job whilst I look for something more stable  
\[Edit\] I live in England to clarify, but in summary the credentials mentioned above means that I am employable enough (I think?). I haven’t had a job before which sucks but I am really good at adapting and learning.

**Title:** I’m about to do it. There’s only 9 hours left till I leave and never look back. My life begins tomorrow. I’m so scared

Posted about my [plans to leave this abusive house](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/s/w81STK43S2) yesterday. I live in England.

I am quite literally shitting bricks. I know I’m a 21 year old woman, but I’ve been completely conditioned to believe that I cannot achieve anything on my own. My so called mother ingrained in me that I’d never succeed without her ‘guidance’. This is the *FIRST* time I’m taking such a drastic step that no one ever expected me to do. I won’t mull over how I’ve let them think so low of me with my inaction. I can’t victim-blame myself. I feel so panicky omg. Monday morning, I’m out. Bag is packed, essential’s ready. Important documents and passport all secured. I don’t know where I’ll end up tomorrow night. I have no idea what the future entails. I have no means to support myself currently but my priority is escaping this hell. I’m posting here to hold myself accountable and ensure that my resolve doesn’t waver so that I ACTUALLY leave and don’t doubt myself. I have to believe that anything is better than subjecting myself to more of this abuse. I feel like a clueless child, inexperienced and uninformed about the world. I have no one, no friends. But I’m doing this anyway.

Please please please give me some moral support. I really need it. You guys don’t understand how much your advice helps. Letting me know that I **can** do this is giving the confidence I’ve always needed to take the step. I’m hoping to update you in a few days about how it’s going. I hope I survive and thrive. I hope she doesn’t end up being right.

Thank you so much. I’m still looking for jobs so I can get a steady income and start saving. My life begins tomorrow.

**\[EDIT- 11:30a.m GMT\]** Left at 9am carrying only a backpack and a dream. I’ve been seen by the youth hub charity that I mentioned in the comments!! The lady who spoke to me 2 months ago opened the files of the risk assessment I took back then, and I had another round of updated assessments to see that I’m not at risk of hurting myself. I told them about what happened. They said that they’ve sent away my information to the housing association in my city, and will hopefully find an all-female accommodation by tonight. I did reiterate that a mixed accommodation is fine for now because I need somewhere to sleep tonight as I’m definitely not going back that house. Guys it’s actually happening this feels so surreal. I’ll do a proper update once I’m situated and more settled.

**\[EDIT 2- 14:30 GMT\]** I’ve got a horrible headache, I’ll make a full update about everything later on but right now I just want to ask what other options I have in West Midlands? Our councils are strapped for cash, our charities are closing due to lack of funding. The level of loops I’m being forced through is diabolical. I understand I guess, people can lie just for housing. The questioning of the abuse made me even less secure in myself- felt like I’m making it bigger than it is, but I’m still pushing through. Like I said I’ll make a detailed update but in short: as of right now I’ve called the police, waiting for them to email/text me with the crime number so I can forward that to the charity workers who’ll send it to the council. Then, I’ll wait for a call back from the housing association AGAIN. I just really hope I get answers before night time, so that I have time to think of other options. I’ve been sitting down, stressed and mentally drained from having to explain what I went through over and over again. Anyway, I hope I’m back later with better news.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1ibp0w0/update_i_did_it_its_been_15_hours_since_i_left_i/) **2: January 27, 2025 (Next day, 2 days from OG post)**

Hey! I’m the 21 year old young woman from England (West Midlands to be specific) that was planning to escape and live her new life. Fair warning - this post ended up being so much longer than I intended it to be 😀

If you’re new, I posted last night about [leaving my toxic household](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/s/y0KERxYY8p). I talked about not having anyone, being all alone, but being determined despite that.

So I got up at 7am all nervous. Had breakfast. Ensured the kids (edit: I’m referring to my 3 younger siblings living there, all over 15yrs old) and mother were gone before I got ready to leave. Just as I was about to go downstairs to leave, I heard my mum come back which never happens once she leaves for work. She heard me moving about but didn’t bother me, just went to the bathroom and left. Longest 10 minutes of my life, I really wanted out and right on the day I secretly made a solid decision she was back to haunt me lol. Anyway, I didn’t overthink it - I left just after she did and walked in the opposite direction to the bus stop.

I got to the youth hub at 9am. Told them of my emergency and that I needed somewhere to sleep tonight as I had nowhere to go. Things seemed to be going well (in [the other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/s/y0KERxYY8p) I added edits as things were happening in real time so feel free to read that) but I hit a snag when the housing association called me and said that they can’t help with just my words - I could be lying thus needed evidence. They asked if I had filed a report with the police yet or if I had medical records from the days of the attack. I said no and no. The lady speaking to me seemed like she just wanted to end the call there but with enough prodding she did tell me that if I filed a report and gave them a crime number I could then be housed somewhere tonight.

I called the police, which was a whole other gruelling experience. The first woman who picked up was so sweet, she was patient and told me to take my time once I mentioned I was reporting abuse. However, they referred the call to another man (from the domestic violence department with the cops) and that call was so emotionally draining. It was a video call, and his whole demeanour read like he was annoyed at me and that this wasn’t a big deal. I reiterated to him this is the first time reporting my family so I’d need a little patience. He kept telling me to stop adding unnecessary details and cut to the point with the events. Verbatim. I was so stressed recalling what occurred and his bluntness wasn’t helping🥲 At one point he let out a chuckle when I said I didn’t want to press charges, I just needed the report on file so that I won’t be reported missing. So that I can be housed away from that unsafe place. Then his demeanour turned into “oh so \*that’\*s why she’s doing this” & he proceeded to talk to me like I’m a moron and say “you can give them the crime number, but the council won’t get any details if they ask so don’t think any data protection laws will be breached to solve your housing problem”. I was thinking DUHHHH I KNOW THAT. Anyway I’m just ranting about him because he actually gave me a migraine.

The crime number did end up being enough, and once sent back to the council I got a call after another 2 hours telling me that I’ve been referred to an all-female shared accommodation with housing support. That accommodation ended up calling me just 30 minutes later, telling me to come over now. I assumed they just wanted to talk to me, so I said I have a big bag and I’m tired is it possible to talk over the phone. The lady said “oh no I’m telling you to come because there’s a room that was *just* vacated this morning, come see if you wanna stay”. There was of course no question about it - I went on my way, taking another 30 minute bus ride.

Anyway, got there looking dishevelled and crazed. I was so exhausted. I got a brief tour (can’t recall anything), she talked to me and I filled out some forms and signed some papers. So I’m officially here for the foreseeable future, only paying a small weekly service fee until I get a well-paying job after which they won’t help me and I’ll pay the full rent!

I’m so tired. I haven’t eaten since this morning, I’ve been having some snacks but that’s all. I plan on getting cleaning supplies, cleaning the room up tomorrow (they didn’t get a chance to clean it before I came), and being grateful despite the fact that some things that aren’t great here. I’ll go into more detail on that in another post because this is getting too long. Sorry for rambling I hope you’re still reading.

I talked to my little sister and she said my mother has no idea still. Like I said before, drama with my mother means she’ll ignore me for weeks after. So the fact that this one is newly fresh (literally occurred only 2 days ago) means she hasn’t seeked me out at all. I have blocked her + brother’s numbers. They will not be able to contact me and they don’t know where I am. I also specified to the police that I’m not missing, I’m safe and any missing reports are false. I told them to call me if they get such a report and need to confirm my safety.

Okay finally let’s talk about how I feel: I CANNOT believe myself. I have a bed to sleep in, a wardrobe to put clothes in, somewhere to be that and it only happened because I took that step. I’m out of that toxic house and they don’t even know it. I didn’t know I was this strong. Now that I’ve taken this step, I know I won’t go back. That niggling doubt is fading. I’m so proud of me :)

I’ve got a lot more to say about the room and the accommodation overall but for now I want to bask in this achievement. It was a long 10 hours of constant worrying that I’d have to sleep in an unsafe environment tonight. Yet I didn’t run back to that house when the fear hit. I stuck it out. I said I’d sleep outside if I had to, or not sleep at all. Despite the obstacles thrown at me, being told that I’m *not really* homeless if I didn’t get kicked out, being made to feel that I was lying about fleeing abuse - I still stuck it out. And now I’m here in a warm bed.

Yes, once I settled and was left alone with my thoughts, I felt so horrified at myself for reporting my “family”. But I got over it quickly because I thought back to what they did. Family don’t do that. I didn’t betray them, they betrayed me. I’m realistic so I am expecting to feel more negative emotions as I find my independence. But that’s okay, I know that’s just the teething pains from growing. This turned into a whole saga I apologise, I have lots more to say but for now thank you so much for your encouragements, advice and help. Thank you for cheering me on. You helped me see this through.

I’ll update you guys as there’s so much more to say, with details about a potential friend I made with my roommate?/neighbour? (got each other’s numbers yay!) and all the gossip and lore I got from her about this place. She gave me so much tea and hacks to survive with your things intact lool, I’ll be speaking to her more she seems so nice :))

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1iduv08/3_days_since_i_left_my_abusive_home_and_she_still/) **3: January 30, 2025 (3 days from last post, 5 from OG)**

**Title:** 3 days since I left my abusive home, and she STILL has no idea… can’t make this shit up

\[...\]

So, today is Day 3. I’m more settled now, I’ve been feeling comfortable in my independence. I’ve gone out and bought essential groceries for myself. I’ve been eating and I’m glad to say I’m alive and well. As the days go on, I feel so much confidence in the decision I took. I know there’ll be a low point in the future (maybe once my period starts again next month and my hormones are out of wack) where my loneliness will overwhelm me, but I’m prepared. I know it’s natural, it’s inevitable and it’ll pass :)

I’ve also got therapy scheduled for Wednesday 5th February! I’m glad it’s happening- I’ve simultaneously left the abusive environment and starting my healing journey. Yay

In regards to drama at the house I left, my little sister called me to tell me that my mother doesn’t even know I’m gone yet. I mentioned in my previous posts that when my mum would fight with me and say the most horrible stuff (or in this case, hit me), she would ignore me for weeks. This is still the case, she’s still “ignoring” me, so she hasn’t checked my room. She hasn’t seen me either (obviously lol I’m long *goneeee*), so she has assumed that I’ve barricaded myself inside my room and that I only come out when she’s at work😂😂

With that context in mind, my sister told me the funniest things that have happened since I left. 2 days ago in the car when my mum was dropping my siblings off to school, she started shouting at my sister. Nothing new there, but my sister almost burst out laughing when my mother began ranting crazily about “that sister of yours that hasn’t even left her room in days and has stunk up the place, is that who you wanna be like?!!”

Then, yesterday morning, apparently she was angry at another sibling and went upstairs to shout at them for not being ready to go to school. She was passing my room and decided to knock aggressively whilst shouting through the door. She was yelling about how this is *her* house, I have no right to (her words) “shout and abuse your own mother then lock yourself in your room and avoid all responsibility!! you WILL come out! If I am back and you’re not out then watch what happens !!”

Mind you, she’s saying all this with the door closed. It’s 7am, I’m not there, I’m 10 miles away sleeping in another bed. Who tf was she screaming at 😂😂😂😂😂😂

When my sister was telling me this I was genuinely dying of laughter. I couldn’t believe the level of ridiculousness. Like what do you mean you’re screaming at someone through the door, not knowing if they’re there or not, yet wasting your breath anyway. She didn’t even take a peek to ensure I had heard her🤣🤣🤣

As funny as it was, it also made me realise the craziness I lived in my whole life. My mother felt so comfortable in abusing me because she genuinely believed there was no limit for me. All my other siblings, she holds back because she doesn’t know how far she can go before they’re irreversibly pushed away. With me, she exploited my sensitivity and clear desperation for a loving mother. She felt so comfortable saying whatever, doing whatever, thinking I’d never go anywhere despite it.

The day after her attacking me, she was quiet, telling my sister to bring me food. She knew she was wrong at least at first.

The day after that, I left in the morning as you all know. Since then, I haven’t been back as I have everything I need for now. So she hasn’t seen me. Yet she assumes I’m still there.

And because she assumes I’m still there, she is relieved that the *small* doubt she had about me *actually* leaving (which came from me telling her I would after taking my suitcase upstairs on the day of the attack) was gone. And so because her belief that I’ll never leave is reinforced again, she now feels comfortable twisting everything to make it seem like I was the one who attacked *her*, even shouting at me for it… through a closed door that I am *not* behind, lol

It’s hilarious, this is what I’d have to endure if I stayed. I have **never ever** felt more secure in my decision than now. I was right - anything else would have been better for me than subjecting myself to more of her bullshit.

Anyway, that’s enough on the update front. I’m sure I’ll have another story to tell when she finds out that I *actually* did leave. I wish I could be a fly on the wall to see that reaction. I’ve already blocked her because I **do not** want her contacting me at all, and that’s bringing me much needed peace right now :)

***\[edit\]***

It’s been 4hrs since I posted here, after reading some comments and thinking to myself I’ve decided to unblock her just to ensure any messages that come through can be used as evidence if needed. Muting it though, just to preserve my peace like I mentioned

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1ikxvz7/12th_day_update_on_leaving_abusive_house_family/) **4: February 8, 2025 (9 days later, 14 from OG post)**

Hello. It’s been a while, haven’t been feeling well enough to update - first emotionally, now physically unwell. If you want some background information before continuing, look at my latest post which has all the details linked.

Things are a little disorderly in my head but I’ll try to go chronologically

So that day my mother was screaming through the closed door, I mentioned she said she’d be checking back to see if I was still in the room. Of course, I hadn’t even been in the house for 3 days before that but she hadn’t realised. Anyway, that afternoon she must’ve checked the room and realised I wasn’t there. She assumed I had crashed at a friend’s house (which is hilarious considering she knows I have no friends, but I guess it’s how she justified it in her brain because she couldn’t imagine me truly leaving with no where else to go).

She asked my siblings and of course as discussed with them they both feigned ignorance. They said they don’t know anything.

A day after that (8 days ago), my aunt called me twice in the afternoon. I learnt from my 15F sister that upon calling me, my aunt called my mother to ask why I wasn’t picking. My mother told her “she’s not home, I don’t know where the hell she is but I’m guessing she’s with friends.” Well, this aunt of mine is one emotional busybody (bless her but also give me a break pls) so she - in her worried state - called her brother (my uncle). I was at the cinema when my uncle began spam calling me. Then, my aunt began spam calling me. Now imagine, I’m watching the new film ‘Companion’ (it was meh, expected more) and I get spam called by relatives. My anxiety levels were through the roof. I put my phone on DnD and let them know I’d talk to them later.

At the same time, my 20F younger sister (who I’ve mentioned escaped before me and goes to university in a different city) texted me to let me know that our mother was spam calling her. She told me how their conversation went - my sister feigned ignorance too, saying she hadn’t heard from me. My mother went on a rant, venting about me and my “audacity to leave without saying anything”. Mother told my sister “tell her that she is *not* allowed back! Tell her she can stay wherever she is!!” Sis said she could barely hold in her laughter. Mind you, this whole time I’ve unblocked my mother so if she was really curious she could’ve called. However, she made no attempts to contact me (which I’m glad for). But it’s *really* annoying how she’s sending people after me with her “woe is me my rebellious daughter is nowhere to be seen” bs.

On that note, I should mention that said uncle called me back after I left the cinema that day. He was poking and prodding to figure out where I was. I stood firm in being vague, told him I’m safe and that’s all that he needs to know. I emphasised that I’m emotionally drained and have nothing else to say. I mentioned to him that I’m gone for good though. I forwarded that message to my aunt too.

That whole interaction drained my energy, so I was unable to update on how things went. Yet even then, my mother still hadn’t gotten it in her head that I was gone for real. I guess she realised couple of days ago when she saw me leaving the old house with my suitcase and duffel bag. Since she didn’t contact me directly, I felt safe enough to go to the house when she wasn’t there and get my stuff. She was on her way back when she saw me getting into the Uber. There was no big reveal lol. Better this way, I left quietly without fuss. I acted completely different to what was expected of me. No drama, no justification, no last words. I actually like that it went like that. I think it was very unsatisfactory for my mother, so another win there lol. At least her pride will not let her contact me - that would’ve hurt me before, but it works in my favour now.

I also had my first therapy session on Wednesday 5th Feb. Went well, still feel weird about opening up. I feel so self-aware about who I am so it’ll be interesting to see if I learn more about myself. Unfortunately, with this being a free service, I only have up to 8 sessions (8 weeks). Then I’m left to my own devices. I was referred by my GP to a NHS wellbeing practice sooo I don’t know where I’d go from there. I don’t have the money to pay for therapy.

After my therapy on Wednesday I broke my damn molar lol. I was eating and it went *craaackkk*. I had an ugly meltdown it was the last thing I needed. Luckily, I was able to get an emergency appointment for the next morning to get it removed because it posed a danger apparently. I didn’t wanna wait for severe nerve pain, so I opted for the extraction. That shit was sooo painful. I only received a local anaesthetic, but I swear I felt the pain. I (of course) tried to be calm but the sight of the blood being sucked away in those tube things made me feel faint haha (I could never work in the medical field).

Anyway, it’s been 2 days since I’ve had it removed. I’m still swollen, still in pain. Haven’t eaten much, have an extreme fear of getting dry socket. Reading online about it hasn’t eased my anxiety lol. I don’t have much energy to make myself soft foods either, but I’ll try make myself some oats tomorrow morning. Speaking of dry socket, I’m not in throbbing pain right now. I’m fine. It’s been around 55 hours since the extraction. How much longer am I at risk for? I haven’t even spat vigorously or brushed my teeth properly (yuck) all that time - been very gently rinsing with warm salt water though. I hope I can go back to normal soon. It’s very very very lonely, recovering from surgery all alone on the first few days of moving out.

Another good thing is that I’ve got a food bank voucher. It’s near where I live, and I was supposed to go there yesterday, but with my whole oral emergency .. alas. However, I hope to go next week when I feel better. They’ll give out essentials like rice, oats, sugar and pasta. It would really help me out.

Anyway, my apologies if this was not coherent. I tried haha. My head’s killing me I need to take ibuprofen

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1in617r/update_15_days_since_i_left_successful_food_bank/) **5: February 11, 2025 (3 days from previous update)**

**Title:** 15 days since I left. Successful food bank trip today!

Heyy! It’s the 21F from England who [fled her abusive household](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/s/i7eGNfED6v). Call me Kenzie, I love that name !

So today, I had an appointment with a support worker from the charity that initially helped me when I fled. She was nice, expressing the ways she can support me. She’ll be able to help me with budgeting, going with me to grocery shop if needed , helping me brainstorm my next steps etc. I have another appointment with her next week! :)

After that meeting, I went straight to the food bank with my voucher. Because the person who referred me (an employment coach I see alongside my therapist) specified that I am also in need of cutlery, pots and pans and all that, the food bank had SOOOOO much second-hand stuff ready for me. I was *so* geeked !! There was a kettle, plates, measuring cup, pans and pots, spoons and forks, mugs, teabags, sanitary items, even shampoo and conditioner! They went over and above and my heart is so full I’m so happy. Of course, there was the food too - lots of beans and tuna and mackerel as well as chickpeas, rice pudding, custard etc. Basically all the canned food you can think of ! I haven’t looked through the bags thoroughly, but I’m also hoping there’s rice and pasta too. It’s okay if there’s not, I can buy that myself :)

(Also, my sister who lives in a different city is sending over a package of old pans and pots she doesn’t use either, so I’ll have more than enough to make all sorts of meals! I like lasagna, so I’ll probably buy a glass tray for that too idk if that’s what it’s called lol)

Carrying all that back on a bus ride + walk by myself was extremely difficult, but some nice strangers helped me carry some stuff. Then when I was near the accommodation, I called my housemate (the girl who was lovely to me the first day I came here) and she helped without question, even bringing a little shopping trolly she owns to carry the stuff. She’s actually an angel, I felt comfortable asking for her help. I’ve reiterated to her that if she ever needs anything I’m here for her too.

Anyway, all that stuff is stacked in my room now. I’m incredibly tired because as soon as I dropped the food bank stuff off, I went straight back out to do some grocery shopping (getting oil, milk etc) and those were heavy too. Came back and collapsed onto bed hahah. I have some more stuff to buy, like seasoning and whatever. But for now, I have enough to finallyyy make a good meal ! I’m so grateful and soo glad.

I’ll give myself a break tonight, but tomorrow morning I’ll wash up all the cutlery I got from the food bank. I’ll clean the cupboards I have (I’ve got locks for them too so no one can steal my stuff yay!!) and put everything away. That way, my room can be free from any clutter. I also bought washing up detergent and liquid soooo I’ll do my laundry too!!

I will also sign myself up at the nearby dentist and GP so I don’t neglect my health! Hoping to do that tomorrow :)

Still haven’t heard back from the volunteering gig, but I’ll update with any news of that when I do!

Hope to be back soon :)))

**Small update**

woke up this morning and washed all the cutlery I received! Put everything away in the cupboard, andddd yesss there were rice and pasta there too! I have enough food to last me over a week truly, so many combinations. There’s even a veggie curry in a can that I can heat up and eat with the rice! I’m so happy :)

also there’s this one small glass oval thing that I have no clue what it is, is there a subreddit to find out the names of odd items? Google didn’t help lol I’m a bit confused -> **edit** I’m told it’s a lid for a casserole dish? Never would’ve thought

# AITAH for cutting off my parents because they plan on leaving almost everything to my disabled brother

My (24f) brother (32m) is a failure to launch. He’s never been very smart. He did badly in school, and never went to college. He tried two different trade schools, welding and mechanic, but he basically flunked out of both. He works at a gas station now.

My brother and I are our parent’s only children. They always treated us relatively equal, until adulthood. They always insisted we earn our own way, they refused to pay for college or anything. I joined the military at 17, got an associates degree while I was in, and my GI bill went towards my bachelors. I’m working towards my masters now. My husband and I have bought a house and have done well for ourselves.

My parents however fully paid for my brother to try trade school twice. They’ve given him cash when he was behind on rent, and countless ‘loans’. They support him cosplaying as an adult, meanwhile they never paid for my wedding, education, nothing. I don’t really care so much that they didn’t give me money, but the disparity in how they’ve treated me vs my brother.

Our parents are in their sixties now, and while they aren’t that old, they’re both in bad health and probably won’t live another ten years. They just recently started working on their will, and notified us that they were leaving almost everything to my brother. But they want me to be their medical power of attorney, manage their estate, etc.

I told my parents to give my brother everything, and that I’m completely done with them. They told me to have some grace, and understand the fact that he isn't very capable and needs their support, even after they’re gone.

My mother had a doctors appointment this morning, and asked me for a ride since she medically can’t work. I told her to ask her favorite child or pay for an Uber.

Things have been tense and hostile. My brother called me to apologize, and asked me to not be mad at him, but I told him that I’m not mad at him, I’m mad at our parents for not treating us equally, and he didn’t do anything wrong.

AITAH?

I meant to put disabled in quotation marks. My mother refers to my brother as disabled even though he isn’t. She’s had him tested for every kind of learning disability there is. He just has a below average IQ. She thinks that counts as a disability when it isn’t.

# UPDATE: AITAH for cutting off my parents to leaving everything to my brother

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/lxI3U5S6GU](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/lxI3U5S6GU)

Hey. So the consensus on my post was a bit of a mixed bag. I sat down with my parents and I wanted to give an update and answer some stuff.

My brother is not actually disabled. He just has a low IQ, just over 80. You need an IQ under 70 where I live to be considered disabled and to qualify for any sort of benefits. My parents have babied him because from a young age he wasn’t as smart as other kids, and had a low self esteem because of that, and was quick to give up on things when they seemed too hard. He does ok on his own now. He works and pays his bills most of the time. He drives and lives with a roommate.

On to the update, I sat down with my parents and explained that I’ve always felt like they treated me worse than my brother. They always emphasized to me that as an adult you need to support yourself, and figure things out on your own. I had to join the military at 17 because I knew they’d kick me out when I was 18. My parents never offered me any support outside of raising me as a child. They didn’t buy my husband and I a wedding gift, they didn’t offer much of anything. Meanwhile they brag about having over a million dollars in the bank, and having succeeded from nothing.

Meanwhile they paid to put my brother through two trade schools that he failed out of, offered him money to start his own business. They’ve always bailed him out when he was short on rent.

For me it’s not so much about the money, but about the disparity in how we’ve been treated. It’s obvious that they loved and cared him him more, because they were willing to do these things for him, and not me.

But despite them not being there for me, I’ve still done really well in life. I told my parents about all of this, and they were interrupting me and talking over me the whole time. They told me I’m not entitled a to dime when they die, and that I’m an adult and I can handle myself. They just weren’t understanding or even caring about my point. They told me I need to step up and treat them better, and that it’s wrong of me to not take my sick mother to the doctor or take care of her because of money.

Eventually I just gave up on trying to talk about my feelings. They just don’t care. I told them that they’re adults, and they’re not entitled to anything from me. Just like how they were never required to help me, I’m not required to help me. I told them to complete remove me from their will, I’m not willing to be their estate executor, medical power of attorney, nothing. I don’t want a dime from them at this point, and I suggested they spend all the money they’ve saved over the years to pay for really good nursing homes, and an estate executor, because I’m no longer willing to do anything for them.

My mother was floored, and asked if I’d really put my own parents in a nursing home. I asked if they’d really let their 17 year old daughter join the army to get sexually harassed by older men in order to go to school without taking on a huge debt.

My parents cried and yelled at me. And I left. And that’s that I guess. I kind of feel relieved, like a massive weight is off my shoulders. I have a wonderful husband, we own a nice home. I’m getting ready to start working on my masters degree, and we’re thinking about maybe having a baby soon. I no longer have to worry about dealing with my parents. They’re adults and they can deal with their own problems, just like I’ve done with mine. And yeah, that’s it. Not sure if it’s the update we wanted, but it is what it is.

Tdlr: My parents wanted to leave almost everything to my older brother because he’s not as successful in life. I feel like my parents have always favored him over me. My parents don’t care about my feelings and won’t listen to them, so I told them our relationship is over. I don’t want anything from them at this point, and I’m moving on.",4258,https://www.reddit.com/r/BORUpdates/comments/1hugzgo/aitah_for_cutting_off_my_parents_because_they/,1736110377.0,BORUpdates,"AITAH for cutting off my parents because they plan on leaving almost everything to my disabled brother I am not OOP.

I told my parents to give my brother everything, and that I’m completely done with them. They told me to have some grace, and understand the fact that he isn't very capable and needs their support, even after they’re gone.

My mother had a doctors appointment this morning, and asked me for a ride since she medically can’t work. I told her to ask her favorite child or pay for an Uber.

Things have been tense and hostile. My brother called me to apologize, and asked me to not be mad at him, but I told him that I’m not mad at him, I’m mad at our parents for not treating us equally, and he didn’t do anything wrong.

AITAH?

I meant to put disabled in quotation marks. My mother refers to my brother as disabled even though he isn’t. She’s had him tested for every kind of learning disability there is. He just has a below average IQ. She thinks that counts as a disability when it isn’t.

# UPDATE: AITAH for cutting off my parents to leaving everything to my brother

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/lxI3U5S6GU](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/lxI3U5S6GU)

Hey. So the consensus on my post was a bit of a mixed bag. I sat down with my parents and I wanted to give an update and answer some stuff.

My brother is not actually disabled. He just has a low IQ, just over 80. You need an IQ under 70 where I live to be considered disabled and to qualify for any sort of benefits. My parents have babied him because from a young age he wasn’t as smart as other kids, and had a low self esteem because of that, and was quick to give up on things when they seemed too hard. He does ok on his own now. He works and pays his bills most of the time. He drives and lives with a roommate.

On to the update, I sat down with my parents and explained that I’ve always felt like they treated me worse than my brother. They always emphasized to me that as an adult you need to support yourself, and figure things out on your own. I had to join the military at 17 because I knew they’d kick me out when I was 18. My parents never offered me any support outside of raising me as a child. They didn’t buy my husband and I a wedding gift, they didn’t offer much of anything. Meanwhile they brag about having over a million dollars in the bank, and having succeeded from nothing.

Meanwhile they paid to put my brother through two trade schools that he failed out of, offered him money to start his own business. They’ve always bailed him out when he was short on rent.

For me it’s not so much about the money, but about the disparity in how we’ve been treated. It’s obvious that they loved and cared him him more, because they were willing to do these things for him, and not me.

But despite them not being there for me, I’ve still done really well in life. I told my parents about all of this, and they were interrupting me and talking over me the whole time. They told me I’m not entitled a to dime when they die, and that I’m an adult and I can handle myself. They just weren’t understanding or even caring about my point. They told me I need to step up and treat them better, and that it’s wrong of me to not take my sick mother to the doctor or take care of her because of money.

Eventually I just gave up on trying to talk about my feelings. They just don’t care. I told them that they’re adults, and they’re not entitled to anything from me. Just like how they were never required to help me, I’m not required to help me. I told them to complete remove me from their will, I’m not willing to be their estate executor, medical power of attorney, nothing. I don’t want a dime from them at this point, and I suggested they spend all the money they’ve saved over the years to pay for really good nursing homes, and an estate executor, because I’m no longer willing to do anything for them.

My mother was floored, and asked if I’d really put my own parents in a nursing home. I asked if they’d really let their 17 year old daughter join the army to get sexually harassed by older men in order to go to school without taking on a huge debt.

My parents cried and yelled at me. And I left. And that’s that I guess. I kind of feel relieved, like a massive weight is off my shoulders. I have a wonderful husband, we own a nice home. I’m getting ready to start working on my masters degree, and we’re thinking about maybe having a baby soon. I no longer have to worry about dealing with my parents. They’re adults and they can deal with their own problems, just like I’ve done with mine. And yeah, that’s it. Not sure if it’s the update we wanted, but it is what it is.

Tdlr: My parents wanted to leave almost everything to my older brother because he’s not as successful in life. I feel like my parents have always favored him over me. My parents don’t care about my feelings and won’t listen to them, so I told them our relationship is over. I don’t want anything from them at this point, and I’m moving on."

AITA for refusing to continue paying for my sister's rent after she went on a trip without telling me?,"My (28f) sister (25f) got laid off about five months ago. She's really struggled to find another job in her since, as it's a really bad for her field, and people are being laid off left and right. She's currently working as a waitress while she looks for a more permanent job, but isn't earning enough to fully cover her rent.

I have a pretty well paying job, and I share rent with my partner, so I offered to help her cover the rent while she looks for another job. She was extremely grateful, and together we agreed on an amount which would allow her to cover rent and also have some money left over for food, travel etc. It's important to note that her monthly expenses for food, travel, bills etc were all provided by her.

I didn't have any issues, or suspect that anything was amiss. She hates working as a waitress so I'm confident that she is doing everything in her power to find another job. The last time I saw her, she mentioned that she has picked up a few extra shifts recently so that she can afford to get our parents a nice anniversary gift, so I figured she was basically living paycheck to paycheck.

Fast forward to now, and I've just received word from our cousin that my sister is in Paris. When I expressed confusion, my cousin sent me a bunch of screenshots from my sister's Instagram. My sister must have blocked me and my parents on there, because none of us could see any of her posts or stories.

I was very confused, then angry, because if she is living paycheck to paycheck, how on earth can she afford to go on a trip to Europe? For context, we live in Australia, and plane tickets typically cost upwards of $1000, and that's not accounting for food, hotels, or anything else.

I was so pissed that not only has she gone on an expensive trip, she clearly tried to hide it from me. I ended up sending her a few short messages, basically saying that I knew she was in Europe and that clearly she doesn't need my help paying rent anymore if she can afford a big trip.

She called me, and was basically in tears begging me not to cut her off. She said that she is on the trip with her new boyfriend, and that he is paying for everything. She insisted that she still needs the money to cover her rent, and that she will have to move if I don't help her. I basically told her that it was her problem now, and hung up, which I admit was childish of me but I was still so mad.

I don't know much about her new boyfriend, so maybe he is a millionaire or something, but the fact that she tried to hide it from me sets off alarm bells. I'll obviously have a proper discussion with her when she gets back, but for now I'm going to block her number.

Since then, she has reached out to some other family members, who think I'm being too harsh and should give her the benefit of the doubt. They all seem to think I'm going to force her to be out on the streets.

It's looking like this will be a whole fiasco once she gets back. I need an outside opinion. AITA?

Update: Thanks for all the responses!

I decided that at the very least I should let my sister explain herself, so I rang her again after I had calmed down. She said that the trip was a very last minute thing, and that her boyfriend was already going to Europe and he offered to pay for her plane ticket so she could come along with him and she felt that it was too good of an offer to pass up. When I asked about other expenses, she told me that he was mostly paying for everything and she only had to contribute a small amount. When I asked her where she got the money for that, she got kinda defensive and said that she had saved some money while working as a waitress, and that it wasn't fair that I was judging her for just trying to have a break, and that's why she didn't tell me.

I did bring up that he could help her pay rent, but she said that they hadn't been dating for that long, and she doesn't feel comfortable asking him. I think he comes from quite a well-off family, and she doesn't want to come across like a gold-digger. I do get this, I think it would be weird to ask someone you hadn't known for that long.

I do believe her for the most part, but I'm still pissed that she didn't tell me and that she clearly did have some money saved that could have been used to contribute to rent. I'm also pretty convinced that the money she said would go towards a gift for our parents also got spent on the trip, which feels a bit scummy.

I did stand my ground about no longer paying her rent, but I did agree to discuss it again once she got back. However, I will definitely ask to see her bank statements before I give her a cent more, and if it turns out she has been scamming me then not only will I not give her any more money but I will make her pay back what I loaned her.",4981,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1e68vi8/aita_for_refusing_to_continue_paying_for_my/,1721301365.0,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for refusing to continue paying for my sister's rent after she went on a trip without telling me?

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/f3utz0/becoming_a_legal_guardian_to_my_adult_cousin_who/): **February 14, 2020**

The whole situation is a huge mess, so I'll have to describe it in length. Apologies for the wall of text.

This is about my cousin, let's call him Jimmy. Jimmy is a developmentally disabled adult. He's in his late 40s but has the cognitive abilities of an 8 year old child. He has always lived with his mother, she took care of him until she passed suddenly at the beginning of last year. Jimmy isn't capable of holding a real job, he does odd jobs for people in town and on the nearby farms and gets paid cash. He and his Mom lived on what little cash he brought home and what I suppose was his Mom's Social Security from how he describes it. They were very poor but were capable of buying the basic necessities, and their neighbors gave them second-hand clothes or things they didn't need anymore. From what I understand his Mom owned their house, which is quite small and in a derelict state, and some land were they have a few chicken and a garden where they grow vegetables. They are simple people from a rural area who live on very little.

Jimmy is partially capable of living on his own, that is, he can do some basic cooking, do the laundry, the housecleaning and the groceries if it's a store he knows. He also takes care of the chicken and the garden. But he can't drive, can barely read, and is not really capable of functionning in an environment he doesn't know. He can't take care of anything like paying the bills, filing taxes, he doesn't have a bank account or anything like that. He's also shy and afraid of strangers. He keeps his cash in a box and knows not to spend more than he has but doesn't really have a fine grasp of how money works. I should add that he's the kindest person I know and a hardworking man who never complains about anything.

After his Mom's passing, Jimmy stayed alone in their home, with no one to take care of him. He has lived there since then, about a year ago. I was out of state for years and only just came back and decided to go see how he was doing. I was shocked to see that although he has organized his life the best he could, he lives in absolute poverty. There's no working AC in his home, and no heating to speak of. He hasn't paid the bills, probalby doesn't know how to, so he has no electricity and no phone. Thankfully he has a well he can pump water from. He keeps himself clean but with no hot water. It's like he was living in the 19th century. He survives on what little he makes doing odd jobs, buys some groceries and eats the vegetables he grows and eggs from his chicken, but it's not enough to feed him properly, especially in the winter. It seems that he's been left to live alone after his mom died and has not reached out for help, and no one has given him a hand either. I was very surprised that he wasn't visited by Adult Protective Services or anything like that after his Mom's passing, he clearly needs help and is not capable of asking for it.

He needs a guardian but doesn't have one. His mother was his actual guardian but that was never made official. He always lived with her and it looks like she never took any disposition about what would become of him after she died. She was a loving mother but she wasn't very socially adapted herself. I and my siblings are the last family he has. I'd like to become his guardian because I think he needs help but I know that he needs to go on living like he's used to, because removing him from his house would kill him. I don't think there's any way Adult Protective Services will let him live in his house but that's what he needs, with help from a guardian of course. His whole life revolves around his garden, his animals, fishing and taking long walks in the woods. He's capable of organizing his life in the conditions he's used to. However he completely shuts down when he's with strangers in places he doesn't know, I've witnessed that. Putting him in a home somewhere would be terrible for him. I inherited a house in a nearby town and I'm planning to settle there, so I could check on him, he seems to be OK with that. I've reached out to his Mom's church's pastor and he thinks he could have church members organize a ""watch"" to go see him regularly and help him.

I thought I would help him get help from services, and help him file for SSDI because he's physically fit to work but can't realistically hold a job and he is disabled. But as I did so I wasn't able to find an ID, a birth certificate, a SSN or anything. I searched the whole house thoroughly but couldn't find anything. He doesn't have a driving license, or any kind of ID. He's never filed taxes or anything official like that. He has no idea what a birth certificate even is. I'm starting to suspect that Jimmy's mother never bothered to register his birth. That wouldn't be so surprising coming from her.

So I have a lot of questions :

1. How can I legally become my cousin's guardian?

2. How do I proceed to find if he has a birth certificate somewhere, and a legal exsitence?

3. If he doesn't, how can he be registered?

4. What services can a disabled adult in his situation receive?

5. Jimmy's Mom owned their house, so I suppose he automatically inherited it as her next of kin. However I couldn't find a copy of a deed in the house. Where could I get that? And how do I make sure that Jimmy is/becomes the rightful the owner of his house and can stay in it? It would be a nightmare for him if he had to leave his land.

**Edit:** we're in Oklahoma

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** You need a family law attorney that specializes in guardianship cases to handle this. Your wall of text isn't even close to enough information to give you a super accurate picture, and the only way for you to navigate this with as little damage as possible to Jimmy is by attorney.

1. You can legally become your cousin's guardian by petitioning the court for guardianship. You will have to take a class on what that means, and potentially do some extensive paperwork. Sadly, there will be no way to accomplish this easily as Jimmy will have to be evaluated for guardianship (because he likely was never formally assigned a guardian by the state). This means going to mental health professionals, visits from APS, many many people will enter his life if only briefly to evaluate if he is safe, competent, etc. Without a lawyer, and no guardian, the state will have to immediately take him out of the situation he is currently in if they determine he is mentally unable to care for himself (which is likely given your description of his living conditions without power). With a lawyer, you may still have this problem, but the lawyer could potentially mitigate the issues.

2. If you have his birthday, you can find out this information. It would also be helpful to have his mother's death certificate as it provides information that would be helpful in researching (date of birth, full name, etc.. This will cost at most a few hundred dollars with a manual record search in the county birth registry, likely it would be less.

3. You would petition the court to do this with the county birth registry, there is a process for doing this that would be easier with a court order.

4. There are many many services he would be entitled to as a disabled adult. Too many to list and they all have complicated hoops to jump through to qualify.

5. Start with the property appraiser's office to get the information the county has on the property, this will allow you to do a title/deed search with county records. As a guardian, you could put the house into probate as the agent of the sole heir and get it transferred to him.

All this is to say that while Jimmy may enjoy living in his own little world, you would need to seriously understand that societally this is viewed very negatively. During his evaluation, a caseworker may decide that Jimmy can not live on his own, and a judge is almost always going to then follow that determination. You're doing the right thing trying to step up, just be prepared for how different the landscape may look at the end of the journey.

> **OOP:** Thank you for your detailed answer, much appreciated. Yes I'm aware things may not go the way I imagine. I'm torn honestly. I can't let him live in his current conditions, it would be cruel and downright neglect. I'm mad that his neighbors let him live like that and didn't do anything. On the surface he looks like he manages, and he's proud of his perceived independence, but when you know him you know he needs help.
> 
> A the same time if he has to move he will hate it. I convinced him to stay with me for a while in the house I'm renovating but after four days he said he wanted to go home and I couldn't convince him otherwise. I haven't found a good solution yet.
> 
> As for your first point, you're right of course, but I know Jimmy will hate being prodded by social workers and doctors. I know it's for his own good but he can be very stubborn and it's going to be tough. I hope they let me or someone he trusts be with him for this.
> 
> Edit: I must add that I have paid his bills and given him food and blankets so his conditions are a little less dire but there's still a lot of work to do in the house.

**Commenter 2:** Consider having him visit your home for one or two days every week. He may become more comfortable there with time.

If he's required to leave his home, that would make the transition less stressful for him.

> **OOP:** It might be a solution indeed. I'm quite willing to let him live with me on my property if he wants.

**Commenter 3:** I would come up with some tasks he can do at your new house. It may take his mind of of wanting to go home. Hopefully any social workers and doctors would be willing to meet him and build some trust before trying to treat him. Best of luck. I hope it works out for you. You are an amazing person.

> **OOP:** I definitely plan to hire him to help me renovate my house. He's a surprisingly good handyman. My hope is that if he renovates a room with bath and a kitchen for himself, he'd be willing to live there.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fgdc2l/update_to_my_post_about_becoming_a_guardian_to_my/): **March 10, 2020 (almost one month later)** 

This is an update to [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/f3utz0/becoming_a_legal_guardian_to_my_adult_cousin_who/) because people were worrying about my cousin and kindly asking for news (I hope this one doesn't break the rules of the sub).

First the good news: I've found an arrangement with my cousin, it took a lot of persuasion but he agreed to spend his nights at my place while we do some badly needed repairs to his house. At least he has a warm and safe place to sleep and I can make sure he has a real dinner. He develops anxiety when he needs to change his routine and this is a major change for him, I'm proud of him for being willing to try. I drop him at his house in the morning and either we do some work there or I go to work and he spends his day as he's used to, tending to his animals and his garden and hiking (he says he needs to hike every day, even in terrible weather, otherwise he feels ""trapped"" and gets nervous). Then I pick him up in the evening and we go to my place. He seems OK with this arrangement for now, I'm not sure how long it's going to last but for now we're fine. He's grieving his mother and spending time in the place where they lived together seems to comfort him, but I feel better knowing he's not spending his nights alone over there in a crumbling house.

Abous the rest, now: things are going to be complicated. I haven't been able to find anything about Jimmy's birth certificate in the county records. There isn't a deed for his house in the records either. I have no idea who could be the owner of this house and the land around it. I'm meeting with a lawyer soon to talk about the guardianship issues, and we'll need to discuss the rest too. I really hope that trying to become his guardian officially isn't going to do more harm than good, and that he won't end up losing his house or being forced to live somewhere else against his will. I'm afraid this is going to be an uphill battle but I'm ready.

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/k6nhr8/update_i_finally_became_a_guardian_to_my_adult/): **December 4, 2020 (almost nine months later)** 

Update to my post about my cousin Jimmy. First of all, warm thanks to all the people who checked on us. I'm here to share good news.

I finally got guardianship of my cousin after a hearing with a judge. It was a tedious process with lots of paperwork but it worked in the end. I hired a lawyer who was very helpful.

Jimmy and I received visits from social services and doctors to evaluate him. Jimmy was not really happy with this as talking to people he doesn't know gives him anxiety, but he did his best. He was formally evaluated for his disability, which had not been done since he was a kid. The social workers determined, as I had, that he couldn't stay in his home, but they agreed that he was safe with me. I was afraid they would remove him but they were really helpful and agreed that the best place for him is with me. He will also be receiving services from the state which will be a good thing, especially for his access to health care.

We finished renovating a room with a bathroom and a little kitchen for him in my house, this way he lives with me but he has privacy when he wants to be alone. He worked hard with me on this project and we're both quite happy with the result. He seems to have accepted that he couldn't spend his nights at his house anymore. We built a chicken coop and brought his chickens to my property (it was quite the fun transporting 11 chickens in a pick-up truck). He has also started to do some gardening and he helps me around the house. The house I'm renovating was in a very poor state so there's no shortage of work to be done. Jimmy keeps himself busy and he gets to exercise as much as he needs so he's feeling well. I still drive him to his house regularly so he can fish in the creek and hike on the paths he knows. We're exploring the nature near my home so he can find new places to hike.

On a side note we finally found Jimmy's birth certificate, with great difficulty because he was registered under his mother's maiden name and with a different first name. From what I heard from the few people who knew his parents when they were young, they didn't trust the government and came to live on an isolated farm to not be bothered by anyone. It looks like they tried to ""hide"" their son's birth by registering him under another name. It might have looked like a good idea at the time, but it certainly didn't help us.

Anyway I'm quite pleased with the way the situation turned out, Jimmy now has a safe place to stay and someone to take care of him and he looks happy with his new life.

This is about my cousin, let's call him Jimmy. Jimmy is a developmentally disabled adult. He's in his late 40s but has the cognitive abilities of an 8 year old child. He has always lived with his mother, she took care of him until she passed suddenly at the beginning of last year. Jimmy isn't capable of holding a real job, he does odd jobs for people in town and on the nearby farms and gets paid cash. He and his Mom lived on what little cash he brought home and what I suppose was his Mom's Social Security from how he describes it. They were very poor but were capable of buying the basic necessities, and their neighbors gave them second-hand clothes or things they didn't need anymore. From what I understand his Mom owned their house, which is quite small and in a derelict state, and some land were they have a few chicken and a garden where they grow vegetables. They are simple people from a rural area who live on very little.

Jimmy is partially capable of living on his own, that is, he can do some basic cooking, do the laundry, the housecleaning and the groceries if it's a store he knows. He also takes care of the chicken and the garden. But he can't drive, can barely read, and is not really capable of functionning in an environment he doesn't know. He can't take care of anything like paying the bills, filing taxes, he doesn't have a bank account or anything like that. He's also shy and afraid of strangers. He keeps his cash in a box and knows not to spend more than he has but doesn't really have a fine grasp of how money works. I should add that he's the kindest person I know and a hardworking man who never complains about anything.

After his Mom's passing, Jimmy stayed alone in their home, with no one to take care of him. He has lived there since then, about a year ago. I was out of state for years and only just came back and decided to go see how he was doing. I was shocked to see that although he has organized his life the best he could, he lives in absolute poverty. There's no working AC in his home, and no heating to speak of. He hasn't paid the bills, probalby doesn't know how to, so he has no electricity and no phone. Thankfully he has a well he can pump water from. He keeps himself clean but with no hot water. It's like he was living in the 19th century. He survives on what little he makes doing odd jobs, buys some groceries and eats the vegetables he grows and eggs from his chicken, but it's not enough to feed him properly, especially in the winter. It seems that he's been left to live alone after his mom died and has not reached out for help, and no one has given him a hand either. I was very surprised that he wasn't visited by Adult Protective Services or anything like that after his Mom's passing, he clearly needs help and is not capable of asking for it.

He needs a guardian but doesn't have one. His mother was his actual guardian but that was never made official. He always lived with her and it looks like she never took any disposition about what would become of him after she died. She was a loving mother but she wasn't very socially adapted herself. I and my siblings are the last family he has. I'd like to become his guardian because I think he needs help but I know that he needs to go on living like he's used to, because removing him from his house would kill him. I don't think there's any way Adult Protective Services will let him live in his house but that's what he needs, with help from a guardian of course. His whole life revolves around his garden, his animals, fishing and taking long walks in the woods. He's capable of organizing his life in the conditions he's used to. However he completely shuts down when he's with strangers in places he doesn't know, I've witnessed that. Putting him in a home somewhere would be terrible for him. I inherited a house in a nearby town and I'm planning to settle there, so I could check on him, he seems to be OK with that. I've reached out to his Mom's church's pastor and he thinks he could have church members organize a ""watch"" to go see him regularly and help him.

I thought I would help him get help from services, and help him file for SSDI because he's physically fit to work but can't realistically hold a job and he is disabled. But as I did so I wasn't able to find an ID, a birth certificate, a SSN or anything. I searched the whole house thoroughly but couldn't find anything. He doesn't have a driving license, or any kind of ID. He's never filed taxes or anything official like that. He has no idea what a birth certificate even is. I'm starting to suspect that Jimmy's mother never bothered to register his birth. That wouldn't be so surprising coming from her.

So I have a lot of questions :

1. How can I legally become my cousin's guardian?

2. How do I proceed to find if he has a birth certificate somewhere, and a legal exsitence?

3. If he doesn't, how can he be registered?

4. What services can a disabled adult in his situation receive?

5. Jimmy's Mom owned their house, so I suppose he automatically inherited it as her next of kin. However I couldn't find a copy of a deed in the house. Where could I get that? And how do I make sure that Jimmy is/becomes the rightful the owner of his house and can stay in it? It would be a nightmare for him if he had to leave his land.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** You need a family law attorney that specializes in guardianship cases to handle this. Your wall of text isn't even close to enough information to give you a super accurate picture, and the only way for you to navigate this with as little damage as possible to Jimmy is by attorney.

1. You can legally become your cousin's guardian by petitioning the court for guardianship. You will have to take a class on what that means, and potentially do some extensive paperwork. Sadly, there will be no way to accomplish this easily as Jimmy will have to be evaluated for guardianship (because he likely was never formally assigned a guardian by the state). This means going to mental health professionals, visits from APS, many many people will enter his life if only briefly to evaluate if he is safe, competent, etc. Without a lawyer, and no guardian, the state will have to immediately take him out of the situation he is currently in if they determine he is mentally unable to care for himself (which is likely given your description of his living conditions without power). With a lawyer, you may still have this problem, but the lawyer could potentially mitigate the issues.

2. If you have his birthday, you can find out this information. It would also be helpful to have his mother's death certificate as it provides information that would be helpful in researching (date of birth, full name, etc.. This will cost at most a few hundred dollars with a manual record search in the county birth registry, likely it would be less.

3. You would petition the court to do this with the county birth registry, there is a process for doing this that would be easier with a court order.

4. There are many many services he would be entitled to as a disabled adult. Too many to list and they all have complicated hoops to jump through to qualify.

5. Start with the property appraiser's office to get the information the county has on the property, this will allow you to do a title/deed search with county records. As a guardian, you could put the house into probate as the agent of the sole heir and get it transferred to him.

All this is to say that while Jimmy may enjoy living in his own little world, you would need to seriously understand that societally this is viewed very negatively. During his evaluation, a caseworker may decide that Jimmy can not live on his own, and a judge is almost always going to then follow that determination. You're doing the right thing trying to step up, just be prepared for how different the landscape may look at the end of the journey.

> **OOP:** Thank you for your detailed answer, much appreciated. Yes I'm aware things may not go the way I imagine. I'm torn honestly. I can't let him live in his current conditions, it would be cruel and downright neglect. I'm mad that his neighbors let him live like that and didn't do anything. On the surface he looks like he manages, and he's proud of his perceived independence, but when you know him you know he needs help.
> 
> A the same time if he has to move he will hate it. I convinced him to stay with me for a while in the house I'm renovating but after four days he said he wanted to go home and I couldn't convince him otherwise. I haven't found a good solution yet.
> 
> As for your first point, you're right of course, but I know Jimmy will hate being prodded by social workers and doctors. I know it's for his own good but he can be very stubborn and it's going to be tough. I hope they let me or someone he trusts be with him for this.
> 
> Edit: I must add that I have paid his bills and given him food and blankets so his conditions are a little less dire but there's still a lot of work to do in the house.

**Commenter 2:** Consider having him visit your home for one or two days every week. He may become more comfortable there with time.

If he's required to leave his home, that would make the transition less stressful for him.

> **OOP:** It might be a solution indeed. I'm quite willing to let him live with me on my property if he wants.

**Commenter 3:** I would come up with some tasks he can do at your new house. It may take his mind of of wanting to go home. Hopefully any social workers and doctors would be willing to meet him and build some trust before trying to treat him. Best of luck. I hope it works out for you. You are an amazing person.

> **OOP:** I definitely plan to hire him to help me renovate my house. He's a surprisingly good handyman. My hope is that if he renovates a room with bath and a kitchen for himself, he'd be willing to live there.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fgdc2l/update_to_my_post_about_becoming_a_guardian_to_my/): **March 10, 2020 (almost one month later)** 

This is an update to [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/f3utz0/becoming_a_legal_guardian_to_my_adult_cousin_who/) because people were worrying about my cousin and kindly asking for news (I hope this one doesn't break the rules of the sub).

First the good news: I've found an arrangement with my cousin, it took a lot of persuasion but he agreed to spend his nights at my place while we do some badly needed repairs to his house. At least he has a warm and safe place to sleep and I can make sure he has a real dinner. He develops anxiety when he needs to change his routine and this is a major change for him, I'm proud of him for being willing to try. I drop him at his house in the morning and either we do some work there or I go to work and he spends his day as he's used to, tending to his animals and his garden and hiking (he says he needs to hike every day, even in terrible weather, otherwise he feels ""trapped"" and gets nervous). Then I pick him up in the evening and we go to my place. He seems OK with this arrangement for now, I'm not sure how long it's going to last but for now we're fine. He's grieving his mother and spending time in the place where they lived together seems to comfort him, but I feel better knowing he's not spending his nights alone over there in a crumbling house.

Abous the rest, now: things are going to be complicated. I haven't been able to find anything about Jimmy's birth certificate in the county records. There isn't a deed for his house in the records either. I have no idea who could be the owner of this house and the land around it. I'm meeting with a lawyer soon to talk about the guardianship issues, and we'll need to discuss the rest too. I really hope that trying to become his guardian officially isn't going to do more harm than good, and that he won't end up losing his house or being forced to live somewhere else against his will. I'm afraid this is going to be an uphill battle but I'm ready.

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/k6nhr8/update_i_finally_became_a_guardian_to_my_adult/): **December 4, 2020 (almost nine months later)** 

Update to my post about my cousin Jimmy. First of all, warm thanks to all the people who checked on us. I'm here to share good news.

I finally got guardianship of my cousin after a hearing with a judge. It was a tedious process with lots of paperwork but it worked in the end. I hired a lawyer who was very helpful.

Jimmy and I received visits from social services and doctors to evaluate him. Jimmy was not really happy with this as talking to people he doesn't know gives him anxiety, but he did his best. He was formally evaluated for his disability, which had not been done since he was a kid. The social workers determined, as I had, that he couldn't stay in his home, but they agreed that he was safe with me. I was afraid they would remove him but they were really helpful and agreed that the best place for him is with me. He will also be receiving services from the state which will be a good thing, especially for his access to health care.

We finished renovating a room with a bathroom and a little kitchen for him in my house, this way he lives with me but he has privacy when he wants to be alone. He worked hard with me on this project and we're both quite happy with the result. He seems to have accepted that he couldn't spend his nights at his house anymore. We built a chicken coop and brought his chickens to my property (it was quite the fun transporting 11 chickens in a pick-up truck). He has also started to do some gardening and he helps me around the house. The house I'm renovating was in a very poor state so there's no shortage of work to be done. Jimmy keeps himself busy and he gets to exercise as much as he needs so he's feeling well. I still drive him to his house regularly so he can fish in the creek and hike on the paths he knows. We're exploring the nature near my home so he can find new places to hike.

On a side note we finally found Jimmy's birth certificate, with great difficulty because he was registered under his mother's maiden name and with a different first name. From what I heard from the few people who knew his parents when they were young, they didn't trust the government and came to live on an isolated farm to not be bothered by anyone. It looks like they tried to ""hide"" their son's birth by registering him under another name. It might have looked like a good idea at the time, but it certainly didn't help us.

Anyway I'm quite pleased with the way the situation turned out, Jimmy now has a safe place to stay and someone to take care of him and he looks happy with his new life.

"Update 2: AITA for refusing to pay my sister’s wedding expenses after she called my child a ""mistake""? ","Edit to add the same trigger warnings as before sorry for forgetting - my brain is chaotic - TW: abuse, self harm, substance abuse, death, violence

I kept my promise to my wife to wait before reacting. She knows me best and knew I was prepared to go nuclear. Turns out, I needn't have bothered. 

Let me clear up a couple of small details and misconceptions I've read.

1. I am the eldest of the siblings. Mom and Dad have been sick for years on and off. So to those who think I've just started taken over as some weird power trip or something, no. I've managed their finances, maintained their properties, and taken care of all their affairs before either of them passed. Dad simply wasn't mentally able after a while and mom never had a head for that sort of thing.

2. Yes, I was mostly left in charge of my siblings growing up. Both my parents had businesses and worked often 7 day weeks. I cooked dinner and helped with homework and whatnot. I'm aware that's not very normal, and I already know some of you will call my parents terrible for this but they simply didn't know better. I won't hate them for any of it and as much as it caused me some negative effects, it also made my siblings feel safe. I'm proud of being able to protect them and be there for them when they were young so they didn't feel how I felt. And yes, I am also in therapy.

3. I was the sole caretaker of my parents when they passed. The reasons are complicated but the short of it is, Dad got verbally abusive towards the end and mom got severely depressed and blunt. They were a challenge to deal with on the best of days. I hold no ill will towards them, but there it is. My siblings didn't want to be around them. Dad was hurt and changed his will. Mom followed suit. 

4. For those telling me I am ""rewarding"" Clara by paying for literally this month, and that I'm not a real mom or a bad mom by loving my daughter's tormentor, I'm envious your world is so black and white. Rent is literally due today and the money was already in transfer to her via auto-banking. And Clara isn't getting rewarded, she is remaining *housed*. But from now on, she's on her own. 

5. Clara and I used to be pretty close but she did get distant around the time Decker was adopted. I didn't know exactly why, just that the new dynamic was a challenge for her. I know she *hates* Charlie and considers him evil and irredeemable. She had a really hard time losing our cousin-in-law, Decker's biological mother, as they were very close so I assume her issues stem from this.

7. I inherited the majority of everything though my siblings got sizable sums, 3 got all but one of the businesses my parents owned, and everyone got trusts. Clara spiraled after mom passed and had a mental health crisis. Before we got her help, she traveled, drank, and gambled away her entire inheritance. Long story for another time.

I didn't have a moment to cool down and wait until today to give myself a chance to make a level-headed decision regarding my sister. Clara has spun the tale that I am jealous she found a loving man and am withholding mom and dad's money from her. She gave the perception that I was the one abusing Decker, putting her down, and telling her she isn't my real daughter. That shut down when I sent my text a couple days ago.

Yesterday, Clara was on my doorstep. She was crying and begging for me to let her in but my wife and her friends were inside and I made it clear I don't want her near my family as she emotionally abused my daughter and physically harmed my wife. I told her to leave or I would call the police to have her removed. I was going to call the police anyway because I told her never to come to our home again and there she was. There's a reason I said this in text, so I could -in an event like this- show them clear as day that she would know she is welcome.

Clara started to beg saying she will apologize to Decker and she was drunk and upset and made mistakes. I could tell she was drunk. Or high. Or somethkng. I told her it's not a simple ""mistake"" to bully a traumatized teen girl and make her feel unloved and unwanted by her own family and to text her that she is worthless and expendable. What the fuck!?

I got angry and just started to raise my voice. I dont know when I started to yell but I did. I just...lost it.

She's a cold-hearted, awful, self-serving brat. Spoiled beyond belief to being so delusional that this all would just go away - that's she's *entitled* to the money my wife and I make, that our parents gave us after all she did. She needs fucking help and I am done being the giving tree here. You don't ever hurt my child. She's lucky I have a head to keep my hands to myself and luckier still Honey isn't out here because she certainly would not so go the fuck home. 

Clara slapped me across the face and called me a bitch and a traitor that I choose that ""demon spawn"" of a child over her. That I love Decker more than my own real family and turn my back on her this way. 

Honey must have been right by the door because before I could make a *very* bad choice she had yanked me inside, told my sister that she had 60 seconds to fuck off and slammed the door closed.

Clara left quickly but we still called the police and handed over the footage from our property cameras of what happened, as well as the texts from our phones. Clara went ballistic over text telling me awful things ending with her hoping I take my own life and she would celebrate. Absolutely unhinged awful shit like that. I blocked her, sent every piece of footage In a google drive and dropped the link in the sibling group chat and sent it to ""Kevin"" her fiance. 

I then sat down and cried myself into a fit before Decker  came home from practice. I put on my ""mom"" face for her and made sure she did her homework then I went to the den and called my aunt - Decker's biological grandmother - and told her what happened.

My aunt told me that Clara is renewing her conspiracy that I harming Decker and that I need to be careful because she suspects Clara is having some sort of mental break and might do something crazy. 

Honey and I have spent this whole day working on a request for a protective order from her. Making sure Decker's school knows no one is to pick her up but us. And get a lawyer because I think legal action is needed here. I told my eldest of the brothers that Clara needs help and asked if he could check on her because she might be as much a danger to herself as she is now presenting to be to me and my family. He got quiet and said ""Can't you handle this?"" And said this drama was too much and he's busy.

I was so stunned I just blurted out ""Are you fucking kidding me right now?"" Before I just hung up. My other sister is now over, helping me deal with this. My other brother has gone to see after Clara, but says he will only make sure she hasn't hurt herself but beyond that she can get wrecked for what she's done.

Kevin called me and said he went through the Google drive and begged me not to call the police on Clara. He said that she has been having a really bad time, and has struggled with drinking and has been stealing his medications and he's trying to get her help. But if she gets arrested, he doesn't have the funds for bail pr any legal help. I told him it's too late. The police have been called and he needs to get her into some sort of rehab or something. He asked for our help to pay for a facility he was thinking of and I told him to keep her away from me and my family.

He started to cry and told me I'm am awful sister. That i don't care about Clara and her struggles and that she's just lost and he's underwater trying to keep her from going off a deep end. I didn't reply after that and have just been sitting around the house waiting for the police to call back, trying to get my crying out fo the way before Decker comes home from school.

I feel wretched and terrible because not matter what I do now, it will just never feel right. I was to look after them all and now my sister is this lunatic hellbent on burning my life down and my brother is alarmingly just indifferent to it all. I am used to being the one that holds the family together and handle things. But I don't feel like I can handle anything anymore. Wtf is my life? ",4947,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fuoobh/update_2_aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_sisters/,1727897057.0,AITAH,"Update 2: AITA for refusing to pay my sister’s wedding expenses after she called my child a ""mistake""?  Edit to add the same trigger warnings as before sorry for forgetting - my brain is chaotic - TW: abuse, self harm, substance abuse, death, violence

I kept my promise to my wife to wait before reacting. She knows me best and knew I was prepared to go nuclear. Turns out, I needn't have bothered. 

Let me clear up a couple of small details and misconceptions I've read.

1. I am the eldest of the siblings. Mom and Dad have been sick for years on and off. So to those who think I've just started taken over as some weird power trip or something, no. I've managed their finances, maintained their properties, and taken care of all their affairs before either of them passed. Dad simply wasn't mentally able after a while and mom never had a head for that sort of thing.

2. Yes, I was mostly left in charge of my siblings growing up. Both my parents had businesses and worked often 7 day weeks. I cooked dinner and helped with homework and whatnot. I'm aware that's not very normal, and I already know some of you will call my parents terrible for this but they simply didn't know better. I won't hate them for any of it and as much as it caused me some negative effects, it also made my siblings feel safe. I'm proud of being able to protect them and be there for them when they were young so they didn't feel how I felt. And yes, I am also in therapy.

3. I was the sole caretaker of my parents when they passed. The reasons are complicated but the short of it is, Dad got verbally abusive towards the end and mom got severely depressed and blunt. They were a challenge to deal with on the best of days. I hold no ill will towards them, but there it is. My siblings didn't want to be around them. Dad was hurt and changed his will. Mom followed suit. 

4. For those telling me I am ""rewarding"" Clara by paying for literally this month, and that I'm not a real mom or a bad mom by loving my daughter's tormentor, I'm envious your world is so black and white. Rent is literally due today and the money was already in transfer to her via auto-banking. And Clara isn't getting rewarded, she is remaining *housed*. But from now on, she's on her own. 

5. Clara and I used to be pretty close but she did get distant around the time Decker was adopted. I didn't know exactly why, just that the new dynamic was a challenge for her. I know she *hates* Charlie and considers him evil and irredeemable. She had a really hard time losing our cousin-in-law, Decker's biological mother, as they were very close so I assume her issues stem from this.

7. I inherited the majority of everything though my siblings got sizable sums, 3 got all but one of the businesses my parents owned, and everyone got trusts. Clara spiraled after mom passed and had a mental health crisis. Before we got her help, she traveled, drank, and gambled away her entire inheritance. Long story for another time.

I didn't have a moment to cool down and wait until today to give myself a chance to make a level-headed decision regarding my sister. Clara has spun the tale that I am jealous she found a loving man and am withholding mom and dad's money from her. She gave the perception that I was the one abusing Decker, putting her down, and telling her she isn't my real daughter. That shut down when I sent my text a couple days ago.

Yesterday, Clara was on my doorstep. She was crying and begging for me to let her in but my wife and her friends were inside and I made it clear I don't want her near my family as she emotionally abused my daughter and physically harmed my wife. I told her to leave or I would call the police to have her removed. I was going to call the police anyway because I told her never to come to our home again and there she was. There's a reason I said this in text, so I could -in an event like this- show them clear as day that she would know she is welcome.

Clara started to beg saying she will apologize to Decker and she was drunk and upset and made mistakes. I could tell she was drunk. Or high. Or somethkng. I told her it's not a simple ""mistake"" to bully a traumatized teen girl and make her feel unloved and unwanted by her own family and to text her that she is worthless and expendable. What the fuck!?

I got angry and just started to raise my voice. I dont know when I started to yell but I did. I just...lost it.

She's a cold-hearted, awful, self-serving brat. Spoiled beyond belief to being so delusional that this all would just go away - that's she's *entitled* to the money my wife and I make, that our parents gave us after all she did. She needs fucking help and I am done being the giving tree here. You don't ever hurt my child. She's lucky I have a head to keep my hands to myself and luckier still Honey isn't out here because she certainly would not so go the fuck home. 

Clara slapped me across the face and called me a bitch and a traitor that I choose that ""demon spawn"" of a child over her. That I love Decker more than my own real family and turn my back on her this way. 

Honey must have been right by the door because before I could make a *very* bad choice she had yanked me inside, told my sister that she had 60 seconds to fuck off and slammed the door closed.

Clara left quickly but we still called the police and handed over the footage from our property cameras of what happened, as well as the texts from our phones. Clara went ballistic over text telling me awful things ending with her hoping I take my own life and she would celebrate. Absolutely unhinged awful shit like that. I blocked her, sent every piece of footage In a google drive and dropped the link in the sibling group chat and sent it to ""Kevin"" her fiance. 

I then sat down and cried myself into a fit before Decker  came home from practice. I put on my ""mom"" face for her and made sure she did her homework then I went to the den and called my aunt - Decker's biological grandmother - and told her what happened.

My aunt told me that Clara is renewing her conspiracy that I harming Decker and that I need to be careful because she suspects Clara is having some sort of mental break and might do something crazy. 

Honey and I have spent this whole day working on a request for a protective order from her. Making sure Decker's school knows no one is to pick her up but us. And get a lawyer because I think legal action is needed here. I told my eldest of the brothers that Clara needs help and asked if he could check on her because she might be as much a danger to herself as she is now presenting to be to me and my family. He got quiet and said ""Can't you handle this?"" And said this drama was too much and he's busy.

I was so stunned I just blurted out ""Are you fucking kidding me right now?"" Before I just hung up. My other sister is now over, helping me deal with this. My other brother has gone to see after Clara, but says he will only make sure she hasn't hurt herself but beyond that she can get wrecked for what she's done.

Kevin called me and said he went through the Google drive and begged me not to call the police on Clara. He said that she has been having a really bad time, and has struggled with drinking and has been stealing his medications and he's trying to get her help. But if she gets arrested, he doesn't have the funds for bail pr any legal help. I told him it's too late. The police have been called and he needs to get her into some sort of rehab or something.

I am used to being the one that holds the family together and handle things. But I don't feel like I can handle anything anymore. Wtf is my life? "

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/wsEOHLyVYK)  **Apr 27, 2024** 

Throwaway account as my husband and In-laws are follow my main. I, 29 F, have been married to my husband, 30 m, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I met in college during our freshman year. We started off as just friends, and got married seven months ago. I've gotten along with his family, but we aren't super close but we're friendly enough. The problem is that Alex has begun to make me incredibly uncomfortable. 

Firstly, he's begun to ask me who I'm meeting with, where, what we plan on doing, how long every single time I leave the house without him. At first, I just thought he was being protective and a good partner just in case something happened, but then he started checking my phone after the visits, vetting and researching each of my friends as well. 

He also has been pursuing me to link my bank account to his, as he's ""in charge"" of the finances when he was perfectly fine with keeping them separate before. We fight about it almost every day. 

Finally, yesterday when he was preparing to go on a work trip for two weeks in California, he demanded I wear a tracker so he could keep and eye on me while he's gone. I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm suffocating and his family who I've spoken to about his worrying behavior just said he's being careful and protective as a good husband should. I need to gather my things together and find a way to be gone before he gets home without tipping him off. 

He's always threatened that if he ever found me cheating on him he'd turn in divorce papers the same day. He keeps a filled out copy in his desk. I'm going to submit those the day I leave. But there's so much to do, bergen finding a new place to live, seeing if my job has any transfers available, packing and moving in two weeks. His return flight  May 11th, so I need to move quickly. I'm posting here because I don't have any close family, and I can't risk dragging my friends into this as we share the same friends.I just needed a place to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice on the easiest and safest way to do this? 

Edit: oh my god you guys are amazing! I never even thought to not use his divorce papers. I'll check for cameras before I start any packing or prepping. I may also shred his divorce papers just in case and look into getting a lawyer for myself. I'm in a no fault divorce state, that much I so remember which will help. I'll update again when I know more. The tracker he wants me to use is a small clip to put on the belt or waistband. I'll wear it unless I'm going or doing something related to me leaving. No pets yet thankfully.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/v6qRzYi8XD)  **Apr 28, 2024** 

So I've gotten a lot of support and helpful advice along with questions I thought I should clarify before I proceed with the update. Some asked why I'd be 'hiding' things from Alex regarding going out and who I'm meeting with. I don't, and I have nothing to hide. However when he begins to then double check everything I tell him with the other people there right down to each person I talked to and what I said. Did I send any text msgs, did I order food, how much did I eat, that's when it started to feel like I was slowly being pushed into a corner. It didn't start that bad, but gradually grew worse overtime. 

All of the Reddit subs my in-law's families are part of are related gardening and diy so I highly doubt they'll see this, if so by the time they do, I'll hopefully be gone. I talked to my job and explained things to my manager. And they promised to look into openings in other states to see if they could get me into one. They'll have an update on that in three days. I trust that my bank account us secured, considering he's tried to get into it before and failed. I found one camera in the kitchen, another in the living room and one in our bedroom. As such, I've left them in place for now and done all other planning, either in the bathroom pretending I'm taking a bath. 

I'm honestly staying away from the domestic violence services as my sister-in-law is unfortunately higher up in those considering she volunteers there and I have a feeling if I did show up there, they would know in a heartbeat. I can't look for apartments until I get the update from my work, but either or i'm still gonna be leaving the state. The day before I do I will be changing my number carrier and wiping my laptop and all of his electronics before I do. 

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him. 

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job. 

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time. 

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2hLOsd7Kbg)  **Apr 30, 2024** 

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL  to show me his favorite recipes. 

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm. 

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind. 

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in. 

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/AXTZmkIqAB)  **May 7, 2024** 

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left. 

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through. 

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this. 

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.


[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/F2jysvg8bc)  **May 14, 2024** 

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him. 

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex. 

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess. 

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.   

[Update on leaving](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/958o4qYgbB)  **May 26, 2024** 

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change. 

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in. 

The responses I got from the emails varied. His family said I was overreacting, and that I owe Alex an apology for the problems this has caused him. The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild. As much as I want to say I was surprised by the lack of support, I’m honestly not. 

He intends to fight the divorce. I am letting my lawyer handle it, and I am also pursuing a protective order as well. Once I got approved for my apartment, I also froze my credit. I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA. 

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage. 

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water.  

[Another Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/78UYNmEZUt)  **June 25, 2024** 

It’s been a month since my previous update, and I wanted to share some of what’s been going on in the meantime. The divorce is proceeding, but even though I don’t need him to agree – and he’s not – it means I have to go through the courts to get it approved. As such, it could be upwards of six months to push it through even though I’m filing without attempting to claim property, alimony or compensation. I just want a clean break and separation. 

Alex has attempted to use our friends to reach out to me, as he doesn’t want to use my lawyer for communication. He’s saying its disrespectful and cowardly to hide behind my lawyer and not meet him face to face. Alex wrote me a letter that he did pass off to my lawyer, but the contents were him justifying his actions and claiming that in today's time it is dangerous for women to be on their own which is why he was so intent on trying to keep me safe from harm. He wanted me to understand that he was trying to protect me as best he could and was hurt that I would just lie to him and hide my actions from him related to my dissatisfaction with our marriage and my moving. 

I didn’t reply, because at no point did he apologize. All he did was turn everything around on me as I was being overly dramatic, emotional and cowardly. There was a second letter with Alex’s from my SIL. Her letter… was honestly disturbing and completely justified my misgivings regarding approaching her in any kind of professional capacity. She spent five paragraphs detailing how a ‘real abusive’ relationship looked like and that Alex was the furthest thing from abusive. The details she included were all related to financial abuse and physical abuse. Nothing like what Alex had been doing. She stated that my attempts to smear her brother’s name for attention and clout made me the abuser not him. 

I haven’t really been able to process that admittedly. Part of me can’t help but wonder if she’s right. I mean, I blindsided him by leaving as I did and am refusing to speak with him at all. My old boss recommended that I look into getting into therapy after I moved, and I think I need to. I have had a hard time adjusting to being on my own, I keep censoring myself and haven’t even gone out to eat yet. I always end up worrying about what if someone sees me, what if I get in trouble for spending my money on something frivolous… 

My lawyer is continuing to fight for the divorce, and I shouldn’t need to be physically present in court. Any meetings needed between me and the judge can be done via zoom. I’m trying to avoid confrontation with Alex and his family for now as much as I can and passed both letters to my lawyer in case he needs them. Our friends are mostly trying to avoid taking sides still, and I’m honestly approaching the point of just letting them go as well. I’m tired of fighting for them to understand at this point. I don’t know if anything is going to happen, so my next update may not be until around mid-November depending on how long it takes to push the divorce through. Work is going well, and it’s helpful to have something familiar to anchor my day to day life when so much has changed and is changing even now. 

[Divorce Proceeding Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/kYSL43wzq7)  **Oct 17, 2024** 

It’s been a while since I last updated, as I needed to let the court step in as Alex was not willing to grant my request for a divorce. We started with mediated session via zoom, but after four sessions it was decided that no compromise could be reached between us. The things Alex was pushing for were one’s I’m not even willing to humor let alone agree to. He wanted me to tell our friends and those I’d sent the information to about his actions that I’d made it up in order to gain sympathy. He also wanted me to pay him for defamation and suffering, especially the wages he lost because of sitting in jail for two days and missing work before getting bailed out. Lastly, he also wanted me to return and to quote him ‘stop my foolish behavior and act like a proper wife and partner.’ 

Yeah no. 

So, needless to say, our ‘mediated’ sessions went absolutely nowhere. The judge isn’t seeming to buy into Alex’s act thankfully, because he’s certainly tried. It took me far too long to see Alex for who he was, and part of me feels like an idiot because I didn’t see it at all. Yet, the judge seemed to clock him for exactly what he is within the first meeting. Maybe I just didn’t want to see it. I don’t know. Alex ended up arguing with the Judge a LOT, even being held in contempt four different times. I think it's honestly why this moved as quick as it did. It didn't help that Alex tried to pull in his family as character witnesses but they were dismissed by the Judge as the 'abuse wasn't seen or heard by them, and as such, they only knew part of Alex's character.' In his closing statement after he approved the divorce, he went on to call Alex a narcissist and that if Alex loved himself so much to abuse the one he'd married to let the divorce happen and marry a mirror next. I didn't think a Judge was allowed to say that. At all. But my lawyer just shook his head and told me not to say anything so we left. 

So here’s the update I’m sure everyone’s been hoping for and guessed: I’m officially divorced. The documents were processed three days ago, and I’m still in disbelief. I have no contact with Alex any longer, nor do I want any. I’m not going to give our friends my new contact information. I may not have replied to everyone, though I tried, but I did read all of your comments. I really did. Your repeated statements about how they weren’t actually friends really helped me see that they *weren’t*. So, I decided that since I moved far from that place, I needed to start over. New home, new place, new friends. It’s slow, and I’ve started therapy though it took almost three months to get it due to the usual wait times but I’ve been going three times a week ever since. It’s helping, even with things I thought were done and dusted. 

Alex didn’t take the divorce well according to my lawyer who’s been keeping up with him to make sure he stays away from me. He did something at work, I don’t know what as obviously I have no way to gain that information, but whatever it was cost him his job. My lawyer also did something I didn’t expect him to, but something I think everyone will like – He took the letter my ex-sil sent me and forwarded it to the domestic violence organization she works for along with an formal statement regarding Alex, his actions, and the decision of the Judge. She’s been let go as well, and given how tight those organizations are with one another, my lawyer said that the likely hood of her getting a position at another is slim to none. I actually laughed, though I was a bit teary, when he said that and that ‘slim is on a leaky rowboat to China.’ 

I’ve been crying a lot lately, but my therapist says it’s normal and shows I’m actually processing things instead of bottling them up and pushing them down. I’ll try to update in a month or so, if my emotions level out some, to explain a few more of the details but I wanted to get this out there, and thank everyone for their continued support and encouragement. I appreciate each and every one of you. I really do. You gave me the hope that leaving him wasn’t going to be this giant black mark I’d never heal from or move on from. Work is going well, and the sense of normality and routine is helping me avoid feeling like everything has been spiraling out of control. 

##**NEW UPDATE**

[I'm working on me now...](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/wAcOx7vYug)  **Nov 18, 2024**

It's been a month since I finally was able to share the success of my divorce from Alex. My mood swings are still happening, but they don't last quite as long anymore so I'm taking that as a good sign. My therapist recommended that I sign up for some kind of physical activity, just to help work out and channel what she called the fight/flight instincts more. So I've joined a local self-defense club and I'm going twice a week. I felt really awkward in the beginning, but they've all been super nice and welcoming so it's been easier. It has helped I think, a lot of my jitteriness and anxiety has calmed and I'm sleeping better as well. 

I've also joined a book club, though it's all online at the moment, they're discussing the possibility of meeting in person rather than over skype at a local park. It's hard, honestly. I feel like a kid that just changed schools and sometimes feel like it's either sink or swim. My therapist pointed out that if I feel like I'm sinking to stop, take a step back and remind myself that I have all the control over my actions - if I don't like something I don't have to do it. I can feel my emotions but I also need to not let them control and dictate my actions. She also pointed out how I've developed a tendency to try and fix other people's bad moods. She told me that they're adults, and it's not my responsibility to manage anyone else's emotions other than my own.

It's been hard. But... I'm getting there. I think in a year, as a celebration for my divorce, I may go visit my grandmother's grave. Just to talk if nothing else as silly as that may sound. 

I passed on your thanks to my lawyer, who smiled and said - a bit smugly I might add - that he loves giving people who thought they were untouchable the karma they deserved. He went on to add that he enjoyed being 'Karma's helping hand'. My lawyer has kept abreast of what's been happening with Alex and his sister both, just to make sure they don't try anything. According to him, my ex-sil threw a fit when she was let go from the DV center, enough that she was barred from the premises. It seems that she shares some traits with her brother in regards to temper. She's now working at Lowes apparently, as while she was a volunteer at the DV center, she has to pay some fines for damages she caused during the incident that got her banned.

As for Alex, he's been quiet which worried me at first. But my lawyer told me he's keeping his head down. He's gotten another job with a construction crew, but with everything he has to pay, he cannot afford to lose his job. I was awarded damages for emotional distress and harm, as he never touched me physically. I was able to prove my statements thanks to records of the text conversations between Alex and I regarding the tracker and not leaving the house without permission. As my financial situation is stable, I don't need Alimony, so my Lawyer advised not to try for it and focus on compensation for damages in stead. Alex's family apparently hates me now, as they've reached out to my lawyer, telling him to pass on the message that I've successfully ruined both Alex and his sister's lives over my 'lies'. Honestly, at this point... I'm getting to the point of not caring anymore. I only have so much to give right now for emotional needs and I want it for my own, not to expend on someone else if that makes any kind of sense. 

So that's where I'm at right now. It's hard, coming up to the holidays and being alone but a few weeks ago, I found a kitten in the alley next to my work. He's a tiny, raggedy little thing. He's black, long hair with three white paws and he's also missing his tail. He's got the first vertebrae but nothing else. According to the vet, mom may have accidently bitten it off at birth... which I didn't even know happened but apparently it does. I'm calling him Bandit. So I'm not alone anymore, but now I have a kitten that thinks EVERYTHING needs to be hunted... including my toes to I wear slippers constantly cause those little claws of his are like freaking daggers I swear. I'll update again if anyone wants me to, but yeah... that's where things are now.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/wsEOHLyVYK)  **Apr 27, 2024** 

Throwaway account as my husband and In-laws are follow my main. I, 29 F, have been married to my husband, 30 m, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I met in college during our freshman year. We started off as just friends, and got married seven months ago. I've gotten along with his family, but we aren't super close but we're friendly enough. The problem is that Alex has begun to make me incredibly uncomfortable. 

Firstly, he's begun to ask me who I'm meeting with, where, what we plan on doing, how long every single time I leave the house without him. At first, I just thought he was being protective and a good partner just in case something happened, but then he started checking my phone after the visits, vetting and researching each of my friends as well. 

He also has been pursuing me to link my bank account to his, as he's ""in charge"" of the finances when he was perfectly fine with keeping them separate before. We fight about it almost every day. 

Finally, yesterday when he was preparing to go on a work trip for two weeks in California, he demanded I wear a tracker so he could keep and eye on me while he's gone. I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm suffocating and his family who I've spoken to about his worrying behavior just said he's being careful and protective as a good husband should. I need to gather my things together and find a way to be gone before he gets home without tipping him off. 

He's always threatened that if he ever found me cheating on him he'd turn in divorce papers the same day. He keeps a filled out copy in his desk. I'm going to submit those the day I leave. But there's so much to do, bergen finding a new place to live, seeing if my job has any transfers available, packing and moving in two weeks. His return flight  May 11th, so I need to move quickly. I'm posting here because I don't have any close family, and I can't risk dragging my friends into this as we share the same friends.I just needed a place to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice on the easiest and safest way to do this? 

Edit: oh my god you guys are amazing! I never even thought to not use his divorce papers. I'll check for cameras before I start any packing or prepping. I may also shred his divorce papers just in case and look into getting a lawyer for myself. I'm in a no fault divorce state, that much I so remember which will help. I'll update again when I know more. The tracker he wants me to use is a small clip to put on the belt or waistband. I'll wear it unless I'm going or doing something related to me leaving. No pets yet thankfully.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/v6qRzYi8XD)  **Apr 28, 2024** 

So I've gotten a lot of support and helpful advice along with questions I thought I should clarify before I proceed with the update. Some asked why I'd be 'hiding' things from Alex regarding going out and who I'm meeting with. I don't, and I have nothing to hide. However when he begins to then double check everything I tell him with the other people there right down to each person I talked to and what I said. Did I send any text msgs, did I order food, how much did I eat, that's when it started to feel like I was slowly being pushed into a corner. It didn't start that bad, but gradually grew worse overtime. 

All of the Reddit subs my in-law's families are part of are related gardening and diy so I highly doubt they'll see this, if so by the time they do, I'll hopefully be gone. I talked to my job and explained things to my manager. And they promised to look into openings in other states to see if they could get me into one. They'll have an update on that in three days. I trust that my bank account us secured, considering he's tried to get into it before and failed. I found one camera in the kitchen, another in the living room and one in our bedroom. As such, I've left them in place for now and done all other planning, either in the bathroom pretending I'm taking a bath. 

I'm honestly staying away from the domestic violence services as my sister-in-law is unfortunately higher up in those considering she volunteers there and I have a feeling if I did show up there, they would know in a heartbeat. I can't look for apartments until I get the update from my work, but either or i'm still gonna be leaving the state. The day before I do I will be changing my number carrier and wiping my laptop and all of his electronics before I do. 

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him. 

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job. 

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time. 

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2hLOsd7Kbg)  **Apr 30, 2024** 

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL  to show me his favorite recipes. 

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm. 

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind. 

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in. 

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/AXTZmkIqAB)  **May 7, 2024** 

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left. 

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through. 

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this. 

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.


[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/F2jysvg8bc)  **May 14, 2024** 

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him. 

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex. 

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess. 

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.   

[Update on leaving](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/958o4qYgbB)  **May 26, 2024** 

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change. 

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in. 

The responses I got from the emails varied. His family said I was overreacting, and that I owe Alex an apology for the problems this has caused him. The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild. As much as I want to say I was surprised by the lack of support, I’m honestly not. 

He intends to fight the divorce. I am letting my lawyer handle it, and I am also pursuing a protective order as well. Once I got approved for my apartment, I also froze my credit. I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA. 

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage. 

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water.  

[Another Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/78UYNmEZUt)  **June 25, 2024** 

It’s been a month since my previous update, and I wanted to share some of what’s been going on in the meantime. The divorce is proceeding, but even though I don’t need him to agree – and he’s not – it means I have to go through the courts to get it approved. As such, it could be upwards of six months to push it through even though I’m filing without attempting to claim property, alimony or compensation. I just want a clean break and separation. 

Alex has attempted to use our friends to reach out to me, as he doesn’t want to use my lawyer for communication. He’s saying its disrespectful and cowardly to hide behind my lawyer and not meet him face to face. Alex wrote me a letter that he did pass off to my lawyer, but the contents were him justifying his actions and claiming that in today's time it is dangerous for women to be on their own which is why he was so intent on trying to keep me safe from harm. He wanted me to understand that he was trying to protect me as best he could and was hurt that I would just lie to him and hide my actions from him related to my dissatisfaction with our marriage and my moving. 

I didn’t reply, because at no point did he apologize. All he did was turn everything around on me as I was being overly dramatic, emotional and cowardly. There was a second letter with Alex’s from my SIL. Her letter… was honestly disturbing and completely justified my misgivings regarding approaching her in any kind of professional capacity. She spent five paragraphs detailing how a ‘real abusive’ relationship looked like and that Alex was the furthest thing from abusive. The details she included were all related to financial abuse and physical abuse. Nothing like what Alex had been doing. She stated that my attempts to smear her brother’s name for attention and clout made me the abuser not him. 

I haven’t really been able to process that admittedly. Part of me can’t help but wonder if she’s right. I mean, I blindsided him by leaving as I did and am refusing to speak with him at all. My old boss recommended that I look into getting into therapy after I moved, and I think I need to. I have had a hard time adjusting to being on my own, I keep censoring myself and haven’t even gone out to eat yet. I always end up worrying about what if someone sees me, what if I get in trouble for spending my money on something frivolous… 

My lawyer is continuing to fight for the divorce, and I shouldn’t need to be physically present in court. Any meetings needed between me and the judge can be done via zoom. I’m trying to avoid confrontation with Alex and his family for now as much as I can and passed both letters to my lawyer in case he needs them. Our friends are mostly trying to avoid taking sides still, and I’m honestly approaching the point of just letting them go as well. I’m tired of fighting for them to understand at this point. I don’t know if anything is going to happen, so my next update may not be until around mid-November depending on how long it takes to push the divorce through. Work is going well, and it’s helpful to have something familiar to anchor my day to day life when so much has changed and is changing even now. 

[Divorce Proceeding Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/kYSL43wzq7)  **Oct 17, 2024** 

It’s been a while since I last updated, as I needed to let the court step in as Alex was not willing to grant my request for a divorce. We started with mediated session via zoom, but after four sessions it was decided that no compromise could be reached between us. The things Alex was pushing for were one’s I’m not even willing to humor let alone agree to. He wanted me to tell our friends and those I’d sent the information to about his actions that I’d made it up in order to gain sympathy. He also wanted me to pay him for defamation and suffering, especially the wages he lost because of sitting in jail for two days and missing work before getting bailed out. Lastly, he also wanted me to return and to quote him ‘stop my foolish behavior and act like a proper wife and partner.’ 

Yeah no. 

So, needless to say, our ‘mediated’ sessions went absolutely nowhere. The judge isn’t seeming to buy into Alex’s act thankfully, because he’s certainly tried. It took me far too long to see Alex for who he was, and part of me feels like an idiot because I didn’t see it at all. Yet, the judge seemed to clock him for exactly what he is within the first meeting. Maybe I just didn’t want to see it. I don’t know. Alex ended up arguing with the Judge a LOT, even being held in contempt four different times. I think it's honestly why this moved as quick as it did. It didn't help that Alex tried to pull in his family as character witnesses but they were dismissed by the Judge as the 'abuse wasn't seen or heard by them, and as such, they only knew part of Alex's character.' In his closing statement after he approved the divorce, he went on to call Alex a narcissist and that if Alex loved himself so much to abuse the one he'd married to let the divorce happen and marry a mirror next. I didn't think a Judge was allowed to say that. At all. But my lawyer just shook his head and told me not to say anything so we left. 

So here’s the update I’m sure everyone’s been hoping for and guessed: I’m officially divorced. The documents were processed three days ago, and I’m still in disbelief. I have no contact with Alex any longer, nor do I want any. I’m not going to give our friends my new contact information. I may not have replied to everyone, though I tried, but I did read all of your comments. I really did. Your repeated statements about how they weren’t actually friends really helped me see that they *weren’t*. So, I decided that since I moved far from that place, I needed to start over. New home, new place, new friends. It’s slow, and I’ve started therapy though it took almost three months to get it due to the usual wait times but I’ve been going three times a week ever since. It’s helping, even with things I thought were done and dusted. 

Alex didn’t take the divorce well according to my lawyer who’s been keeping up with him to make sure he stays away from me. He did something at work, I don’t know what as obviously I have no way to gain that information, but whatever it was cost him his job. My lawyer also did something I didn’t expect him to, but something I think everyone will like – He took the letter my ex-sil sent me and forwarded it to the domestic violence organization she works for along with an formal statement regarding Alex, his actions, and the decision of the Judge. She’s been let go as well, and given how tight those organizations are with one another, my lawyer said that the likely hood of her getting a position at another is slim to none. I actually laughed, though I was a bit teary, when he said that and that ‘slim is on a leaky rowboat to China.’ 

I’ve been crying a lot lately, but my therapist says it’s normal and shows I’m actually processing things instead of bottling them up and pushing them down. I’ll try to update in a month or so, if my emotions level out some, to explain a few more of the details but I wanted to get this out there, and thank everyone for their continued support and encouragement. I appreciate each and every one of you. I really do. You gave me the hope that leaving him wasn’t going to be this giant black mark I’d never heal from or move on from. Work is going well, and the sense of normality and routine is helping me avoid feeling like everything has been spiraling out of control. 

##**NEW UPDATE**

[I'm working on me now...](https://www.reddit.com/u/Complex-Wing7114/s/wAcOx7vYug)  **Nov 18, 2024**

It's been a month since I finally was able to share the success of my divorce from Alex. My mood swings are still happening, but they don't last quite as long anymore so I'm taking that as a good sign. My therapist recommended that I sign up for some kind of physical activity, just to help work out and channel what she called the fight/flight instincts more. So I've joined a local self-defense club and I'm going twice a week. I felt really awkward in the beginning, but they've all been super nice and welcoming so it's been easier. It has helped I think, a lot of my jitteriness and anxiety has calmed and I'm sleeping better as well. 

I've also joined a book club, though it's all online at the moment, they're discussing the possibility of meeting in person rather than over skype at a local park. It's hard, honestly. I feel like a kid that just changed schools and sometimes feel like it's either sink or swim. My therapist pointed out that if I feel like I'm sinking to stop, take a step back and remind myself that I have all the control over my actions - if I don't like something I don't have to do it. I can feel my emotions but I also need to not let them control and dictate my actions. She also pointed out how I've developed a tendency to try and fix other people's bad moods. She told me that they're adults, and it's not my responsibility to manage anyone else's emotions other than my own.

It's been hard. But... I'm getting there. I think in a year, as a celebration for my divorce, I may go visit my grandmother's grave. Just to talk if nothing else as silly as that may sound. 

I passed on your thanks to my lawyer, who smiled and said - a bit smugly I might add - that he loves giving people who thought they were untouchable the karma they deserved. He went on to add that he enjoyed being 'Karma's helping hand'. My lawyer has kept abreast of what's been happening with Alex and his sister both, just to make sure they don't try anything. According to him, my ex-sil threw a fit when she was let go from the DV center, enough that she was barred from the premises. It seems that she shares some traits with her brother in regards to temper. She's now working at Lowes apparently, as while she was a volunteer at the DV center, she has to pay some fines for damages she caused during the incident that got her banned.

As for Alex, he's been quiet which worried me at first. But my lawyer told me he's keeping his head down. He's gotten another job with a construction crew, but with everything he has to pay, he cannot afford to lose his job. I was awarded damages for emotional distress and harm, as he never touched me physically. I was able to prove my statements thanks to records of the text conversations between Alex and I regarding the tracker and not leaving the house without permission. As my financial situation is stable, I don't need Alimony, so my Lawyer advised not to try for it and focus on compensation for damages in stead. Alex's family apparently hates me now, as they've reached out to my lawyer, telling him to pass on the message that I've successfully ruined both Alex and his sister's lives over my 'lies'. Honestly, at this point... I'm getting to the point of not caring anymore. I only have so much to give right now for emotional needs and I want it for my own, not to expend on someone else if that makes any kind of sense. 

So that's where I'm at right now. It's hard, coming up to the holidays and being alone but a few weeks ago, I found a kitten in the alley next to my work. He's a tiny, raggedy little thing. He's black, long hair with three white paws and he's also missing his tail. He's got the first vertebrae but nothing else. According to the vet, mom may have accidently bitten it off at birth... which I didn't even know happened but apparently it does. I'm calling him Bandit. So I'm not alone anymore, but now I have a kitten that thinks EVERYTHING needs to be hunted... including my toes to I wear slippers constantly cause those little claws of his are like freaking daggers I swear. I'll update again if anyone wants me to, but yeah... that's where things are now.

Na-Scam ka na ba ng VUL? Here's what they're not telling you,"A few years ago, isang financial advisor (na tropa ko pa!) ang nag-alok ng VUL. ""Perfect to bro"" sabi niya, ""may life insurance ka na, may investment ka pa!"" Syempre, sino ba naman ang hindi ma-hype? Dalawang kailangan sa buhay - insurance at investment - sa isang hulog lang? Ang galing ng offer.

Nag-start ako maghulog ng P3,000/month. After a few years, naisip ko i-check kung magkano na ang “investment” value ko.

Akala ko naman medyo malaki na kasi ang total na hinulog ko was over P100,000. Pero eto ang masakit: ang naiwan sa investment ko?

LESS THAN HALF.

Paano nangyari yun? More details on that, later.

Kwento ng kaibigan ko naman:

She's a mom of two na naghulog ng P5,000/month for five years. Dapat daw, magagamit na niya yung investment for her kids' college fund. Pero nung nagtanong siya kung magkano na ang fund value niya, halos himatayin siya: less than P80,000! Eh P300,000 na yung hinulog niya. Nagka-trust issues siya after nun, hindi lang sa VUL kundi pati sa mga ""financial advisors"".

Saan napunta ang pera ko?


Here’s the truth about VUL na hindi sinasabi sayo upfront:

1. Malaki ang commission ng financial advisor


Yes, besh. Yung kausap mo, usually gets 40-50% of your first-year premium as commission. So kung naghulog ka ng P3,000/month, halos P18,000 sa first year napunta sa kanila. At hindi lang siya! Yung managers nila? May cut din. Kaya bago pa umabot sa investment, ubos na.


2. Ang daming charges:


Insurance charges: Habang tumatanda ka, mas lumalaki ang portion ng premium mo na napupunta sa insurance fee.

Admin fees: May fees pa for maintaining your account.

Investment charges: Kapag yung natira mong pera, pinasok sa funds, may fees din dito na kinakain ang returns. Kaya kahit kumita ang market, parang wala kang napapala.


3. Kapag tumigil ka sa hulog, goodbye pera mo.


Hindi totoo yung ""investment"" na iniisip mo. Sa VUL, may minimum na taon na dapat kang maghulog (lock-in period). Kung tumigil ka bago mo ito matapos, forfeited ang pera mo. Yes, kahit ilang taon mo na itong binayaran.


4. Walang guarantee kapag nalugi ang fund.


Ang investments sa VUL nakadepende sa market. Kapag bumagsak ang fund na pinili mo, lugi ka. At kung sakaling magka-issue ang company, hindi rin nila guaranteed na mababayaran ka—hindi sila obligated na i-cover ang nawala mong ""investment.""

----

Ang VUL ay parang toxic na relationship: ikaw ang bigay nang bigay, pero wala kang nakukuhang balik. At yung financial advisor mo? Kumita na sayo upfront. Kahit magka-loss ka sa dulo, sila safe na. Kaya nga tuwing sinasabi ko ito sa mga finance-related Facebook groups, ang daming nagagalit. Bakit? Dahil ito yung kabuhayan nila. Pero, eto ang tanong: bakit natin tinotolerate ang ganitong predatory practices?

Let’s stop normalizing these predatory practices. Marami pang mas maayos na investment like term insurance, uitfs and etfs na mas mura and barely any fees.

Kung may VUL ka na, reevaluate mo. And if you're planning to get one, pause muna. Aralin mo mabuti. Sa dulo, pera mo yan. You deserve to keep it. Wag mo nang ipaubaya sa VUL.

UPDATE 1: ang daming Financial Advisors na galit sakin kasi daw mawawalan sila ng kita dahil sa post na to. Pero honestly, happy ako na maraming nagse-share ng experiences nila sa predatory VULs. Tuloy niyo lang! The more stories we share, the more people we help.

UPDATE 2: Ang dami laging nagsasabi na ‘basahin kasi yung kontrata.’ Tapos parang kasalanan pa ng customer na hindi nila naintindihan. Eh diba nga, konti lang naman talaga ang nagbabasa ng kontrata? Aminin mo, binasa mo ba terms and conditions ng Gmail, Reddit, or Facebook bago ka sumali?

Alam din naman natin na hindi ganun kalakas ang reading comprehension ng karamihan sa atin. Kaya kung ang daming nagrereklamo na na-budol sila dahil sa false advertising ng FA, edi ibig sabihin may mali sa sistema. Dapat siguro gumawa ng mas klarong rules yung IC or government para lahat ng kukuha, fully aware kung ano ba talaga pinapasok nila.

Ang masaklap pa, ito din kadalasan ang ginagamit na dahilan ng mga nagtatrabaho sa insurance para i-justify yung mga naloko—‘Kasalanan mo yan, hindi ka nagbasa.’ Pero sa totoo lang, may responsibilidad din ang FA at insurance company na gawing simple at transparent ang mga terms.

UPDATE 3: What Should Happen (kung magstrictly regulate ang Insurance Commission):

FA: Hello, ma’am/sir! Alok ko lang po sainyo itong VUL offer namin. It’s an insurance product combined with an investment. Pero gusto ko lang i-clear na hindi guaranteed ang returns.

For example, kung mag-invest po kayo ng P400k, P270k na lang ang mapupunta sa actual investment kasi yung balance po ay napupunta sa fees and commissions. Nandito po lahat ng details sa dokumentong ito—please take the time to read it before signing.

Gusto ko rin pong sabihin na kung mag-withdraw kayo early, may penalties, at baka hindi niyo makuha yung full amount ng hinulog ninyo.

Kung ang goal niyo po ay protection lang, we also offer term insurance or life insurance. Mas mura siya at straightforward, so it might suit your needs better.

Let me know po kung ano ang mas swak sa goals nyo!

What Actually Happens:

FA: Hello, ma’am/sir! May investment opportunity ako for you na siguradong lalaki ang pera niyo. Bonus pa, may insurance coverage pa! Protected na kayo, tapos malaki pa kikitain niyo pag nag-retire. Eto na po ang kontrata - sign na dito!

See the difference? Sa tamang presentation, transparent lahat ng details at options, kaya mas informed yung client. Pero kadalasan, parang hard sell na agad without fully explaining the risks and charges. Kaya ang daming naloloko.

UPDATE 4: It’s crazy how people keep saying it’s just the FA’s fault, as if the insurance provider has nothing to do with it. Eh sino ba nag-hire at nag-train sa mga FA? Obviously, the insurance company. If there’s deception, they’re the ones who taught it. Ang dami nang reklamo, pero walang accountability.

And most of the time, the FA is a friend or relative, kaya kahit naloko ka, you won’t complain - friendship over or tahimik ka na lang sa family reunion.

Tapos people blame the clients for not doing research? Eh FA nga ang pinaniwalaan kasi ‘advisor’ daw sila. And then they say pinoys just want a get-rich scheme? Pero sino ba nagsasabi na ‘investment’ ang VUL? Hindi ba yun FA? Try dropping by a bank and inquiring about VULs - let’s see if the pitch is more focused on insurance or investment. Puro budol.

At the end of the day, pare-pareho lang ang VUL product, regardless kung sino ang FA - same commission, same predatory shitty fees.

The VUL product IS the problem. Yung mga FAs gustong gusto ilihis ang issue.

Grabe, after ko i-post ito, sobrang dami pala talagang nabiktima ng VUL. May isang tao pa na inuto na time deposit daw, yun pala VUL. Tapos nung nasa ospital yung magulang niya at kailangan na yung pera, hindi nila makuha. Ang sakit at sobrang nakakagalit isipin.

Masakit makita na pinaghirapan mo, hindi mo man lang magamit nung panahon na kailangan na kailangan mo.

UPDATE 5: From insurance employee insiders:

""I worked in an insurance company na may VUL. Totoo to. At most agents don't disclose these infos. Maraming nag cacancel agad ng policy once makita ung first statement. Sadly ung iba after cool off period na nacacancel so may loss na talaga.

Ang hanap ko nalang na insurance ngayon ay yung pure insurance lang. Kahit pay until specific age.

Just invest the rest of your money somewhere else.""

u/SnooPoems2582

""I work in an insurance company. Hindi sa insurance related department pero kasama sa requirements namin is to understand Life and Non-Life Insurance.

Computation is based also on age and yung risk. So tama na tumataas yan, and once nadiagnose ka ng critical illness, you can get your claim and hindi ka na insurable.

Agree ako kay OP, and natutunan ko yan when I entered the insurance industry. Critical na dapat naiintindihan ng clients yung mga nasabi dito, because all of it are true.

Below are some of the things I learned while working with underwriters / claims analyst:

Ang VUL should be sold sa value proposition na ipuput-first ang insurance, at hindi investment.

Remember that insurance is an expense at hindi investment. You are paying for your peace of mind by passing the risk sa insurance agency for a certain fee. Investment grows overtime, insurance becomes more expensive as time goes by.

Claims undergo evaluation ng claims analyst. Look at your contract na napakahaba, kasi nakasulat doon kaylan ka lang makakaclaim at ano anong bagay yung pwedeng magcause ng claim denial. This must be discussed IN DETAIL ng FA mo. Kapag hindi makasagot FA mo, hanap ka iba. Kasi ang magagaling na FA helps ensure maayos ang claims requirements mo para pumasa ka sa claims evaluation. They also help you manage expectation through clarifying everything from the start.

A good insurance company is measured sa claims ratio nya, which is gaano kadaming claims request ang nagagrant vs sa total claims request received. Ask your FA about this. Minsan kasi masisilaw ka dyan eh, may nakaclaim na 3m, pero ang tanong dapat is ilan ang nagfile ng claims na nagrant compared sa total. Makikita mo at maliit lang yan.

Lastly, mahalaga na insured ka, whether ano mang product yan, pero mas mahalaga na nainsure ka sa tamang product. Look at the list of critical illness covered, look at paano ang claims process, etc.

Shawtawt kay OP for this educational post at sa mga responsableng FA.

sa mga indenial, nako mag isip isip kayo kasi hindi araw araw you will encounter such post.""

UPDATE 6:

FYI: VULs come in many names, so double-check before committing.

Don’t be fooled by the creative branding. Always read the fine print and ask if it’s a VUL - huwag magpadala sa magandang pangalan lang!

A female passenger's bag containing a power bank and headphones suddenly caught fire and exploded.,,219,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j689gg,1741404862.0,singaporehappenings,A female passenger's bag containing a power bank and headphones suddenly caught fire and exploded. 
Boomer parents sell house and spend all of the money before buying a new one. ,"Back in 2016 my wife and I decided to buy vacant land about 3 hours from where we lived. The jobs were better there for both of us and we were sick and tired of our hometown.  We were going to save for a few more years and build our forever home. We are only children with the only grandchild and the grandparents were very active in our lives and our child’s life. We offered them to go in with us on land and they could build a house too. My parents agreed. In laws said no because, “I just can’t think that far ahead.”  We bought five acres with my parents. 

Fast forward to 2020. We start building and move into a rental nearby. My in laws FREAK OUT. MIL starts crying that we can’t take away their grandchild.  They say it’s unfair to move somewhere they can’t afford to move to. We remind them it’s only a three hour drive away and that we gave them the chance to go in with us to make it affordable. (Because they didn’t go in with us we didn’t buy land zoned for three families). 

A few weeks after we move, the in laws call us. They have a plan. They are going to sell their place which is completely paid off and buy a small plot of land an hour away from us in the mountains and put a manufactured home on it. This was going to be affordable because my FIL is a retired civil engineer and insisted he could be his own General contractor. 

Now. We had just built a house. We knew what a pain in the ass it is and how unexpectedly expensive it is. Both the in laws were retired and we had recently found out that they had almost no savings (despite making low six figures in a LCOL area for the last 25 years) and were living off of social security. We told them that they should keep their house that is paid off and just drive because this was going to be A LOT more expensive than they were planning. 

FIL showed me his budget and it looked like it was based on building costs from the 90’s. For example, our well and pump cost $25k. He had budgeted $5,000. When I pointed out his estimates were WAY too low he got mad and said I overpaid. 

My FIL is extremely old fashioned and from rural Missouri. He still goes to the store or mechanic and tries to barter for services. True to form, my FIL found someone to buy their house for 75% of market value cash plus services. The guy was a contractor that put up fences around dairies. I honestly have no idea how my FIL thought this guy would help but FIL insisted the man was very handy. 

That left them with $300,000 for this project. (This is California, so that’s not a lot.) They bought the mobile home for $150,000. That included a $20,000 discount because my FIL insisted he could set the home on the foundation and finish it (install carpets and doors and other things the company usually does) for less than that.  

By my math, they actually had just barely enough for electric, trenching, septic, water, foundation, finishing, grading, and permits and fees.  My FIL got bids for everything which all looked reasonable to me but he insisted that they were way too high so he was going to wait for the market to come down. He did take the bid for the foundation though and got that poured. In the meantime he bought a fifth wheel to live on the property and my MIL moved in with a neighbor and lived in their fifth wheel. 

FIL then went on what I can best describe as a spending bender. Anything he thought was a good deal that he could turn around and sell for more he bought. I showed up at his fifth wheel and there was just tons of shit there. Here is an incomplete list of things he bought:

- a used Cadillac SUV ( he already had two cars)
- hay storage that goes on the back of his horse trailer
- 3 stoves that were open box from Lowes
- Slightly damaged cabinets from Lowe’s 
- 300 feet of steel pipe (for fencing?)
- 6 gas powered generators
- A used saddle
- Tons of parts for his truck

The generators were because he refused to pay PGE the hook up fees because they would report him to the county and make him pay permit and school fees he was trying to avoid. So his idea was that he would constantly run generators for power. When we pointed out they were loud, he had neighbors, and he couldn’t run them over night for things like his fridge, he said, “I’ll just push the fridge outside every night. It’s pretty cold here.”

After the mobile home arrived, he realized he needed to clear trees. He didn’t want to pay a licensed contractor so he paid someone he met at the hardware store to do it. They dropped a massive tree on the foundation which shattered it. For reasons I still do not understand, he put the mobile home up on blocks over the foundation before fixing it. He was now afraid to remove anymore trees so there is a giant tree three feet in front of their front door and the door cannot open all the way. 

Meanwhile, my MIL also went on a shopping bender and bought all new furniture while doing nothing to help with the actual project.  All she did was complain about what FIL was doing and how long it was taking. 

Fast forward 2 years later. My MIL has had to move in with her sister and wants a divorce. My MIL asks me for help finishing the project so she can sell it and get her share. I meet with my FIL and tell him I’m gonna get some contractors up here to finish the job. I was informed they still had $90k in the building fund. I called all my contractors and I got bids and we could just barely get everything paid for except permits and fees for that amount because my friends were cutting me a deal (they built my house and I gave them several referrals). So I ask to see the money before my friends start the project and guess what, they only have $5k left. Five. From $150,000. I asked where the money went and FIL said he spent it on the construction project. He said he bought the special sand you need for electrical trenching (for example) then showed me the “special sand”. It was run of the mill DG. Someone fleeced him and he paid 6k for a couple cubic yards of it.  The steel pipe he said was for a horse fence. He said he met a woman at the grocery store who wanted to board her horse somewhere and agreed to do it with him. His zoning does not allow horses. 

I asked my MIL for the bank statements on the building account for the last couple of years. I start going through it and he was using it like a debit card. Paid for his car insurance, trips to the liquor store (he was drinking ungodly amounts of alcohol), even just buying donuts. He had spent it all. My MIL was furious. I said, “you had access to this the whole time, you could have checked what he was doing!”  

I called my FIL and chewed him out for spending all the money on useless shit and wasting my contractor’s time. I said you spent the money for your home and now neither of you have anywhere to live.  I was furious because this is a man that I care about and now he is effectively homeless and my MIL was now living in a one bedroom apartment with her sister and nephew. He got mad, said none of that was true and stopped talking to us. He sent an email to everyone else in the family telling them that I am a huge asshole among other things. He even reached out to my wife expecting her to take his side (she did not).  

He is now estranged to us. He still lives in the fifth wheel on the lot without electricity and every November when it gets cold he calls/texts/emails us saying that he is ready to finish the house now but he needs to borrow money.  I had to go up there to get some of my MILs stuff and it looks like a drug den. Bottles and cans everywhere. Garbage everywhere. Tons of weather  damage to the mobile home because it’s not sealed and finished. Piles of junk everywhere (steel pipe and DG!). The Cadillac is up on blocks because he wrecked it and he is trying to fix it himself. Oh and the carpet and cabinets and doors and everything were still not installed and rotting in weather (he’s above snow line). 

MIL still lives with her sister and has no plan for when her sister (who is much older and sick) dies. She occasionally hints at moving in with us but that’s a non starter for a million reasons. 

Oh and my parents ended up getting divorced over the move up here too but that’s another dumb story.   ",5475,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1fnmf16/boomer_parents_sell_house_and_spend_all_of_the/,1727103333.0,BoomersBeingFools,"Boomer parents sell house and spend all of the money before buying a new one.  Back in 2016 my wife and I decided to buy vacant land about 3 hours from where we lived. The jobs were better there for both of us and we were sick and tired of our hometown.  We were going to save for a few more years and build our forever home. We are only children with the only grandchild and the grandparents were very active in our lives and our child’s life. We offered them to go in with us on land and they could build a house too. My parents agreed. In laws said no because, “I just can’t think that far ahead.”  We bought five acres with my parents. 

Fast forward to 2020. We start building and move into a rental nearby. My in laws FREAK OUT. MIL starts crying that we can’t take away their grandchild.  They say it’s unfair to move somewhere they can’t afford to move to. We remind them it’s only a three hour drive away and that we gave them the chance to go in with us to make it affordable. (Because they didn’t go in with us we didn’t buy land zoned for three families). 

A few weeks after we move, the in laws call us. They have a plan. They are going to sell their place which is completely paid off and buy a small plot of land an hour away from us in the mountains and put a manufactured home on it. This was going to be affordable because my FIL is a retired civil engineer and insisted he could be his own General contractor. 

Now. We had just built a house. We knew what a pain in the ass it is and how unexpectedly expensive it is. Both the in laws were retired and we had recently found out that they had almost no savings (despite making low six figures in a LCOL area for the last 25 years) and were living off of social security. We told them that they should keep their house that is paid off and just drive because this was going to be A LOT more expensive than they were planning. 

FIL showed me his budget and it looked like it was based on building costs from the 90’s. For example, our well and pump cost $25k. He had budgeted $5,000. When I pointed out his estimates were WAY too low he got mad and said I overpaid. 

My FIL is extremely old fashioned and from rural Missouri. He still goes to the store or mechanic and tries to barter for services. True to form, my FIL found someone to buy their house for 75% of market value cash plus services. The guy was a contractor that put up fences around dairies. I honestly have no idea how my FIL thought this guy would help but FIL insisted the man was very handy. 

That left them with $300,000 for this project. (This is California, so that’s not a lot.) They bought the mobile home for $150,000. That included a $20,000 discount because my FIL insisted he could set the home on the foundation and finish it (install carpets and doors and other things the company usually does) for less than that.

ASUS wants $3758 to repair a small plastic indent on their $2799 ASUS RTX 4090 WHITE OC [UPDATE],"nvidia sub *took down the post, here is a follow up. Prices are in CAD.*

Purchased brand new ASUS RTX4090 2 weeks ago. Card works perfectly (confirmed by local store) but the safety plastic indent got scratched off. Skeptical of melting stories on 4090 so sent it to ASUS RMA to have it repaired advised by my local store (Canada Computers) and ASUS support. They quote $3758 to have it repaired. Asked for supervisor/manager to make sure the quotation is correct just to repair a small plastic indent.  The supervisor confirmed and said will give me 30% off to have it repaired. I told them that's unacceptable and to escalate this case.

*\[UPDATE\]*

On the same day they send an email with the case escalated. They state the GPU is now not ""functionable"" because of the damage and is not covered under warranty. The GPU needs to be replaced now and wants me to pay over the retail price?!?!  Below is exactly what they said, emails, and photo of the GPU taken from their repair centre.

""*Thank you for reaching out to ASUS Invoice Quotation Support. My name is Amelia M . Thank you for the opportunity to address this matter with you, I have received feedback from the escalation.

It feels like a cruel cruel joke- years before I met my husband I was in such a toxic, abusive relationship that it almost ended my life. I spent years in therapy, bettering myself, figuring out why I accepted that type of “love”

I stayed single for years, and once I started dating, I made sure to keep an eye out on all red flags. Heck, I even took things slowly when there was nothing but green flags. Thanks to my ex I was familiar with love bombing.

I met my husband at work event, and things just fell into place. I opened up and explained my past trauma, and let him know that if we were going to date that it would require a slow pace and patience. I won’t say that he was perfect, but he was always kind, compassionate, and cared.

We dated for about five years, engaged for one and married for a little over three years now. We recently bought our second home together, we both got promotions at work, so we sat down and talked about kids. He wanted a big family, and I only wanted one or two. We agreed on two, and well started trying.

It didn’t take long and here I am six months pregnant, still working, have swollen ankles and a back that won’t stop aching. Other than that I’ve been very happy and have what I thought was a supportive husband.

Three weeks ago, I found out that he was having an emotional affair, and honestly probably a physical one. When confronted with the evidence he admitted to not being attracted to me while pregnant. I’m wrecked. I haven’t gained unnecessary weight, I still take care of myself, even with the morning sickness that hasn’t gone away.

He’s not sorry about it, but you told me that I was being overdramatic when I cried, he is staying with his family until he can find a home to rent, he doesn’t want to get a divorce- he saying after the pregnancy is over we can go to therapy and fix things. I don’t want to.

I cannot physically look this man in the eye anymore without feeling disgust. I have a text from him saying that he’s my only option, because no man wants to date a single mom.

I’ll be talking to a lawyer and figuring out how to divorce him I just wanted to vent into the void today.

For now I’m going to DoorDash some nuggets and a frosty from Wendy’s and be OK if I gain 5 pounds from it thanks for listening well reading I suppose.

*Someone offers to buy OOP food:*

>Thank you for the offer! I already ordered my food and am stuffed.

If you’d like to head over to the free food subreddit and feed someone that’s in need, they need it more then I do ❤️

*In response to a now deleted comment:*

I don’t think you deserved the amount of dislikes for asking a question, maybe it was in the way you worded it. Who really knows.

* Emotional was how I decided to word it, because what else do I call just “talking”
* He was telling a very young naive woman- how hot she was, how he couldn’t wait to touch her body, telling her he loved her, but then claimed they never met. He would complain to her that I wasn’t “fun” anymore. There were obviously pictures sent back and forth due to comments, but the pictures were deleted.
* I asked him about all his “overtime” at work and he couldn’t give straight answers hence the physical aspect of things. This man went from working maybe 40 hours a week to 60 and I may be dealing with pregnancy but I’m not stupid.
* you didn’t ask this but I’m putting it here because people have brought it up and they may read this comment. I would never expect my husband or whatever you want to call him to find my changing body attractive, pregnancy is weird I think it’s beautiful but he or others don’t have to. What I did expect was him to not call me hideous to another woman, or to cheat especially while I’m growing a life we both wanted.

*Why do you have to move?*

>We bought our home together and instead of fighting it out we’ll be selling and splitting assets, or at least I hope that’s how it will be.

>Plus i just don’t want to be here in this house- it’s too big for just a baby and I plus the dog he just had to have that’s currently curled up in bed with me.

*Clarification- have you moved out yet?*

>Oh I’m sorry! I’m still in the shared home- he moved out to stay with his family until he finds another place

**Update (Same Post): February 12, 2024 (2 days later)**

I’m making an edit because I’m not sure this sub will let me do an update post-

I was told I’m not allowed to change the locks due to it being his home as well and he came over last night knowing there wasn’t crap I could do to prevent it. Thankfully he only grabbed some personal belongings, threatened to take the dogs (he did not) and let me know he emptied our shared account. Part of me rolled my eyes and figured he wasn’t dumb enough to do that, and the other part made me make a mental note to check it once he left.

Sure enough our account has maybe $5 in it, he did a transfer which I’ll be calling the bank about and speaking to an attorney this afternoon. Thankfully my dad taught me you don’t fully mix finances so my savings wasn’t capable of being touched- and while it’s not a lot it’s enough to pay for the fees over the next few weeks.

I don’t have any family left so I think he’s doing a power play to make me feel like I’m alone and need him, when in all reality it’s lit a fire under my ass that I don’t want or need such a garbage person in my life.

Thank you to everyone that’s reached out with comments, kind messages and helpful advice.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1arg6r9/a_planned_pregnancy_turned_my_husband_into_a/) **1: February 15, 2024 (3 days later, 5 from OG post)**

I wanted to do an update with how many people took the time to send messages, leave comments and share their own personal stories- which especially helped make me not feel so alone.

As mentioned in an edited post- I was not allowed to change the locks on our house due to both of our names being on it. I never feared for my safety, it was more so an annoyance. He showed up to grab some personal belongings and I thought that what be the most that would happen. It was like he was trying to get a reaction from me- he told me he transferred funds and emptied out the account, I didn’t believe him until I saw it myself. That was both of our money, so that’s being dealt with currently.

He showed up the day before yesterday completely drunk, begging to talk, increasing in anger when I would just ignore him and walk away. It kept increasing so I went to grab my bag and walk down the road to a neighbors home so I wasn’t alone. He grabbed my arm to stop me and when i yanked it away, he slapped me- almost a backhanded open slap.

The cops were called, I didn’t have a mark on my face so it was a my word vs his- they escorted him off the property and I’m only now assuming he’s back with his parents now, he did throw a fit about the dogs and does have proof of ownership so im guessing he’ll be able to take them.

Went to leave to go for a drive to clear my head after everything and realized 3 of my 4 tires were flat, I know it was him but I don’t have proof. Insurance won’t cover it, so going to a tire shop on Friday morning. Just another drop in the bucket

As for the attorney I’ve had my consult and I’m waiting for my check to come in for my actual appointment and getting the ball moving on this.

There’s not any family left, and a few close friends are kept in the loop but I don’t want to burden them or treat them like unpaid therapists so I think that’s why I came back to reddit. Something therapeutic about just typing it all out into the void.

The baby/pregnancy is okay- I’ve actually lost weight, and the doctor has told me to avoid stressful situations and to take things easy.

I’ll be calling to see if I can change the locks on the home now and if not I’m going to start looking for places.

*It's ok to burden one of your friends. Otherwise you could stay in a women's shelter for safety:*

>Staying with friends isn’t possible, a lot are out of state and lawyer mentioned abandonment of assets, plus my job and doctor are here.

I do have someone coming out and putting a few cameras up and thankfully the neighborhood is aware and keeping an eye out.

This is all short term of course and the goal is to leave, there’s just a ton of reasons why that can’t be right this moment

(a different commenter)Unfortunately, all of my friends are out of state and too far away from my work, doctor, and I was recommended to stay on the property so he couldn’t go after me for abandoning the assets

*OOP's best friend:*

>Thank you- while I’m trying to do what I can and stay safe- my friends are on the other side of the us, what we’re doing right now is FaceTimes and phone calls. My best friend has outright said if she calls and I don’t call back within 5 minutes of our setup time she’s calling the police.

She also put in for some time off of work and wants to come up to help me look at places and just be there in general.

I’m not going to lie I’m struggling in every way possible and I’m scared but I know I have a support system to lean on.

*Cameras:*

>My neighbor has some they’re letting me use until I can afford to buy some better ones- they have video but no audio. At this point I’m glad knowing I’ll at least have something.

*I hope you get that money back:*

>I really hope so too, he seriously transferred everything but $5 from the checking and the savings ( which didn’t even have his name on it)

*Wait how?*

>Yeah, we had a shared laptop and I didn’t think he could get into it but I’m somehow thinking he managed with passwords or something. I’ve filed a dispute with the bank and they’re investigating it, along with a fraud report at the police station.

The bank mentioned with it being my husband they may not approve the dispute, so that’s why I went and did a report at the police station.

*Relationship with inlaws/can you start the divorce proceedings sooner than the birth?*

>While I would consider it a civil relationship with the in laws, they are his parents and in their eyes he can do no wrong. He’s an only child and they have a very very close relationship. His mother apologized on his behalf but asked me to put myself in his shoes. They’re choosing to wear blinders to the whole situation.

With the divorce that’s the whole attorney thing- I’ve done a free consultation, the attorney and I agreed with the assets and how things are going it won’t be a mediation(?) and will be a long expensive court battle knowing how spiteful he’s being.

They have recommended a police report on any issue to have it filed, to not block contact with him for proof of harassment and think the best course of action is selling the property and splitting assets.

Id love to just focus on my pregnancy and myself but due to safety reasons I’m staying on top of legal issues

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1auvpoj/pregnancy_turned_husband_into_monster_im_moving/) **2: February 19, 2024 (4 days later, 9 from OG post)**

He broke in late last night, I was able to contact the police before I confronted him but due to location I knew it would be a bit.

I tried walking by him to leave the house but everytime I would he’d shove me, once hard enough to make me stumble and fall backwards.

The eerie part is he never once yelled- threw things-one of the items hit me causing an emergency room visit requiring stitches, said the most vile things- he hated me, I should kill myself, how useless I was etc. yet never once raised his voice, I’m not saying that in a good way- I wish he would have yelled, it was a fight or flight instinct and I found out mine was to freeze. I hate that for myself.

He was arrested and his mother already bailed him out, im staying at a hotel thanks to a work advance and looking into apartments. I won’t be stepping a foot into that home we shared until my best friend is here and even then it will be with police being with us.

Nobody can figure out what made him change almost overnight, only thing I’m guessing is a psychotic break, but I’m not a therapist or doctor.

Besides some ugly bruises and some stitches myself and the baby are fine. My lawyer feels like this is enough to get a protection order for myself and will include the pregnancy/baby.

Next time I see him will be at court, sorry I’m rambling and maybe this doesn’t make any sense.

For now- I’m safe, can sleep good for the first time in weeks. I have the dogs. Nobody is aware of where I am besides one close person, and the police.

Final update- I changed my locks, figured if he’d get the law Involved I’d use pregnancy brain and being forgetful to give him a spare set.

***Relevant Comments:***

*Could it be a head injury?*

>I wish he was hit in the head, fucker deserves it.

On a serious note- no nothing changed, no outside stress, no injuries, nothing that I’m aware of.

I know it sounds unbelievable but once the mask slipped gloves were off. I think he thought he wanted it, to the point where he tried to believe that is what he wanted/the right thing to do.

It’s hard it’s so damn hard, I wish I could hate him but I just feel sorry for him. That does not mean I will ever go back, or at this point talk to him without the law involved. I’m choosing myself and the little one and really it’s his loss.

*Can you get an abortion?*

>I’ve had a couple of those comments so don’t take this reply personally just the one I’m using.

Abortion is not in the books for me- I’m not anti abortion and I feel like it’s a right women should have and it’s heartbreaking what our nation is going through when it comes to women having that striped away.

I’m 6 months pregnant, I can feel her move, I love her, she isn’t a fetus to me she is a baby. If I was 4-8 weeks yeah maybe it would have been an option but it isn’t now

I will take every step in making sure we are protected, I will love her enough for the both of us, I will not let her sperm donor have the opportunity to hurt her.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRA_86739/comments/1b0qnrr/small_personal_update/) **3: February 26, 2024 (1 week later, 16 days from OG post)**

Police met me at my home to grab some personal belongings and pretty much anything and everything else I could grab.

Thanks to the user who recommended me calling the non emergency number it was smooth sailing- he wasn’t home, I didn’t have the fear of him showing up and both officers were very kind.

What I walked into on the other hand was not very fun- this man looked like he went on a bender. Bleach on clothes, food everywhere, personal belongings just destroyed, especially the nursery. I was able to salvage a lot of the bigger items and packed what I could, they’re now in storage until I move into my place.

Took pictures and as aggravating as it was especially with the one step forward two steps back Im hopeful that they’ll just be another thing used against him to prevent custody.

As far as him- he has no way of contacting other then attorney or email and it’s been quiet on both ends, his parents have not reached out I don’t even know what I’d say to them if they tried so no loss there. His girlfriend yes girlfriend as I found out has been trying to contact me via friends to let me know she’s pregnant, I’m unsure if that’s true or not but that in the very least confirms the affair and how well he kept things hidden.

I do want to clear the air I made a post asking for helpful information on resources that could potentially help and someone made a comment saying I was in it for a “ long con” and that’s just untrue- I have not and will not accept any personal items/donations other then advice and maybe an internet hug. (**Editor's note- OOP deleted the post she is referencing. See comment below.)**

While I wish my story was made up, it is not. Maybe it’s a venting board maybe it’s just connecting with people that have been in the same situation but it’s helps keep me sane.

Anyway I’ll leave it at thank you all for listening and checking up on me- I’m safe I’m good, pregnancy is the only thing kicking my ass and I’ll make sure to make a post in a few months letting y’all know she’s here and that we made it. Bye for now ❤️

***OOP's comment on this post:***

Oh trust me I’m having bad days with it especially emotionally, I’m sure the hormones aren’t helping.

I’ve debated if I turned a blind eye and if there really weren’t any red flags.

I’ve had moments where I’ve missed him because it’s not just a switch- we loved each other or at least I loved him. This is a person I planned a future and had a past with.

It’s really just an emotional rollercoaster and that’s okay. I don’t think there’s a right or wrong way to handle all of this but I’m doing my best

***OOP's comment on the post she deleted:***

I’m not asking for money and I’m sorry if it came across that way- I can provide proof and anything else.

I’ve had multiple people reach out and ask if they could help and I’ve always turned it down- the only thing I’m asking is for someone to point me in the way of an organization that I may not know of. If that’s coming across as that way though I can and will delete my post it wasn’t my intention

# *****New Updates*****

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRA_86739/comments/1b7hcqr/you_guys/) **4: March 5, 2024 (1 week later)**

I’ve read every single message and the majority of the comments. Thank you for sharing your experiences, your advice, your love.

More then a few have offered baby items, groceries and gift cards. I cannot in good will accept any of those but if you have items laying around please consider donating them to a charity that helps homeless parents.

One thing that stuck out is someone asked how I could feel sorry for him? I guess I’m an empathic person, to the point where it could be a flaw. I wish if he was so unhappy he would have just told me, we could have fixed it before it became violent and if it wasn’t fixable we could have both been amazing parents.

His girlfriend that reached out wrote an email in which was forwarded to me. She’s saying she’s pregnant and for her sake I hope she’s not. She’s accusing me of ruining a “good” man’s reputation, she called the injuries self inflicted and how they want a paternity test 🙄 My personal favorite was if my baby is actually his she hopes- her baby can grow up with her and have a sister. Little does she know I will go to hell and back to make sure that man does not know anything about my daughter.

As for him, I’ve seen him once while leaving the grocery store. Outside me was calm cool collected, acted like he was a stranger I wouldn’t give a second look at. On the inside I said oh shit about 500 times and cried in the car.

Money situation is fixed (work bonus and promotion) I’ve bought a new and better living room suite and having a painting party at the end of the month. You’re all invited btw.

Still good, still safe, slowly learning to love my new normal.

If you’re in a similar situation or in an abusive relationship man or woman reach out: you’re not alone. You don’t need to be brave, I’m certainly not. You just need that “I can’t do this anymore” to light that fire.

***Relevant Comments:***

Commenter: I’m a petty Betty and would have posted the GFs text about “ruining a good man’s reputation” right next to all the destruction of the house….. let EVERYONE see what a “good man” he is

>**OOP:** You know petty me wanted to show her the texts, the pictures, the well everything.

I’m going to let him show her himself, because until he does I’ll just be that vindictive lying ex.

I was perfect to that man- I poured endless love into our marriage, I spoiled him, I was a best friend, a therapist and probably his biggest hype man and if he can leave that he can leave anything.

There’s no bad issues- I want to see her eat just not at my table type of thing but I’m treating her just like I do him like they’re nothing but a stranger to me.

He doesn’t have to go on the birth certificate and really after the divorce and court dates I don’t think I’ll allow either of them to be a second thought in my head.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1f9vn5y/planned_pregnancy_turned_my_exhusband_into_a/) **5: September 9, 2024 (6 months later, 7 from OG post)**

Hi! It’s been awhile since I’ve posted, I mean last time I posted I had swollen ankles, waddled, thought every little cramp was a contraction and felt like life was falling apart. I want to thank everyone who reached out even months after the fact just to check in on a stranger.

My daughter is here, for privacy im going to leave out her dob but she was 6 pounds two ounces and the most beautiful head of hair I’ve seen (she’s now got the hair style of Danny Devito)

My original posts are still up in case anyway is looking at this with puzzlement. But to say things have been rough would be an understatement. He showed up to the hospital, thankfully everyone was aware and hospital staff handled it properly and perfectly and I was able to focus on labor and delivery. Unfortunately the stress of that alone took an already hectic moment in time and amp’d it up but things could have been so much worse and I’m highly thankful they were not.

Right now I’ve got about 10 different cps calls, they’ve came to my house on 4 occasions. His family and him have filed for an emergency custody hearing and due to leaving the state with my daughter that did give him a foot in the door. It seems the protective order isn’t really helping in that matter. I am still on maternity leave so thankfully my focus has fully been on my daughter, and collecting all the evidence to make sure he doesn’t get any custody other then possibly supervised visits for an hour. My main concern is if he doesn’t get any custody that his parents may do the grandparent route.

I wish it was an update to say I’m kicking motherhoods ass and taking names but most of the time I feel like a burnt out blob- I am in therapy and the doctors are keeping an eye on postpartum depression, yet my doctor thinks a giant hemorrhoid (ex) is the cause instead.

Don’t have an update on the girlfriend of his, have kept the dogs I think they love the little one just as much as I do. Am excited and anxious to see where the next chapter of life will take me.

***Relevant Comments:***

*Don't worry about Grandparents' rights:*

>Thank you for this. The rational side of my brain knows that they have a slim to none chance of getting anywhere, yet the exhausted overstimulated hormones all over the place keep going “what if” so anytime that fear creeps back in I’ll come back to your comment and read it a few times

**OOP** [Posted](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRA_86739/comments/1f9vtmt/baby_is_here/) **on her own page, with some of the same info but also more detail:**

**Title:** Baby is here:

Well honestly she’s been here for a bit but still a newb at life. She was born with a head full of black hair, 6 pounds 2 ounces and was alert from the very start.

I made an update on true of my chest but making a small one here just in case it gets taken down.

Cps has been called numerous times, and came out for a few visits. Everything from I was living in filth, to I was leaving the baby home alone, to that I was addicted to meth has been said and investigated and proved wrong. I did leave the state, and that got his foot in the door for an emergency custody battle which will be coming up soon. The protective order was a joke and has been unhelpful. The man showed up to the hospital while I was in labor but thankfully the hospital staff handled it perfectly. The cops not so much, but didn’t expect it.

I think his parents are the biggest push in the custody thing but I don’t think he’ll get granted more than a few supervised visits. My main concern is if that happens his grandparents going after grandparent rights. To protect their reputation it’s highly likely they will.

Unfortunately I don’t have an update on his girlfriend.

But I did keep the dogs aka the gruesome twosome and I think they love the little one just as much as I do.

Thank you all for still caring and messaging/checking in months later. It means more then I can say

***Relevant Comments:***

Commenter: How did he find out you were in labor so he could show up at the hospital? Do you have a mole feeding him info? 

>**OOP:** I’m assuming so yes, most likely a coworker or at least that is my best guess.

Commenter: \[why they have a claim to emergency custody\] I think they probably tried to file for emergency custody claiming that she was ""kidnapping"" the baby by moving out of state

>**OOP:** Exactly what happened- they said kidnapping/fleeing the state. From what I understand from my lawyer that won’t hold but I am required to do a paternity test since he’s not on her birth certificate.

Why he gets this chance I have no clue. It’s exhausting and I think it’s a control/scare tactic to keep his family happy.

Going to use this comment to just add in two other questions from this post that I can’t find-

Someone mentioned an AirTag. I called a garage explained the situation they’re going to have me drop It off and go over it with a fine tooth comb so if the person that mentioned that is reading this- a big big thank you.

As for the coworkers/someone leaking information I’ve stayed silent ever since.

Finally I cannot get them in trouble with false accusations with cps because they’re making anonymous reports. I know it’s them, my lawyer knows it’s them, heck at this point the caseworker’s probably know it’s them but legally it’s anonymous and they’ll just decline saying/reporting anything.

*Pictures of his destruction:*

>Thank you so so much! I have not kept the pictures personally but my lawyer has them, police documents, the texts, the voicemails. I couldn’t physically keep them in my home because I would look at them over and over again trying to figure out what I missed, where it went wrong, what I could have done to prevent it. It made my mental health spiral.

Neither one of us (lawyer and I) believe that he has a chance when it comes to custody but neither one of us thought he’d get his foot in the door as far as he has either.

Right now it’s focusing on the baby, the dogs, and keeping my physical/mental health in a good place. So thankful for Reddit and everyone that checks in because it’s been therapeutic in a way.

In all reality I need some dad advice. Life has been hectic, crazy, scary, defeating, I’m still going and keeping my head up because I just had a baby and wont let her down.

A kind redditor sent me over here because I’m looking at most importantly the safest but also the easiest way to sell things online. Every place seems to have its downfall- eBay seems like the best, but I’m unsure. Craigslist seems simple fast easy but scammers and the meeting someone online (where’s the best place to meet? Is cash best? Should I take a friend?) makes me question my sanity. A gaming store seems hopeful and the safest but I’ve also heard they’ll give you bottom dollar for anything you can bring in.

This is jumbled and a mess but if you see this and have any kind, helpful so desperately needed dad advice I need it.

It feels like a cruel cruel joke- years before I met my husband I was in such a toxic, abusive relationship that it almost ended my life. I spent years in therapy, bettering myself, figuring out why I accepted that type of “love”

I stayed single for years, and once I started dating, I made sure to keep an eye out on all red flags. Heck, I even took things slowly when there was nothing but green flags. Thanks to my ex I was familiar with love bombing.

I met my husband at work event, and things just fell into place. I opened up and explained my past trauma, and let him know that if we were going to date that it would require a slow pace and patience. I won’t say that he was perfect, but he was always kind, compassionate, and cared.

We dated for about five years, engaged for one and married for a little over three years now. We recently bought our second home together, we both got promotions at work, so we sat down and talked about kids. He wanted a big family, and I only wanted one or two. We agreed on two, and well started trying.

It didn’t take long and here I am six months pregnant, still working, have swollen ankles and a back that won’t stop aching. Other than that I’ve been very happy and have what I thought was a supportive husband.

Three weeks ago, I found out that he was having an emotional affair, and honestly probably a physical one. When confronted with the evidence he admitted to not being attracted to me while pregnant. I’m wrecked. I haven’t gained unnecessary weight, I still take care of myself, even with the morning sickness that hasn’t gone away.

He’s not sorry about it, but you told me that I was being overdramatic when I cried, he is staying with his family until he can find a home to rent, he doesn’t want to get a divorce- he saying after the pregnancy is over we can go to therapy and fix things. I don’t want to.

I cannot physically look this man in the eye anymore without feeling disgust. I have a text from him saying that he’s my only option, because no man wants to date a single mom.

I’ll be talking to a lawyer and figuring out how to divorce him I just wanted to vent into the void today.

For now I’m going to DoorDash some nuggets and a frosty from Wendy’s and be OK if I gain 5 pounds from it thanks for listening well reading I suppose.

*Someone offers to buy OOP food:*

>Thank you for the offer! I already ordered my food and am stuffed.

If you’d like to head over to the free food subreddit and feed someone that’s in need, they need it more then I do ❤️

*In response to a now deleted comment:*

I don’t think you deserved the amount of dislikes for asking a question, maybe it was in the way you worded it. Who really knows.

* Emotional was how I decided to word it, because what else do I call just “talking”
* He was telling a very young naive woman- how hot she was, how he couldn’t wait to touch her body, telling her he loved her, but then claimed they never met. He would complain to her that I wasn’t “fun” anymore. There were obviously pictures sent back and forth due to comments, but the pictures were deleted.
* I asked him about all his “overtime” at work and he couldn’t give straight answers hence the physical aspect of things. This man went from working maybe 40 hours a week to 60 and I may be dealing with pregnancy but I’m not stupid.
* you didn’t ask this but I’m putting it here because people have brought it up and they may read this comment. I would never expect my husband or whatever you want to call him to find my changing body attractive, pregnancy is weird I think it’s beautiful but he or others don’t have to. What I did expect was him to not call me hideous to another woman, or to cheat especially while I’m growing a life we both wanted.

*Why do you have to move?*

>We bought our home together and instead of fighting it out we’ll be selling and splitting assets, or at least I hope that’s how it will be.

>Plus i just don’t want to be here in this house- it’s too big for just a baby and I plus the dog he just had to have that’s currently curled up in bed with me.

*Clarification- have you moved out yet?*

>Oh I’m sorry! I’m still in the shared home- he moved out to stay with his family until he finds another place

**Update (Same Post): February 12, 2024 (2 days later)**

I’m making an edit because I’m not sure this sub will let me do an update post-

I was told I’m not allowed to change the locks due to it being his home as well and he came over last night knowing there wasn’t crap I could do to prevent it. Thankfully he only grabbed some personal belongings, threatened to take the dogs (he did not) and let me know he emptied our shared account. Part of me rolled my eyes and figured he wasn’t dumb enough to do that, and the other part made me make a mental note to check it once he left.

Sure enough our account has maybe $5 in it, he did a transfer which I’ll be calling the bank about and speaking to an attorney this afternoon. Thankfully my dad taught me you don’t fully mix finances so my savings wasn’t capable of being touched- and while it’s not a lot it’s enough to pay for the fees over the next few weeks.

I don’t have any family left so I think he’s doing a power play to make me feel like I’m alone and need him, when in all reality it’s lit a fire under my ass that I don’t want or need such a garbage person in my life.

Thank you to everyone that’s reached out with comments, kind messages and helpful advice.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1arg6r9/a_planned_pregnancy_turned_my_husband_into_a/) **1: February 15, 2024 (3 days later, 5 from OG post)**

I wanted to do an update with how many people took the time to send messages, leave comments and share their own personal stories- which especially helped make me not feel so alone.

As mentioned in an edited post- I was not allowed to change the locks on our house due to both of our names being on it. I never feared for my safety, it was more so an annoyance. He showed up to grab some personal belongings and I thought that what be the most that would happen. It was like he was trying to get a reaction from me- he told me he transferred funds and emptied out the account, I didn’t believe him until I saw it myself. That was both of our money, so that’s being dealt with currently.

He showed up the day before yesterday completely drunk, begging to talk, increasing in anger when I would just ignore him and walk away. It kept increasing so I went to grab my bag and walk down the road to a neighbors home so I wasn’t alone. He grabbed my arm to stop me and when i yanked it away, he slapped me- almost a backhanded open slap.

The cops were called, I didn’t have a mark on my face so it was a my word vs his- they escorted him off the property and I’m only now assuming he’s back with his parents now, he did throw a fit about the dogs and does have proof of ownership so im guessing he’ll be able to take them.

Went to leave to go for a drive to clear my head after everything and realized 3 of my 4 tires were flat, I know it was him but I don’t have proof. Insurance won’t cover it, so going to a tire shop on Friday morning. Just another drop in the bucket

As for the attorney I’ve had my consult and I’m waiting for my check to come in for my actual appointment and getting the ball moving on this.

There’s not any family left, and a few close friends are kept in the loop but I don’t want to burden them or treat them like unpaid therapists so I think that’s why I came back to reddit. Something therapeutic about just typing it all out into the void.

The baby/pregnancy is okay- I’ve actually lost weight, and the doctor has told me to avoid stressful situations and to take things easy.

I’ll be calling to see if I can change the locks on the home now and if not I’m going to start looking for places.

***Relevant Comments:***

*It's ok to burden one of your friends. Otherwise you could stay in a women's shelter for safety:*

>Staying with friends isn’t possible, a lot are out of state and lawyer mentioned abandonment of assets, plus my job and doctor are here.

I do have someone coming out and putting a few cameras up and thankfully the neighborhood is aware and keeping an eye out.

This is all short term of course and the goal is to leave, there’s just a ton of reasons why that can’t be right this moment

(a different commenter)Unfortunately, all of my friends are out of state and too far away from my work, doctor, and I was recommended to stay on the property so he couldn’t go after me for abandoning the assets

*OOP's best friend:*

>Thank you- while I’m trying to do what I can and stay safe- my friends are on the other side of the us, what we’re doing right now is FaceTimes and phone calls. My best friend has outright said if she calls and I don’t call back within 5 minutes of our setup time she’s calling the police.

She also put in for some time off of work and wants to come up to help me look at places and just be there in general.

I’m not going to lie I’m struggling in every way possible and I’m scared but I know I have a support system to lean on.

*Cameras:*

>My neighbor has some they’re letting me use until I can afford to buy some better ones- they have video but no audio. At this point I’m glad knowing I’ll at least have something.

*I hope you get that money back:*

>I really hope so too, he seriously transferred everything but $5 from the checking and the savings ( which didn’t even have his name on it)

*Wait how?*

>Yeah, we had a shared laptop and I didn’t think he could get into it but I’m somehow thinking he managed with passwords or something. I’ve filed a dispute with the bank and they’re investigating it, along with a fraud report at the police station.

The bank mentioned with it being my husband they may not approve the dispute, so that’s why I went and did a report at the police station.

*Relationship with inlaws/can you start the divorce proceedings sooner than the birth?*

>While I would consider it a civil relationship with the in laws, they are his parents and in their eyes he can do no wrong. He’s an only child and they have a very very close relationship. His mother apologized on his behalf but asked me to put myself in his shoes. They’re choosing to wear blinders to the whole situation.

With the divorce that’s the whole attorney thing- I’ve done a free consultation, the attorney and I agreed with the assets and how things are going it won’t be a mediation(?) and will be a long expensive court battle knowing how spiteful he’s being.

They have recommended a police report on any issue to have it filed, to not block contact with him for proof of harassment and think the best course of action is selling the property and splitting assets.

Id love to just focus on my pregnancy and myself but due to safety reasons I’m staying on top of legal issues

He broke in late last night, I was able to contact the police before I confronted him but due to location I knew it would be a bit.

I tried walking by him to leave the house but everytime I would he’d shove me, once hard enough to make me stumble and fall backwards.

The eerie part is he never once yelled- threw things-one of the items hit me causing an emergency room visit requiring stitches, said the most vile things- he hated me, I should kill myself, how useless I was etc. yet never once raised his voice, I’m not saying that in a good way- I wish he would have yelled, it was a fight or flight instinct and I found out mine was to freeze. I hate that for myself.

He was arrested and his mother already bailed him out, im staying at a hotel thanks to a work advance and looking into apartments. I won’t be stepping a foot into that home we shared until my best friend is here and even then it will be with police being with us.

Nobody can figure out what made him change almost overnight, only thing I’m guessing is a psychotic break, but I’m not a therapist or doctor.

Besides some ugly bruises and some stitches myself and the baby are fine. My lawyer feels like this is enough to get a protection order for myself and will include the pregnancy/baby.

Next time I see him will be at court, sorry I’m rambling and maybe this doesn’t make any sense.

For now- I’m safe, can sleep good for the first time in weeks. I have the dogs. Nobody is aware of where I am besides one close person, and the police.

Final update- I changed my locks, figured if he’d get the law Involved I’d use pregnancy brain and being forgetful to give him a spare set.

*Could it be a head injury?*

>I wish he was hit in the head, fucker deserves it.

On a serious note- no nothing changed, no outside stress, no injuries, nothing that I’m aware of.

I know it sounds unbelievable but once the mask slipped gloves were off. I think he thought he wanted it, to the point where he tried to believe that is what he wanted/the right thing to do.

It’s hard it’s so damn hard, I wish I could hate him but I just feel sorry for him. That does not mean I will ever go back, or at this point talk to him without the law involved. I’m choosing myself and the little one and really it’s his loss.

*Can you get an abortion?*

>I’ve had a couple of those comments so don’t take this reply personally just the one I’m using.

Abortion is not in the books for me- I’m not anti abortion and I feel like it’s a right women should have and it’s heartbreaking what our nation is going through when it comes to women having that striped away.

I’m 6 months pregnant, I can feel her move, I love her, she isn’t a fetus to me she is a baby. If I was 4-8 weeks yeah maybe it would have been an option but it isn’t now

I will take every step in making sure we are protected, I will love her enough for the both of us, I will not let her sperm donor have the opportunity to hurt her.

Police met me at my home to grab some personal belongings and pretty much anything and everything else I could grab.

Thanks to the user who recommended me calling the non emergency number it was smooth sailing- he wasn’t home, I didn’t have the fear of him showing up and both officers were very kind.

What I walked into on the other hand was not very fun- this man looked like he went on a bender. Bleach on clothes, food everywhere, personal belongings just destroyed, especially the nursery. I was able to salvage a lot of the bigger items and packed what I could, they’re now in storage until I move into my place.

Took pictures and as aggravating as it was especially with the one step forward two steps back Im hopeful that they’ll just be another thing used against him to prevent custody.

As far as him- he has no way of contacting other then attorney or email and it’s been quiet on both ends, his parents have not reached out I don’t even know what I’d say to them if they tried so no loss there. His girlfriend yes girlfriend as I found out has been trying to contact me via friends to let me know she’s pregnant, I’m unsure if that’s true or not but that in the very least confirms the affair and how well he kept things hidden.

I do want to clear the air I made a post asking for helpful information on resources that could potentially help and someone made a comment saying I was in it for a “ long con” and that’s just untrue- I have not and will not accept any personal items/donations other then advice and maybe an internet hug. (**Editor's note- OOP deleted the post she is referencing. See comment below.)**

While I wish my story was made up, it is not. Maybe it’s a venting board maybe it’s just connecting with people that have been in the same situation but it’s helps keep me sane.

Anyway I’ll leave it at thank you all for listening and checking up on me- I’m safe I’m good, pregnancy is the only thing kicking my ass and I’ll make sure to make a post in a few months letting y’all know she’s here and that we made it. Bye for now ❤️

***OOP's comment on this post:***

Oh trust me I’m having bad days with it especially emotionally, I’m sure the hormones aren’t helping.

I’ve debated if I turned a blind eye and if there really weren’t any red flags.

I’ve had moments where I’ve missed him because it’s not just a switch- we loved each other or at least I loved him. This is a person I planned a future and had a past with.

It’s really just an emotional rollercoaster and that’s okay. I don’t think there’s a right or wrong way to handle all of this but I’m doing my best

***OOP's comment on the post she deleted:***

I’m not asking for money and I’m sorry if it came across that way- I can provide proof and anything else.

I’ve had multiple people reach out and ask if they could help and I’ve always turned it down- the only thing I’m asking is for someone to point me in the way of an organization that I may not know of. If that’s coming across as that way though I can and will delete my post it wasn’t my intention

# *****New Updates*****

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRA_86739/comments/1b7hcqr/you_guys/) **4: March 5, 2024 (1 week later)**

I’ve read every single message and the majority of the comments. Thank you for sharing your experiences, your advice, your love.

More then a few have offered baby items, groceries and gift cards. I cannot in good will accept any of those but if you have items laying around please consider donating them to a charity that helps homeless parents.

One thing that stuck out is someone asked how I could feel sorry for him? I guess I’m an empathic person, to the point where it could be a flaw. I wish if he was so unhappy he would have just told me, we could have fixed it before it became violent and if it wasn’t fixable we could have both been amazing parents.

His girlfriend that reached out wrote an email in which was forwarded to me. She’s saying she’s pregnant and for her sake I hope she’s not. She’s accusing me of ruining a “good” man’s reputation, she called the injuries self inflicted and how they want a paternity test 🙄 My personal favorite was if my baby is actually his she hopes- her baby can grow up with her and have a sister. Little does she know I will go to hell and back to make sure that man does not know anything about my daughter.

As for him, I’ve seen him once while leaving the grocery store. Outside me was calm cool collected, acted like he was a stranger I wouldn’t give a second look at. On the inside I said oh shit about 500 times and cried in the car.

Money situation is fixed (work bonus and promotion) I’ve bought a new and better living room suite and having a painting party at the end of the month. You’re all invited btw.

Still good, still safe, slowly learning to love my new normal.

If you’re in a similar situation or in an abusive relationship man or woman reach out: you’re not alone. You don’t need to be brave, I’m certainly not. You just need that “I can’t do this anymore” to light that fire.

***Relevant Comments:***

Commenter: I’m a petty Betty and would have posted the GFs text about “ruining a good man’s reputation” right next to all the destruction of the house….. let EVERYONE see what a “good man” he is

>**OOP:** You know petty me wanted to show her the texts, the pictures, the well everything.

I’m going to let him show her himself, because until he does I’ll just be that vindictive lying ex.

I was perfect to that man- I poured endless love into our marriage, I spoiled him, I was a best friend, a therapist and probably his biggest hype man and if he can leave that he can leave anything.

There’s no bad issues- I want to see her eat just not at my table type of thing but I’m treating her just like I do him like they’re nothing but a stranger to me.

He doesn’t have to go on the birth certificate and really after the divorce and court dates I don’t think I’ll allow either of them to be a second thought in my head.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1f9vn5y/planned_pregnancy_turned_my_exhusband_into_a/) **5: September 9, 2024 (6 months later, 7 from OG post)**

Hi! It’s been awhile since I’ve posted, I mean last time I posted I had swollen ankles, waddled, thought every little cramp was a contraction and felt like life was falling apart. I want to thank everyone who reached out even months after the fact just to check in on a stranger.

My daughter is here, for privacy im going to leave out her dob but she was 6 pounds two ounces and the most beautiful head of hair I’ve seen (she’s now got the hair style of Danny Devito)

My original posts are still up in case anyway is looking at this with puzzlement. But to say things have been rough would be an understatement. He showed up to the hospital, thankfully everyone was aware and hospital staff handled it properly and perfectly and I was able to focus on labor and delivery. Unfortunately the stress of that alone took an already hectic moment in time and amp’d it up but things could have been so much worse and I’m highly thankful they were not.

Right now I’ve got about 10 different cps calls, they’ve came to my house on 4 occasions. His family and him have filed for an emergency custody hearing and due to leaving the state with my daughter that did give him a foot in the door. It seems the protective order isn’t really helping in that matter. I am still on maternity leave so thankfully my focus has fully been on my daughter, and collecting all the evidence to make sure he doesn’t get any custody other then possibly supervised visits for an hour. My main concern is if he doesn’t get any custody that his parents may do the grandparent route.

I wish it was an update to say I’m kicking motherhoods ass and taking names but most of the time I feel like a burnt out blob- I am in therapy and the doctors are keeping an eye on postpartum depression, yet my doctor thinks a giant hemorrhoid (ex) is the cause instead.

Don’t have an update on the girlfriend of his, have kept the dogs I think they love the little one just as much as I do. Am excited and anxious to see where the next chapter of life will take me.

*Don't worry about Grandparents' rights:*

>Thank you for this. The rational side of my brain knows that they have a slim to none chance of getting anywhere, yet the exhausted overstimulated hormones all over the place keep going “what if” so anytime that fear creeps back in I’ll come back to your comment and read it a few times

**OOP** [Posted](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRA_86739/comments/1f9vtmt/baby_is_here/) **on her own page, with some of the same info but also more detail:**

**Title:** Baby is here:

Well honestly she’s been here for a bit but still a newb at life. She was born with a head full of black hair, 6 pounds 2 ounces and was alert from the very start.

I made an update on true of my chest but making a small one here just in case it gets taken down.

Cps has been called numerous times, and came out for a few visits. Everything from I was living in filth, to I was leaving the baby home alone, to that I was addicted to meth has been said and investigated and proved wrong. I did leave the state, and that got his foot in the door for an emergency custody battle which will be coming up soon. The protective order was a joke and has been unhelpful. The man showed up to the hospital while I was in labor but thankfully the hospital staff handled it perfectly. The cops not so much, but didn’t expect it.

I think his parents are the biggest push in the custody thing but I don’t think he’ll get granted more than a few supervised visits. My main concern is if that happens his grandparents going after grandparent rights. To protect their reputation it’s highly likely they will.

Unfortunately I don’t have an update on his girlfriend.

But I did keep the dogs aka the gruesome twosome and I think they love the little one just as much as I do.

Thank you all for still caring and messaging/checking in months later. It means more then I can say

***Relevant Comments:***

Commenter: How did he find out you were in labor so he could show up at the hospital? Do you have a mole feeding him info? 

>**OOP:** I’m assuming so yes, most likely a coworker or at least that is my best guess.

Commenter: \[why they have a claim to emergency custody\] I think they probably tried to file for emergency custody claiming that she was ""kidnapping"" the baby by moving out of state

>**OOP:** Exactly what happened- they said kidnapping/fleeing the state. From what I understand from my lawyer that won’t hold but I am required to do a paternity test since he’s not on her birth certificate.

Why he gets this chance I have no clue. It’s exhausting and I think it’s a control/scare tactic to keep his family happy.

Going to use this comment to just add in two other questions from this post that I can’t find-

Someone mentioned an AirTag. I called a garage explained the situation they’re going to have me drop It off and go over it with a fine tooth comb so if the person that mentioned that is reading this- a big big thank you.

As for the coworkers/someone leaking information I’ve stayed silent ever since.

Finally I cannot get them in trouble with false accusations with cps because they’re making anonymous reports. I know it’s them, my lawyer knows it’s them, heck at this point the caseworker’s probably know it’s them but legally it’s anonymous and they’ll just decline saying/reporting anything.

*Pictures of his destruction:*

>Thank you so so much! I have not kept the pictures personally but my lawyer has them, police documents, the texts, the voicemails. I couldn’t physically keep them in my home because I would look at them over and over again trying to figure out what I missed, where it went wrong, what I could have done to prevent it. It made my mental health spiral.

Neither one of us (lawyer and I) believe that he has a chance when it comes to custody but neither one of us thought he’d get his foot in the door as far as he has either.

Right now it’s focusing on the baby, the dogs, and keeping my physical/mental health in a good place. So thankful for Reddit and everyone that checks in because it’s been therapeutic in a way.

In all reality I need some dad advice. Life has been hectic, crazy, scary, defeating, I’m still going and keeping my head up because I just had a baby and wont let her down.

A kind redditor sent me over here because I’m looking at most importantly the safest but also the easiest way to sell things online. Every place seems to have its downfall- eBay seems like the best, but I’m unsure. Craigslist seems simple fast easy but scammers and the meeting someone online (where’s the best place to meet? Is cash best? Should I take a friend?) makes me question my sanity. A gaming store seems hopeful and the safest but I’ve also heard they’ll give you bottom dollar for anything you can bring in.

This is jumbled and a mess but if you see this and have any kind, helpful so desperately needed dad advice I need it. A dad joke wouldn’t hurt either."
Stop Pretending There is a Possibility of Recovery if the US Economy Fails,"I have seen a lot of people likening our situation now to that of 2008, hyper inflation in the 70s-80s and the great depression... but It is so much worse than that. Our failure to recognize the implied threat of corporate monopolies and the oligarch class will lead to the drastic decline into authoritarian rule and the economic downfall of the United States. 

  
The best part about all of this is that anyone who recognizes this is crazy and the people who live outside of objective reality will believe their leaders are doing what is best for the country. Both parties have contributed to this systemic failure and we as a species have forgotten that legislation has always been the compromise to violence, and that governments are allowed to rule only by the will of the people they serve... when will true action take place to right this ship? 

Prepare yourself for servitude and the reduction of your identity to labor value and production. 

# 1. The U.S. Population is More Dependent on Government and Corporate Infrastructure Than Ever Before

One of the most overlooked aspects of past economic downturns is that people were far more self-sufficient during previous crises than they are today.

* During the Great Depression (1929–1939):
   * Nearly 25% of Americans lived in rural areas, where they had direct access to farmland, livestock, and local supply chains.
   * Families often grew their own food, produced their own goods, and had strong community barter systems.
   * The federal government was much smaller and had fewer direct control mechanisms over people's daily lives.
   * Basic services (water, electricity, heating) were more localized and did not rely on complex national grids or corporate monopolies.
* Today’s Reality (2025):
   * Fewer than 1.3% of Americans work in agriculture, meaning the overwhelming majority rely on grocery stores and supply chains controlled by private corporations.
   * Public and private utilities (electricity, water, internet, fuel) are centralized and privatized, meaning failures in these systems can quickly lead to widespread chaos.
   * The rise of just-in-time supply chains means grocery stores, gas stations, and pharmacies carry minimal stock—any major supply chain disruption would lead to shortages in days, not months.
   * Over 50 million Americans rely on government assistance programs (SNAP, Medicaid, Social Security) to meet their basic needs. Any disruption to these programs would lead to immediate suffering.

The idea that Americans today could ""tough it out"" the way previous generations did is entirely unrealistic. Our society has been engineered for dependency, and that dependency is controlled by for-profit corporations whose only obligation is to their shareholders—not the public.

# 2. Privatized Essential Services Pose an Existential Threat in a Crisis

Unlike during past crises, many of the industries necessary for survival—healthcare, food, transportation, energy—are fully privatized and operated for profit. This creates catastrophic vulnerabilities that did not exist during the Great Depression or even the 2008 financial crisis.

# A. Healthcare is No Longer a Public Service, It’s a For-Profit Monopoly

* In 1929, the cost of healthcare was low and largely provided by community hospitals and non-profit institutions.
* Today, healthcare is a corporate behemoth where a trip to the ER can bankrupt a family overnight—even if the economy collapses, hospitals and insurance companies will still demand payment.
* 75% of Americans already live paycheck to paycheck, meaning a job loss + no health insurance = medical bankruptcy.
* In the event of mass unemployment or economic breakdown, millions will be left without healthcare access.

# B. Food Production is Controlled by a Handful of Corporate Giants

* A century ago, most people had access to local food production.
* Today, only a handful of multinational conglomerates (Cargill, Tyson, JBS, Archer Daniels Midland) control most food production.
* 85% of U.S. meat production is controlled by four companies—meaning any breakdown in the supply chain leads to immediate food shortages.

# C. Power and Water Are Privatized and Vulnerable

* During the Great Depression, most energy infrastructure was localized—power outages in one state didn't affect the entire grid.
* Today, vast portions of the U.S. are dependent on regional energy monopolies that can cut services instantly for non-payment.
* Example: During Texas' 2021 power crisis, privatized electricity providers charged some customers $10,000 in utility bills.
* In a financial collapse, energy companies won’t ""help""—they’ll shut off power and water to anyone who can’t pay.

# D. Housing is No Longer About Shelter—It’s an Investment Market

* In the 1930s, the majority of homes were owned outright or had manageable mortgages.
* Today, the housing market is dominated by investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard, which buy up homes and rent them out at skyrocketing rates.
* The average American cannot afford to buy a home today, meaning millions are locked into renting from corporate landlords.
* In a collapse scenario, landlords and banks will not hesitate to mass-evict tenants who can’t pay.

# 3. There is No Safety Net This Time—The Government is Bankrupt

During both the Great Depression and the 2008 financial crisis, the government intervened massively to prevent full-scale collapse:

* The New Deal (1933–1939) created Social Security, public works projects, and banking regulations to stabilize the economy.
* The 2008 Bailouts saw the U.S. inject trillions into failing banks and corporations to keep the system afloat.

However, this strategy won’t work next time—for one simple reason:  
The U.S. government is already $36 trillion in debt.

* Interest on the national debt is now the largest line item in the federal budget, surpassing even military spending.
* If the system collapses, the U.S. won’t be able to print enough money to bail itself out—without triggering hyperinflation.

The federal government is already stretched beyond its limits trying to maintain existing obligations (Social Security, Medicare, defense). If a major financial crisis hits, it simply won’t have the fiscal capacity to intervene the way it has in the past.

The 2008 crisis was a financial collapse contained within the banking system—it never fully broke society. The Great Depression was devastating, but people were far more self-sufficient and the government had the ability to intervene.

This time, it’s different.

* Americans do not have the survival skills of past generations.
* The government is already broke and cannot provide a meaningful safety net.
* Essential services are privatized, meaning corporations—not elected officials—will dictate who gets food, water, electricity, and shelter.
* Global de-dollarization is accelerating, meaning the U.S. may not be able to print money to escape economic collapse.

This won’t be ""just another recession"" or ""another 2008."" This is an entirely different kind of collapse—one where the U.S. population is far more vulnerable than ever before. This is what happens when people allow their government to engage in capitalistic ventures and remove the public servant mentality. Our political system was not designed for a global economy and the digital revolution, we are less than a year away from systemic failure and the fall of the United States as a global leader.

My observations of wealthier/successful people as a hotel worker.,"**TL;DR: I work in a 5-star hotel and have noticed clear behavioral differences between wealthy and lower-class guests. Wealthier people tend to be simple, organized, and efficient—minimal luggage, clean car interiors, quick and hassle-free transactions, and they almost never lose their valet tickets. Lower-class guests often bring excessive, unnecessary items, have cluttered cars, misplace their valet tickets constantly, and make things more complicated for themselves.

I work in a 5-star hotel where rooms range from $200 to $1,000 USD per night, depending on the tier, season, and demand. Even a basic room can go for over $1,000 on New Year's Eve.

One thing I’ve noticed that often really separates the higher-class guests from the lower-class ones—beyond just money—is their **simplicity and organization** in how they handle themselves.

Wealthier guests tend to arrive, hand over their keys without hesitation, and move on with zero fuss after the essential info is handed over. They don’t overcomplicate things. Their luggage is minimal, well-packed, and often in a matching set that’s easy to move around. A lot of them just carry their own bags because it’s faster and more convenient, but even when they need help, their stuff is simple to handle. Their cars? Almost always clean and organized inside—regardless of whether the exterior is spotless or covered in dust.

Even one time, we had a very wealthy family from Malaysia visit. Possible political/monarchy connections. They tipped like crazy and often people dont tip in my country. They had 2-3 rooms and a fair amount of luggage. On departure they filled 3 Mercedes vans from the Malaysian Embassy with luggage with the seats folded down. It was easy considering they were all congruent suitcases and easy to squeeze in.

Beyond that, they’re low-maintenance and efficient in communication. Obviously, there are exceptions, but in general, rich people don’t waste time complaining about nonsense or trying to finesse freebies. Even when they do have a legitimate issue, they bring it up in a way that’s calm, direct, and solution-focused instead of being dramatic or entitled. They also tend to trust the process. They don’t hover around the valet, questioning if their car will be safe. They don’t ask the front desk a million basic things they could Google in two seconds. They understand that hotels have systems in place, and they just go with the flow.

Meanwhile, a lot of (not all) lower and middle-class guests operate on a completely different wavelength. They often show up with way too much stuff—excessive carry bags, heavy non-rolling luggage, random loose items stuffed into shopping bags or tossed onto the backseat. I’ve seen people bring massive powered eskies, bags full of groceries, and an entire wardrobe for a one-night stay. One guy even had a whole trunk full of frozen food… for a two-night stay. They tend to bring things they think they’ll need, but in reality, they’re just overpacking and making their own lives harder.

A smaller but very telling detail? Valet collection tickets. In case youre unsure, every peraon is given a valet ticket to collect their vehicle. If they dont have it, we need photo ID and search it up which can be a lengthy process. 

Wealthy guests almost never lose them. They keep them in their wallet, a specific pocket, or somewhere they can grab it instantly. The second they return, they hand it over—no fumbling, no searching. Lower-class guests? Constantly losing them. They shove them into random bags, crumple them into their pockets, or straight-up forget where they put them. Half the time, they’ll show up at the valet stand empty-handed, then spend five minutes patting their clothes, digging through their bags, and swearing they “just had it.” Some even argue that they never got one in the first place, like we’re supposed to magically remember their car out of the 50-100+ we park every day.

The biggest difference I’ve noticed? Wealthy and successful people operate like essentialists. They only bring what they actually need. Their approach to travel is smooth, efficient, and stress-free.

And here’s the thing: it’s not just about money. I’ve seen middle-class people who carry themselves with this level of organization and simplicity, and they stand out just as much as the rich.

Throwaway account for anonymity.

I (31F) married my soon to be ex-husband (M33) in 2018. My in-laws never liked me and made it clear. STBX insisted that they're just putting up a tough exterior and they'll grow to love me.

To show how evil they are, one time I joined them for dinner and brought a cake I'd made (because I was always raised to be a gracious guest). When I stepped into the kitchen and offered the cake to his mother as a thank you for inviting me, she took the plate over to the garbage bin, dumped it in, and handed me the plate back. When I told my husband what she did, he confronted her and all of a sudden the crocodile tears started and she claimed she grabbed the plate but didn't get a good grip, I let go to quickly, and it fell to the floor, so of course it had to be thrown away. My SIL ""confirmed"" that was what happened.

My STBX owned his own business and they called me a gold-digger behind his back. Of course they insisted on a pre-nup, which I didn't care about because I never thought my marriage would end and it would appease them and may allow them to finally treat me kindly. Nope. His business failed once covid hit. We went through his savings and my own trying to keep it afloat. I refused to go into debt to keep it going, so he closed it down.

In 2022, he was suffering from really bad depression because he lost his business and couldn't find new work. He suggested we move to his hometown, closer to his family, so he had a larger support network. Against my best judgement we did.

He wanted to only work part time while he tried to restart his business, so I became the main breadwinner. And as with most wives, I became the person in charge of buying gifts. Stupid ol' me thought buying them thoughtful, expensive gifts would finally make them see I wanted to be accepted by them. Gifts to us were a ""couples gift"" but clearly for my STBX only.

Every holiday was spent with them. Monthly dinners with the whole family. After a year, I realised that if I ever tried to talk or join a conversation, everyone would go quiet, so I just stopped talking when I visited.

In early December they finalized plans for Christmas. A few days later my STBX said his family decided they didn't want me to join them for Christmas Eve Dinner and Christmas Lunch because I ruin the family vibe. I replied, ""Fine, we'll do our own thing instead."" My STBX sheepishly looked away and said he was still going to go.

I was livid and so disappointed in him. That was the moment I knew my marriage was over.

So I returned the presents I had bought for his family. In their place, I got one pair of novelty business socks for FIL, a supermarket brand bottle of shampoo for MIL, the nastiest perfume I could find at the dollar store for SIL. The most expensive gift was a large rawhide bone for BIL and his wife's chihuahua (too big for it to get its jaw around, rendering it useless).

I saved about $600 to put on a deposit for a new apartment.

My husband come home from Christmas lunch telling me I humiliated him and embarrassed him in front of his family. I asked him why would he think I'd buy nice gifts for people who clearly don't like me and don't want me around?

Served divorce papers last week. Remember how he was supposed to be a millionaire by now so we had that pre-nup? STBX is not eligible for any of my savings (it was required to keep separate accounts) or alimony. He doesn't have money for rent and auto insurance. Not my problem anymore.

Some of my friends and family and on my side and proud that I went out in a blaze of glory. Others are telling me I was being way too petty, which isn't really like me. So, AITA?

Keeping it in because it's actually hilarious. Beep beep!

>**OOP:** He only worked 12 hours a week at Walmart to he could do non-existent work restarting his business. I make just over 6 figures and I can't believe I didn't realize years ago I was the family ATM.

Commenter: NTA So thoughtful of them to insist on a pre-nup! I hope you send them a sincere thank you note after the divorce is finalized, lol.

>**OOP:** My lawyer even laughed that the pre-nup that was set up *for him* is going to be what we use *for me*.  
It required both spouses to maintain separate bank accounts and each spouse could keep 100% of their savings. No spouse eligible for alimony.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ijdwi0/update_aita_for_giving_crappy_christmas_gifts_and/)**: February 6, 2025 (10 days later)**

Many thanks to everyone for their support in my last post. I thought I'd send a small update.

First, for those who asked how the deposit on my new apartment was only the $600 I saved on the gifts, it certainly wasn't. I had to dip into savings, but that $600 helped.

My STBX didn't bother reaching out to me after I left until he was served the divorce papers and my lawyer made it clear we're exercizing the pre-nup. Then it was loving voicemails and texts (I never picked up) from him and his family for a few days trying to convince me to come back, which eventually turned to threatening and cruel voicemails and texts when it was clear I wasn't budging.

My lawyer suggested I don't block them so we have evidence of harassment, if needed. Basically, give them the rope to hang themselves with.

But then last night I got call after call from my STBX. Stupidly, I picked it up thinking there was some kind of emergency or something. I barely got ""Hello"" out when he said, ""The rent is a week late."" I told him that's strange because I paid my landlord 6 days ago. He paused and sighed dramatically and replied, ""No, the rent for *here*."" I reminded him I don't live there and he shouldn't expect rent. Cue his parents both texting me that they're going to sue me to pay the remainder of the lease entirely.

I'm not worried about having an eviction on my record, since the apartment is in his parents' names. When we first announced we were moving to his hometown, they rented an apartment for us right away so we could move right in. They've been renewing the lease each year. We had to pay his parents and then they write a check to the landlord, who has no idea who STBX and I are, let alone that we lived there. Red flag, I know. I'm glad I had a few weeks to prep my leaving since they'd probably use the fact that it's *their* apartment to kick me out immediately.

Divorce is probably going to be a bumpy ride with this manchild and his psycho parents. Any advice from anyone who's been through it is welcome.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Do you even have a contract at the place your stbx is living? I don't think they have a basis for suing you, lol. What does your lawyer say?

>**OOP:** Lawyer is confident they have no leg to stand on. I haven't signed any type of lease and utilities are in their name, too, because they were afraid of having too many names connected to the apartment and the landlord finding out. So they are on the hook for everything that doesn't get paid. But, hey, that was their choice and their scheming. FAFO.

**\*\*\*\*\*New Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1itggz9/update_2_aita_for_giving_crappy_christmas_gifts/)**: February 19, 2025 (13 days later, 23 from OG post)\*\*\*\*\***

Hi, if this isn't the right place to post any updates, please direct me to a subreddit that better fits. Super sorry if I'm annoying members who aren't interested, but a few requested an update.

1st post: My husband's family uninvited me from Christmas. Husband still left and made me celebrate Christmas alone. I organized shitty gifts as a final bird flip.

1st update: I moved out and my underemployed STBX and his family still expected me to pay rent on the apartment in my in-laws' names.

So the people who commented that my soon to be former in-laws were probably charging my STBX and me more than the amount on the lease, you called it. And we wouldn't have found out if they weren't so entitled and determined to hurt me.

They got a cousin who happens to be a lawyer to send me a letter demanding I pay the entirety of the remainder of the lease or they will file suit and force me to pay it. Clearly a scare tactic. So my lawyer sent a formal request to their lawyer for a copy of the lease (which I've never seen) and a copy of their written agreement with us as sublesees (which doesn't exist).

They sent the lease and insisted the sublease agreement was a verbal contract. Not only is subleasing explicitly prohibited, but my mother-in-law and father-in-law had been charging us an extra $200 each month. So we've notified the landlord that I've been living there with my STBX and the leasees were living in their own house throughout the duration of the lease, and sent copies of my driver's license (with the address) and over two years of bank and credit card statements with the address listed. They were served with a 30-day eviction yesterday, which I know about because MIL left a voicemail about me kicking my STBX out of his home and that she now drives with a baseball bat in her car and she'll be keeping an eye out for me, lol.

Obviously, my lawyer's expertise is family law and this was out of her purview, so she refered me to a colleague who focuses on real estate law. We met today to devise a battle plan and I am now suing my MIL and FIL for *all* the money I can prove I transferred for rent for the entirety of the residency there, since the apartment was technically not a legal apartment to rent since they couldn't sublease (no clean hands to rent to us and then sue me). He's not sure how a judge will buy it and it's way beyond my state's civil compensation limit, but he's confident that it will scare them and leave them open to settling for just returning the additional $200 from each payment. Which I think is fair, because I *did* live there with my STBX so I don't think it's right to get all the rent money back. I'm an adult and adults pay rent. And I don't want them to have the satisfaction of saying I'm using the divorce as a windfall.

On the STBX front, there's no news there. We will likely need to go to Family Court for a separation order since he won't agree to the financial details of the separation agreement my lawyer has drafted. My state requires a 1-year separation period before a divorce can be finalized, so this is going to be a long process.

A few people asked why he did what he did and if he's offered any kind of explanation or justification. We haven't really talked since he was served. I don't know if he just fell out of love but I was still financially convenient, or if the mask finally lifted, or if it was being so close to his family and them having opportunities to manipulate him.

I don't know and I don't care. I don't need closure, I need them all gone. Looking back, making promises during couples counseling and slowly regressing back is enough closure. Knowing he allowed his family to treat me like crap for so long is closure. That final betrayal at Christmas is closure. My focus isn't on figuring it out, it's making sure I'm happy.

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

Commenter: Keep their calls and texts messages as evidence for a protective order.

>**OOP:** Absolutely. She's going to regret it because she works for the school district and a restraining order won't let her teach.

Commenter: Don't forget to investigate sueing for return of money invested in his business.

It was premarital asset, and exempt from prenup.

Worth a shot to see if you can recover some/all of that wasted savings

>**OOP:** I had never thought of this! I'll bring it up when I meet with my lawyer next.

Divorce is probably going to be a bumpy ride with this manchild and his psycho parents. Any advice from anyone who's been through it is welcome.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Do you even have a contract at the place your stbx is living? I don't think they have a basis for suing you, lol. What does your lawyer say?

>**OOP:** Lawyer is confident they have no leg to stand on. I haven't signed any type of lease and utilities are in their name, too, because they were afraid of having too many names connected to the apartment and the landlord finding out. So they are on the hook for everything that doesn't get paid. But, hey, that was their choice and their scheming. FAFO.

**\*\*\*\*\*New Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1itggz9/update_2_aita_for_giving_crappy_christmas_gifts/)**: February 19, 2025 (13 days later, 23 from OG post)\*\*\*\*\***

Hi, if this isn't the right place to post any updates, please direct me to a subreddit that better fits. Super sorry if I'm annoying members who aren't interested, but a few requested an update.

1st post: My husband's family uninvited me from Christmas. Husband still left and made me celebrate Christmas alone. I organized shitty gifts as a final bird flip.

1st update: I moved out and my underemployed STBX and his family still expected me to pay rent on the apartment in my in-laws' names.

So the people who commented that my soon to be former in-laws were probably charging my STBX and me more than the amount on the lease, you called it. And we wouldn't have found out if they weren't so entitled and determined to hurt me.

They got a cousin who happens to be a lawyer to send me a letter demanding I pay the entirety of the remainder of the lease or they will file suit and force me to pay it. Clearly a scare tactic. So my lawyer sent a formal request to their lawyer for a copy of the lease (which I've never seen) and a copy of their written agreement with us as sublesees (which doesn't exist).

They sent the lease and insisted the sublease agreement was a verbal contract. Not only is subleasing explicitly prohibited, but my mother-in-law and father-in-law had been charging us an extra $200 each month. So we've notified the landlord that I've been living there with my STBX and the leasees were living in their own house throughout the duration of the lease, and sent copies of my driver's license (with the address) and over two years of bank and credit card statements with the address listed. They were served with a 30-day eviction yesterday, which I know about because MIL left a voicemail about me kicking my STBX out of his home and that she now drives with a baseball bat in her car and she'll be keeping an eye out for me, lol.

Obviously, my lawyer's expertise is family law and this was out of her purview, so she refered me to a colleague who focuses on real estate law. We met today to devise a battle plan and I am now suing my MIL and FIL for *all* the money I can prove I transferred for rent for the entirety of the residency there, since the apartment was technically not a legal apartment to rent since they couldn't sublease (no clean hands to rent to us and then sue me). He's not sure how a judge will buy it and it's way beyond my state's civil compensation limit, but he's confident that it will scare them and leave them open to settling for just returning the additional $200 from each payment. Which I think is fair, because I *did* live there with my STBX so I don't think it's right to get all the rent money back. I'm an adult and adults pay rent. And I don't want them to have the satisfaction of saying I'm using the divorce as a windfall.

On the STBX front, there's no news there. We will likely need to go to Family Court for a separation order since he won't agree to the financial details of the separation agreement my lawyer has drafted. My state requires a 1-year separation period before a divorce can be finalized, so this is going to be a long process.

A few people asked why he did what he did and if he's offered any kind of explanation or justification. We haven't really talked since he was served. I don't know if he just fell out of love but I was still financially convenient, or if the mask finally lifted, or if it was being so close to his family and them having opportunities to manipulate him.

I don't know and I don't care. I don't need closure, I need them all gone. Looking back, making promises during couples counseling and slowly regressing back is enough closure. Knowing he allowed his family to treat me like crap for so long is closure. That final betrayal at Christmas is closure. My focus isn't on figuring it out, it's making sure I'm happy.

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

Commenter: Keep their calls and texts messages as evidence for a protective order.

>**OOP:** Absolutely. She's going to regret it because she works for the school district and a restraining order won't let her teach.

Commenter: Don't forget to investigate sueing for return of money invested in his business.

It was premarital asset, and exempt from prenup.

Worth a shot to see if you can recover some/all of that wasted savings

>**OOP:** I had never thought of this! I'll bring it up when I meet with my lawyer next.

*The lease agreement:* 

>When we first told his family we were moving back to his home town, his parents went ahead and signed a lease for us, to ""make the move easier."" Personally, I think it was to make the move happen sooner and have control over us.  
They were worried about too many names attached to the apartment, so power, internet, etc is also in their name."

It's time to invest in Europe,"I've been working in finance for c. 6 years, namely in consulting for pension funds, so I constantly follow the news and developments of the new American administration made me very worried, so I decided to change my entire personal investment portfolio to invest exclusively in Europe and even ""de-Americanize"" what I can (such as browsers, search engines, social networks, etc. - see [https://european-alternatives.eu/](https://european-alternatives.eu/) if you are interested), but, being my area of ​​expertise, I will focus on why I decided to abandon the American markets and why I think they should do the same as citizens of the European Union, giving ethical and financial reasons.

Regarding personal investments, it seems to me that the main choices tend to be to invest in funds that track the S&P500 or globally diversified funds (MSCI World/MSCI All Country World) which, despite their global reach, American companies end up being c. 60% of the constituents. The argument is easy: the United States is the engine of the global economy where capitalism prevails, markets are relatively underregulated, and taxes are relatively low. Productivity is relatively high, there is political stability, there is transparency and protected property rights, and American companies are world leaders in technological innovation. Historically, profit relative to European markets reflects this

**Risk reduction**

First, I'll speak from a purely risk management perspective. By investing exclusively in the S&P500, or any other foreign index that is not currency hedged, you will be incurring **currency risk**. [The fundamental principles of passive investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_management) **do not include forex**, so if you are hoping to make the c. 10% p.a. historical profit of the S&P you can deviate immensely from this number because of fluctuations of the USD against the Euro.

Another risk to keep in mind when investing in the S&P500 is **concentration risk.** [At this date, c. 32% of the index is made up of just 7 technology companies](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B5BMR087#overview), so sector diversification is very small and you should expect much higher volatility vs the major European indices.

**Political risk** must also be taken into account, that is, the risk of your profits being affected by hostile legislation or government instability. E[very day the new administration tests the limits of the basic principles of liberalism](https://edition.cnn.com/politics/tracking-trump-executive-orders-actions-dg/index.html) on which the capitalist market is based: separation of powers, independence of the courts/central bank, fair competition in the markets, etc. T[he political program on which Trump was elected is estimated to cost $7.8tn](https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans) and the possibility of a government debt crisis cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, this administration threatens the territorial integrity of our European allies and there is the possibility of economic sanctions on European citizens as occurred in Russia shortly after the invasion of Ukraine where all investments by European citizens in Russia were considered lost by major ETFs.

**Expected returns**

One of the main arguments I see online in favor of US markets is the superior historical profits. I have to emphasize this: **historical profits do not imply future profits.**

The dramatic rises in the US stock market in recent years have made US companies extremely expensive by traditional [value investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing) metrics - a more defensive investment method that tends to perform better in times of volatility and instability.

There are also reasons to be optimistic about the future of the European Union. [The recent Draghi Report ](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/draghi-report_en)is a response to the Union’s structural problems and the European leadership seems receptive. The global geopolitical fragmentation we are experiencing seems to have been a necessary bucket of cold water and, despite everything, Europe remains a developed market that presents more stability, safeguards and, in my opinion, potential than the United States at this moment.

**The impact of your investments**

Another aspect I have to emphasize is that we cannot look at our personal investments from a purely monetary perspective. **The money you invest has an impact on the real world** and will be used by companies/governments to, for example, open more factories, increase wages, invest in research, build infrastructure, etc.

The United States is the main destination for private investment and this is one of the main causes behind the difference in productivity between the continents. Unfortunately, we can no longer count on them as reliable partners and must invest in ourselves. In addition to profit, we have to take into account that investing in the prosperity of our community is another benefit to be taken into account, and we can even choose to invest in specific and essential sectors for today, such as renewable energy companies or European defense companies.

That said, I'll leave my ETF/stock suggestions below:

**Equity ETFs:**

* **Amundi Stoxx Europe 600 UCITS ETF (LU0908500753)** \- with TER of 0.07% p.a. It's the cheapest European stock ETF I've found. Bonus points for being a European asset manager.
* edit: **Xtrackers MSCI Europe UCITS ETF 1C (LU0274209237)** \- with a TER of 0.12% p.a. it tracks c. 400-500 european large cap stocks. Bonus points for being a European asset manager.
* **iShares MSCI Europe ESG Screened UCITS ETF EUR (Acc) (IE00BFNM3D14)** \- The index offers an ESG (""environmental social and governance"") filter that avoids investing in companies with ethical problems in exchange for a TER (""total expense ratio"" i.e. what you pay the asset manager annually) higher than 0.12% p.a.
* **Vanguard ESG Developed Europe All Cap UCITS ETF (EUR) Accumulating (IE000QUOSE01)** \- This ETF is my favorite for stocks. It has an ESG filter that avoids investing in companies with ethical issues and includes smaller capitalization European companies, offering greater profits and diversification in exchange for a higher TER of 0.12% p.a.
* **Invesco Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF Acc (IE00BLRB0242)** \- invests in global companies linked to renewable energy. In addition to helping the energy transition, it seems like a great dip to buy at the moment after a massive selloff.
* edit: **Xtrackers MSCI Global SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy UCITS ETF 1C (IE000JZYIUN0**) - similar to the above fund but bonus points for being a European asset manager.

**Real Estate ETFs:**

* i**Shares European Property Yield UCITS ETF EUR Acc (IE00BGDQ0L74)** \- invests in European construction and real estate companies. It is a good stock diversifier without sacrificing too much expected profi.
* edit: **Xtrackers FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Europe Real Estate UCITS ETF 1C(LU0489337690) -** Cheaper than the above and bonus points for being an European asset manager.

**Government Bond ETFs**

* **Vanguard EUR Eurozone Government Bd UCITS ETF Acc (IE00BH04GL39) -** The cheapest etf I found that invests in European government bonds of all durations. It is a defensive component of the portfolio and can be used to reduce volatility.
* edit: **Xtrackers II Eurozone Government Bond UCITS ETF 1C (LU0290355717) -** similar to the above fund but bonus points for being a European asset manager.

**European defense stocks** \- European armaments are essential for our security and we must invest in them. I couldn't find any European defense ETFs, so I decided to buy shares of these three European defense companies:

* **Rheinmetall AG (DE0007030009)**

"I quit the job for safety reasons, then my replacement got killed","I just posted this as an answer in r/AskReddit, but then realized this needs to be posted here, as I haven't publicly shared this story before today.

I once chose a career that was paid shit for money, but I loved what I did. Unfortunately it ended up badly with miserable working conditions, toxic workplace, and two dead bodies.

I first decided to quit my decently paid job at that time (finishing carpenter) and become a tandem hang glider instructor instead. I was already a hang glider pilot at that time, even taught flying part-time for a year, and flew every weekend as a leisurely activity to help me relax and recharge. I was in my twenties and becoming a full-time instructor was my dream.

I got a job at a local hang gliding school, so I moved myself, and my very accommodating and understanding wife, to a place close to the flight park.

The school was already facing some financial hardships when I joined, and it became apparent that the ownership was cutting corners wherever they could. I was on salary, and expected to work long hours without extra compensation when it got busy.

This wasn't a big deal on most days since I really enjoyed the work, but I recall examples such as when I ended up staying hooked into the glider for 10 hours straight without a break, taking passengers one after another. And this was after already working 4 hours prior on non-flying tasks earlier that day. My shoulders and neck were in pain for days after, but I couldn't take time off to recoup.

There were also frequent issues with one of the owners. His personality was a passive-aggressive type, and it became a big issue at the flight park. He was never the kind to say what was in his mind, but would find ways to make you feel it in a way you couldn't discuss it. 

The toxicity made me consider leaving a few times, but it all came to a head after an incident which made me realize that my safety, and the safety of my students, was becoming a serious issue. Little did I know that this decision would ultimately save my life, but cost the lives of two other people.

You see, most people think of hang gliders as aircraft that are foot-launched off the side of a mountain. This is true for a lot of solo hang glider pilots, but as a flight school we were using something called air tow to get the hang gliders into the air. 

Similar to towing ordinary gliders, there is a powered aircraft at the front (in this case an ultralight specifically designed for towing hang gliders), that pulls hang gliders along to the desired altitude. Once there the glider releases, and the tug (what we call the ultralight) goes back down to pick up the next tow. This allows for way more flights in a day as one doesn't need to break down the glider, drive back up the mountain, reassemble, etc...

This tow rig typically utilizes two weak links, one at each end of the tow line, designed to break after a specific tow pressure is exceeded. This is done for safety as it mitigates the effect of a lockout, which is an involuntary manoeuvre that can put a hang glider into an uncontrolled nose dive, and even stall the tow aircraft. During a lockout, the tension on a tow line is very rapidly increased, hence utilizing weak links designed to break before the lockout becomes a threat.

In an ideal world, you would toss a weak link out after every tow and replace it with a fresh one. But when it got busy at the flight park, the extra time required to do this swap meant fewer tows in a day, which meant fewer bucks for the school. 

The owner often reused weak links until they started to show signs of wear. Now, this isn't a big deal on its own, as it merely increases the chance of a premature weak link failure. But it also entails that students be trained in case of weak link failures.

When a weak link breaks, there is a sudden loss of thrust and therefore climb. On a hang glider this results in a brief parabolic trajectory, similar to the zero-g airplane flights, albeit on a much smaller scale. The low-g event is brief and lasts maybe 1-2 seconds, but since the drastic change in wing loading is experienced as a momentary loss of control, it was my job to train new pilots how to deal with this situation without going haywire.

In essence, when there is loss of control, untrained pilots tend to increase their control inputs, which end up becoming too great as soon as the wing loading returns to normal, and this leads to an erratic flight path. This is similar to a loss of control experienced due to oversteering on slippery roads. 

The solution is to overcome the instinct to make any and all control inputs for a brief second or two, and then make the normal inputs as soon as the wing loading returns to normal. And to do that, I would teach the theory of dealing with it first, then simulate the link failure by occasionally and unexpectedly hitting a tow line release while under tow (always when high up near the end of the tow, to provide ample recovery altitude).

The goal was to experience the link failure event enough times under training to get students used to the sudden jerk, prevent the instinctual tensing up, and ending up in PIOs (pilot-induced oscillations).

The owner, who was also the tug pilot, didn't like the sudden jerk he would experience when this was done, and after much resistance on my part, he simply forbade me from doing the practical part of the weak link failure training.

The result was that my very next student was inexperienced in this scenario, and when the weak link broke during his very first solo flight, he ended up overcontrolling the glider into the trees.

He was ok, just had minor bruises and scuffs.

My initial elation quickly turned into anger as this could have ended way worse. And if I were only allowed to train this guy to begin with, this clearly could have been avoided. So I went back to the owner expecting that now, surely he would see the sense in resuming the practical weak-link failure training. 

He said no. 

He said the cost of fuel was too great to waste a hundred or so feet of altitude on weak link training.

I called my previous job manager and they were still hiring my replacement. I quit what was my dream job on the spot and went back to my old job.

Unfortunately that's not where the story ends.

The person who replaced me at the flight park, died the following season, along with the passenger he was with. And I'm very sad to say, it was in part because I wasn't there to do anything about... maybe at least channelling the cost-cutting, which continued after my departure. Maybe I would have been able to negotiate where the costs could be cut in a safer manner.

While I was still at the park, before I had quit, I noticed that the tandem glider was starting to show signs of over-UV. To explain, modern hang gliders are built tough - they are certified for at least 6 G's of force, and can do amazing aerial feats (current world record for consecutive loops is 95 in a row, greatest single-flight distance is 764 Km or 475 miles, etc). 

They can clearly take a lot of beating, but the one thing that damages them is solar radiation. A sail on a hang glider can only take so much UV before it degrades past its certification point.

And so, when I noticed that the tandem glider sail was getting past its prime, I brought it up with the owner.

He said no bueno, but assured me that he would look into it at the end of the season when there was more cash in the bank. 

The sail was faded but I felt I was still ok to fly it at the time, so I didn't press it further. As long as the sail was to be replaced as promised, everything would be ok.

As it happened, I had quit before the end of the season, and the guy who got my job didn't know anything about this.

Halfway through the following season, the sail blew open while under tow, and the glider crashed, killing the instructor and the student.

The instructor deployed the emergency parachute (on hang gliders, the chute is designed to bring both people and the aircraft down under one canopy), but they were too low for this. After the scene investigation, it was determined that the chute was deployed roughly at treetop height, which is way too low for the chute to deploy safely.

If I hadn't quit for the reasons I did, maybe I would have quit later due to the sail not being airworthy, or maybe my pressure to replace the sail would have resulted in its replacement. Heck, maybe I would have even caved in to a pressure to continue flying it again - I'm not sure. But as it is now, two people are dead and the school had to close down.

The owner was never sued, although my understanding is that the family of the deceased student was discussing it at the time.

**I have 2 weeks to get away from my husband**

&#x200B;

Throwaway account as my husband and In-laws are follow my main. I, 29 F, have been married to my husband, 30 m, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I met in college during our freshman year. We started off as just friends, and got married seven months ago. I've gotten along with his family, but we aren't super close but we're friendly enough. The problem is that Alex has begun to make me incredibly uncomfortable.

Firstly, he's begun to ask me who I'm meeting with, where, what we plan on doing, how long every single time I leave the house without him. At first, I just thought he was being protective and a good partner just in case something happened, but then he started checking my phone after the visits, vetting and researching each of my friends as well.

He also has been pursuing me to link my bank account to his, as he's ""in charge"" of the finances when he was perfectly fine with keeping them separate before. We fight about it almost every day.

Finally, yesterday when he was preparing to go on a work trip for two weeks in California, he demanded I wear a tracker so he could keep and eye on me while he's gone. I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm suffocating and his family who I've spoken to about his worrying behavior just said he's being careful and protective as a good husband should. I need to gather my things together and find a way to be gone before he gets home without tipping him off.

He's always threatened that if he ever found me cheating on him he'd turn in divorce papers the same day. He keeps a filled out copy in his desk. I'm going to submit those the day I leave. But there's so much to do, bergen finding a new place to live, seeing if my job has any transfers available, packing and moving in two weeks. His return flight May 11th, so I need to move quickly. I'm posting here because I don't have any close family, and I can't risk dragging my friends into this as we share the same friends.I just needed a place to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice on the easiest and safest way to do this?

Edit: oh my god you guys are amazing! I never even thought to not use his divorce papers. I'll check for cameras before I start any packing or prepping. I may also shred his divorce papers just in case and look into getting a lawyer for myself. I'm in a no fault divorce state, that much I so remember which will help. I'll update again when I know more. The tracker he wants me to use is a small clip to put on the belt or waistband. I'll wear it unless I'm going or doing something related to me leaving. No pets yet thankfully.

*Do not take his divorce papers to submit! Who knows what agreements or stipulations he put in there! Get a lawyer and do your own ASAP!*

&#x200B;

**aquavenatus**

*First, contact your job and tell them your situation. They might have “an immediate job opening” for you. Second, contact any nearby DV shelters and ask them for assistance with your plans. Last, file a police report so they know what’s going on; and, so your STBX cannot file a missing person’s report for you. Good luck.*

**Update1 - 2 days later**

&#x200B;

So I've gotten a lot of support and helpful advice along with questions I thought I should clarify before I proceed with the update. Some asked why I'd be 'hiding' things from Alex regarding going out and who I'm meeting with. I don't, and I have nothing to hide. However when he begins to then double check everything I tell him with the other people there right down to each person I talked to and what I said. Did I send any text msgs, did I order food, how much did I eat, that's when it started to feel like I was slowly being pushed into a corner. It didn't start that bad, but gradually grew worse overtime.

All of the Reddit subs my in-law's families are part of are related gardening and diy so I highly doubt they'll see this, if so by the time they do, I'll hopefully be gone. I talked to my job and explained things to my manager. And they promised to look into openings in other states to see if they could get me into one. They'll have an update on that in three days. I trust that my bank account us secured, considering he's tried to get into it before and failed. I found one camera in the kitchen, another in the living room and one in our bedroom. As such, I've left them in place for now and done all other planning, either in the bathroom pretending I'm taking a bath.

I'm honestly staying away from the domestic violence services as my sister-in-law is unfortunately higher up in those considering she volunteers there and I have a feeling if I did show up there, they would know in a heartbeat. I can't look for apartments until I get the update from my work, but either or i'm still gonna be leaving the state. The day before I do I will be changing my number carrier and wiping my laptop and all of his electronics before I do.

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him.

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job.

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time.

*Forget the hidden cameras! The clauses he had written into the divorce papers are extremely troubling. God Forbid you did sign those papers, I don’t believe for a moment that your STBX would have found a way to get you pregnant, with or without your consent.*

*I know you’re pretending you didn’t find the cameras, but I would change clothes either in the bathroom or in the closet. This way he can’t threaten you with naked photos of you later on. Also, make sure all of your essential documents are on you just in case you leave quicker than you planned on leaving.*

*I hope you hear back on the new location by tomorrow. The sooner the better.*

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL to show me his favorite recipes.

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm.

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind.

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in.

*Rather than killing the power breaker unplugging the WiFi router/modem would be sufficient. Small cameras like that are wireless with possibly an sd card backup but they’re not hard wired to the internet and the internet being down is easier to pull off than the power being out since most power companies have live outage maps*

&#x200B;

**zoeheriot**

*As someone who has done this, I have to applaud you for having the courage to do it. I left my shite husband in 2017 when an opportunity opened up in my company to go from Georgia to Arizona. I secretly packed everything I owned and brought it to my office to store until my move. Then I scheduled my direct deposit to shift to my new bank account, and made all the other changes to separate us. Seven years on, it remains the very best decision I've ever made. I hope everything goes smoothly for you!*

&#x200B;

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left.

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through.

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this.

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.

**Update 4 - 7 days later**

&#x200B;

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him.

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex.

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess.

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.

*Yikes the fact that he blew a fuse and started destroying things really is a red flag I'm glad you left before he would've ever snapped and ended up hurting you. I hope your life gets better from here on OP you deserve it good luck!*

**Update - 12 days later**

&#x200B;

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change.

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in.

The responses I got from the emails varied. His family said I was overreacting, and that I owe Alex an apology for the problems this has caused him. The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild. As much as I want to say I was surprised by the lack of support, I’m honestly not.

He intends to fight the divorce. I am letting my lawyer handle it, and I am also pursuing a protective order as well. Once I got approved for my apartment, I also froze my credit. I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA.

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage.

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water.

*Glad to her you're doing well and safely away from him. If you didn't mention it to the alleged friend group, I would send a follow-up that Alex threatened you with divorce regularly, and had a filled-out set of divorce papers as a prop. He valued your marriage so little that he used the threat of ending your marriage as a tool to micromanage your personal behavior, you have taken that lever away.*

*As far as his alleged reasons for wanting to keep close tabs on you, it's common for cheaters to accuse their partner of the same. So get an STD test, you have no idea who or what he has been doing on his business trips.*

&#x200B;

**driftwood-and-waves**

*Replying just gives more fuel for Alex. Anything OP says, even to the friends will get back to him. He will twist it and use it for his benefit.*

*Not replying will piss him off because she's not giving him any control. He can't use what she says against her or gauge where she is emotionally etc so he can plan his next step. Not replying, not reacting, not giving any more information to anyone associated with him, or anyone except her lawyer just to be safe, and having all communication go through her lawyer will make him seeth. By staying silent, and healing and doing better she is winning.*

*But I hella agree with getting tested for all the things. Go get blessed by a holy person or sage yourself and your things just to get all the ick out.*

**Update - 1 month later**

&#x200B;

It’s been a month since my previous update, and I wanted to share some of what’s been going on in the meantime. The divorce is proceeding, but even though I don’t need him to agree – and he’s not – it means I have to go through the courts to get it approved. As such, it could be upwards of six months to push it through even though I’m filing without attempting to claim property, alimony or compensation. I just want a clean break and separation.

Alex has attempted to use our friends to reach out to me, as he doesn’t want to use my lawyer for communication. He’s saying its disrespectful and cowardly to hide behind my lawyer and not meet him face to face. Alex wrote me a letter that he did pass off to my lawyer, but the contents were him justifying his actions and claiming that in today's time it is dangerous for women to be on their own which is why he was so intent on trying to keep me safe from harm. He wanted me to understand that he was trying to protect me as best he could and was hurt that I would just lie to him and hide my actions from him related to my dissatisfaction with our marriage and my moving.

I didn’t reply, because at no point did he apologize. All he did was turn everything around on me as I was being overly dramatic, emotional and cowardly. There was a second letter with Alex’s from my SIL. Her letter… was honestly disturbing and completely justified my misgivings regarding approaching her in any kind of professional capacity. She spent five paragraphs detailing how a ‘real abusive’ relationship looked like and that Alex was the furthest thing from abusive. The details she included were all related to financial abuse and physical abuse. Nothing like what Alex had been doing. She stated that my attempts to smear her brother’s name for attention and clout made me the abuser not him.

I haven’t really been able to process that admittedly. Part of me can’t help but wonder if she’s right. I mean, I blindsided him by leaving as I did and am refusing to speak with him at all. My old boss recommended that I look into getting into therapy after I moved, and I think I need to. I have had a hard time adjusting to being on my own, I keep censoring myself and haven’t even gone out to eat yet. I always end up worrying about what if someone sees me, what if I get in trouble for spending my money on something frivolous…

My lawyer is continuing to fight for the divorce, and I shouldn’t need to be physically present in court. Any meetings needed between me and the judge can be done via zoom. I’m trying to avoid confrontation with Alex and his family for now as much as I can and passed both letters to my lawyer in case he needs them. Our friends are mostly trying to avoid taking sides still, and I’m honestly approaching the point of just letting them go as well. I’m tired of fighting for them to understand at this point. I don’t know if anything is going to happen, so my next update may not be until around mid-November depending on how long it takes to push the divorce through. Work is going well, and it’s helpful to have something familiar to anchor my day to day life when so much has changed and is changing even now.

*Oh yeah, demanding to be charge of all of the money, having divorce papers always filled out, setting up 3 cameras in your home, and demanding you wear a tracking device is all evidence of a nice, normal, healthy relationship. JFC. Your exSIL is such an A H. Don’t for one second take anything she said seriously. And your ex, just trying to “protect you as best he could”. BARF.*

*You should be so proud of yourself for getting away from these lunatics. The road ahead may still be bumpy at times and it’ll take more time for your nerves to settle but you did it. Seek out a therapist still because it’s certainly a lot for one person to process all on their own.*

**New Update**

&#x200B;

**Divorce Proceeding Update**

&#x200B;

It’s been a while since I last updated, as I needed to let the court step in as Alex was not willing to grant my request for a divorce. We started with mediated session via zoom, but after four sessions it was decided that no compromise could be reached between us. The things Alex was pushing for were one’s I’m not even willing to humor let alone agree to. He wanted me to tell our friends and those I’d sent the information to about his actions that I’d made it up in order to gain sympathy. He also wanted me to pay him for defamation and suffering, especially the wages he lost because of sitting in jail for two days and missing work before getting bailed out. Lastly, he also wanted me to return and to quote him ‘stop my foolish behavior and act like a proper wife and partner.’

Yeah no.

So, needless to say, our ‘mediated’ sessions went absolutely nowhere. The judge isn’t seeming to buy into Alex’s act thankfully, because he’s certainly tried. It took me far too long to see Alex for who he was, and part of me feels like an idiot because I didn’t see it at all. Yet, the judge seemed to clock him for exactly what he is within the first meeting. Maybe I just didn’t want to see it. I don’t know. Alex ended up arguing with the Judge a LOT, even being held in contempt four different times. I think it's honestly why this moved as quick as it did. It didn't help that Alex tried to pull in his family as character witnesses but they were dismissed by the Judge as the 'abuse wasn't seen or heard by them, and as such, they only knew part of Alex's character.' In his closing statement after he approved the divorce, he went on to call Alex a narcissist and that if Alex loved himself so much to abuse the one he'd married to let the divorce happen and marry a mirror next. I didn't think a Judge was allowed to say that. At all. But my lawyer just shook his head and told me not to say anything so we left.

So here’s the update I’m sure everyone’s been hoping for and guessed: I’m officially divorced. The documents were processed three days ago, and I’m still in disbelief. I have no contact with Alex any longer, nor do I want any. I’m not going to give our friends my new contact information. I may not have replied to everyone, though I tried, but I did read all of your comments. I really did. Your repeated statements about how they weren’t actually friends really helped me see that they weren’t. So, I decided that since I moved far from that place, I needed to start over. New home, new place, new friends. It’s slow, and I’ve started therapy though it took almost three months to get it due to the usual wait times but I’ve been going three times a week ever since. It’s helping, even with things I thought were done and dusted.

Alex didn’t take the divorce well according to my lawyer who’s been keeping up with him to make sure he stays away from me. He did something at work, I don’t know what as obviously I have no way to gain that information, but whatever it was cost him his job. My lawyer also did something I didn’t expect him to, but something I think everyone will like – He took the letter my ex-sil sent me and forwarded it to the domestic violence organization she works for along with an formal statement regarding Alex, his actions, and the decision of the Judge. She’s been let go as well, and given how tight those organizations are with one another, my lawyer said that the likely hood of her getting a position at another is slim to none. I actually laughed, though I was a bit teary, when he said that and that ‘slim is on a leaky rowboat to China.’

I’ve been crying a lot lately, but my therapist says it’s normal and shows I’m actually processing things instead of bottling them up and pushing them down. I’ll try to update in a month or so, if my emotions level out some, to explain a few more of the details but I wanted to get this out there, and thank everyone for their continued support and encouragement. I appreciate each and every one of you. I really do. You gave me the hope that leaving him wasn’t going to be this giant black mark I’d never heal from or move on from. Work is going well, and the sense of normality and routine is helping me avoid feeling like everything has been spiraling out of control.

*Congratulations, OP! You're free! Now it's time for you to heal. I wish good things to come for you and that you settle into your new life well.*

>OOP: Thank you, part of me feels like I should notice healing, but while my therapist says it's happening, I don't see it. Not yet anyway. Hopefully soon I will.

&#x200B;

**PanicConsistent9656**

*Not to sound like a broken record, but I will say... healing takes time. It's also not linear. You could be fine one day and a total mess the next, but it just goes to show how much you've been keeping in this whole time. At least now, you get to actually process your emotions instead of burying them and be made to feel like you're the bad guy for even feeling those emotions.*

*Stay strong, OP!*

**I have 2 weeks to get away from my husband**

&#x200B;

Throwaway account as my husband and In-laws are follow my main. I, 29 F, have been married to my husband, 30 m, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I met in college during our freshman year. We started off as just friends, and got married seven months ago. I've gotten along with his family, but we aren't super close but we're friendly enough. The problem is that Alex has begun to make me incredibly uncomfortable.

Firstly, he's begun to ask me who I'm meeting with, where, what we plan on doing, how long every single time I leave the house without him. At first, I just thought he was being protective and a good partner just in case something happened, but then he started checking my phone after the visits, vetting and researching each of my friends as well.

He also has been pursuing me to link my bank account to his, as he's ""in charge"" of the finances when he was perfectly fine with keeping them separate before. We fight about it almost every day.

Finally, yesterday when he was preparing to go on a work trip for two weeks in California, he demanded I wear a tracker so he could keep and eye on me while he's gone. I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm suffocating and his family who I've spoken to about his worrying behavior just said he's being careful and protective as a good husband should. I need to gather my things together and find a way to be gone before he gets home without tipping him off.

He's always threatened that if he ever found me cheating on him he'd turn in divorce papers the same day. He keeps a filled out copy in his desk. I'm going to submit those the day I leave. But there's so much to do, bergen finding a new place to live, seeing if my job has any transfers available, packing and moving in two weeks. His return flight May 11th, so I need to move quickly. I'm posting here because I don't have any close family, and I can't risk dragging my friends into this as we share the same friends.I just needed a place to vent, and ask if anyone has any advice on the easiest and safest way to do this?

Edit: oh my god you guys are amazing! I never even thought to not use his divorce papers. I'll check for cameras before I start any packing or prepping. I may also shred his divorce papers just in case and look into getting a lawyer for myself. I'm in a no fault divorce state, that much I so remember which will help. I'll update again when I know more. The tracker he wants me to use is a small clip to put on the belt or waistband. I'll wear it unless I'm going or doing something related to me leaving. No pets yet thankfully.

*Do not take his divorce papers to submit! Who knows what agreements or stipulations he put in there! Get a lawyer and do your own ASAP!*

&#x200B;

**aquavenatus**

*First, contact your job and tell them your situation. They might have “an immediate job opening” for you. Second, contact any nearby DV shelters and ask them for assistance with your plans. Last, file a police report so they know what’s going on; and, so your STBX cannot file a missing person’s report for you. Good luck.*

**Update1 - 2 days later**

&#x200B;

So I've gotten a lot of support and helpful advice along with questions I thought I should clarify before I proceed with the update. Some asked why I'd be 'hiding' things from Alex regarding going out and who I'm meeting with. I don't, and I have nothing to hide. However when he begins to then double check everything I tell him with the other people there right down to each person I talked to and what I said. Did I send any text msgs, did I order food, how much did I eat, that's when it started to feel like I was slowly being pushed into a corner. It didn't start that bad, but gradually grew worse overtime.

All of the Reddit subs my in-law's families are part of are related gardening and diy so I highly doubt they'll see this, if so by the time they do, I'll hopefully be gone. I talked to my job and explained things to my manager. And they promised to look into openings in other states to see if they could get me into one. They'll have an update on that in three days. I trust that my bank account us secured, considering he's tried to get into it before and failed. I found one camera in the kitchen, another in the living room and one in our bedroom. As such, I've left them in place for now and done all other planning, either in the bathroom pretending I'm taking a bath.

I'm honestly staying away from the domestic violence services as my sister-in-law is unfortunately higher up in those considering she volunteers there and I have a feeling if I did show up there, they would know in a heartbeat. I can't look for apartments until I get the update from my work, but either or i'm still gonna be leaving the state. The day before I do I will be changing my number carrier and wiping my laptop and all of his electronics before I do.

I've met with 2 lawyers so far and had them look over the paperwork. My husband had prepared and both said that it did it have some clauses in it. That could have caused me some trouble down the line. What alarmed all of us close the fact that several of those clauses dealt with future children, and not as a hypothetical. Like several hair suggested I have a feeling he fully intended on getting me pregnant to keep me trapped and tied to him.

There are 3 other locations. My job could send me to and I have. As a precaution Begun looking into all 3 cities and housing in the areas. Just in case one of those, this is the one they send me to. Even if they don't have an opening that they can push me into then I will just have to quit, move and figure things out on my own. I have enough money to live and survive for a few months until I can pick up another job.

Unfortunately all of our friends are mutuals and would likely be unaware of the consequences of saying or sharing anything I do or say with my husband. I don't have any surviving close family and obviously my in laws are not a good resource to rely on. I am on my own unfortunately, other than the wonderful bonds, i've begun to make here. I will update again if I get more information or something else happens. Otherwise all update when my work gets back to me. I do plan on leaving before he returns, though. Just to make sure that i'm not anywhere near here at that time.

*Forget the hidden cameras! The clauses he had written into the divorce papers are extremely troubling. God Forbid you did sign those papers, I don’t believe for a moment that your STBX would have found a way to get you pregnant, with or without your consent.*

*I know you’re pretending you didn’t find the cameras, but I would change clothes either in the bathroom or in the closet. This way he can’t threaten you with naked photos of you later on. Also, make sure all of your essential documents are on you just in case you leave quicker than you planned on leaving.*

*I hope you hear back on the new location by tomorrow. The sooner the better.*

&#x200B;

Good news! My work has an opening I qualify for that will not only shift me across the country, but also comes with a salary increase as well. I've started telling my in laws and friends that I'm planning a surprise outing for when my husband gets back for just the two of us. This way, people don't give me odd looks if they see me out and about. I've even gone as far as asking MIL to show me his favorite recipes.

Meanwhile, I've found a moving company that while small is willing to work in a storm. The reason is in five days, we're supposed to get hit with a large storm front. I plan to shut off the breaker and say we lost power if he asks just as several people here suggested and even send him a short clip of the storm.

I will have all of my stuff moved that afternoon, and I will be flying out once the weather has cleared enough to do so. I have a lawyer who will push my divorce through, and I've filled out the necessary paperwork so that I don't have to be here for it. I'm not suing for assets or alimony and I've shredded his divorce papers as well. I've set up a cheap payphone plan through cricket until this is all said and done at which point I will find a new carrier, number and phone. This one is being wiped and left behind.

My laptop is provided by my work, and the IT department inspected it thoroughly and it was clean thankfully. No other electronic aside from my laptop and new phone will be coming with me. If alex needs to talk to me, he can do it through my lawyer. Not sure if anything else will happen, my fingers are crossed that he doesn't think anythings amiss until after I leave - and I'm not turning the breaker back on when I do. He can when he gets home. My work is covering the plane ticket, so that at least is one expense I don't have to finagle in.

*Rather than killing the power breaker unplugging the WiFi router/modem would be sufficient. Small cameras like that are wireless with possibly an sd card backup but they’re not hard wired to the internet and the internet being down is easier to pull off than the power being out since most power companies have live outage maps*

&#x200B;

**zoeheriot**

*As someone who has done this, I have to applaud you for having the courage to do it. I left my shite husband in 2017 when an opportunity opened up in my company to go from Georgia to Arizona. I secretly packed everything I owned and brought it to my office to store until my move. Then I scheduled my direct deposit to shift to my new bank account, and made all the other changes to separate us. Seven years on, it remains the very best decision I've ever made. I hope everything goes smoothly for you!*

**Update3 - 7 days later**

&#x200B;

It's been a busy week, but I've gotten so much done. Firstly, I am now out of the house and am currently in a hotel while I look for an apartment. It's a big city, bustling with people no matter where you look. We had a pretty bad storm system hit back home, that actually lasted two days. High winds, thunder, lightning and even hail everywhere. I didn't take much from the house, my documents, clothes and important sentimental items. I left all of the furniture and electronics behind. I cleaned the house top to bottom and took pictures on my phone so he couldn't claim I damaged anything when I left.

My lawyer has already started divorce proceedings, and my husband will be served on the 8th. His plane is due to land early morning, and the sheriff will be there at the house waiting for him. He is very much about public appearances and reputation. My lawyer will be calling him as well to inform him that I am more than willing to air out everything to the public about his actions if it means securing my freedom from him. I will go to court as long as I must to get this pushed through.

I haven't told our friends or his in-laws yet, I will do that while he is on the flight to prevent him from getting wind of it before he's handed the divorce papers. I will be calling around and explaining why we're getting divorced, to try and prevent him from twisting this into somehow being my fault. I don't want him trying to claim I had an affair or something so I want to get the truth out before he can twist this.

I'm... doing okay. I'm tired, but yet I feel almost jittery and off-kilter. I keep looking over my shoulder and monitoring what I say even when I don't really need to anymore. Hopefully that will fade soon. My work is covering the cost of the hotel, and I'm working on getting my other things in order. I also need to find a new GP as I want to get a full test just to make sure everything is okay. I don't know when my next update will be, probably when the divorce papers are filed or if we have to go to court to push them through. I will try to keep my head up, but it feels like I'm in a whirlwind or something with so many things to do and think about. I kinda thought it would be easier once I got out of the house but while the fear is smaller, somehow the number of tasks only seems to have grown.

&#x200B;

**Update 4 - 7 days later**

&#x200B;

Sorry I haven't updated for a while, things got hectic and a bit chaotic honestly. Firstly, I'm working on getting an apartment still and have applications in at three different places and will hopefully hear back from them soon. I'm still going into work here at the new location, so I don't have to worry about burning through my emergency savings completely. I've gotten a lot of emails from Alex, his family and our old friend group asking question after question. I have only sent one return email to Alex, explaining that I don't believe we are truly compatible, and it is best we separate now. That his treatment of me when I'd done nothing to deserve as such was just as much of a deal breaker as cheating was for him.

I ended the email with the statement that I would not be contacting him further and anything else he needed to pass on to me or vice versa would be done through my lawyer. For his family and friends, I just typed up one email outlining everything that had happened and why I left. I told them I wished them no ill will, but that such treatment of his wife and partner was not acceptable. That should Alex get remarried in the future, I wished they would help support both partners and not just Alex.

Alex, from what my lawyer told me, was livid when he was served. The sheriff actually ended up booking him for assault on an officer and menacing due to the threats he was shouting. His father bailed him out in a few hours, but with the testimony of the sheriff, my lawyer believes I have a very good chance at getting a restraining order. Alex, upon returning to the house, apparently lost his temper again, breaking the dining table into pieces as well as the tv, and putting several holes in the walls. At least that's what one of the emails from one of our friends reported as Alex called him to help him clean up the mess.

My lawyer already has pictures of the house I took, with timestamps as evidence nothing had been damaged by me. My friend reported that Alex tried to claim I'd been the one to trash the house but the holes in the wall were at head height - Alex is 6'3"", and I'm 5'4"" so he knew that was false. Either way, taking the pictures definitely will help me so again thank you everyone here for the advice because I never would have thought of that on my own. My work won't share details of where I am, as I do work with some higher end clientele who value security and that information won't be gossiped about and no, I'm not some stripper or escort. I deal with contracts, notary and business management. As such, even if Alex tried to use my work to find me, he wouldn't succeed.

*Yikes the fact that he blew a fuse and started destroying things really is a red flag I'm glad you left before he would've ever snapped and ended up hurting you. I hope your life gets better from here on OP you deserve it good luck!*

**Update - 12 days later**

&#x200B;

It’s been a little bit, and I thought I’d answer some questions before giving my update. It may be a while after this until things change.

Firstly, No I didn’t bring my car. The public transport here is good enough to use without needing one. I have secured an apartment, and the building has good security. You need a key card to enter, and there is a security guard at a desk right by the entrance to the building. As part of my contract, I gave them a photo of Alex and his family so that even in the off chance they do find me, they won’t be let in.

The responses I got from the emails varied. His family said I was overreacting, and that I owe Alex an apology for the problems this has caused him. The pending criminal charges puts him at risk of losing his job if he’s convicted. Alex sent a long email, apologizing and pleading for me to come home. He said he was worried for me, that he is willing to go to therapy if it will appease me. He wants us to remain together, and he didn’t think leaving was an appropriate response to his genuine concern and worry for my health and safety. The friends gave somewhat lacking replies, saying that they didn’t think Alex was ever going to hurt me and that I shouldn’t be letting my imagination run away wild. As much as I want to say I was surprised by the lack of support, I’m honestly not.

He intends to fight the divorce. I am letting my lawyer handle it, and I am also pursuing a protective order as well. Once I got approved for my apartment, I also froze my credit. I’ve changed my phone carrier and number, as well as making sure none of my documents list Alex as next of kin or POA.

Some have asked why I was so paranoid about Alex and his possible future actions. The answer for that actually is somewhat simple – my grandmother. I loved that woman to bits. As a teen, she explained why my grandfather was never around. He was extremely abusive and manipulative, and her generation didn’t allow divorce really. She wouldn’t have been able to buy a house or get a good enough job to support her and my mother on her own. As such, she endured it, shielded my mom as she could until my grandfather died. When I felt like I may have been overreacting, I remembered how she’d said she’d always wished she’d been able to see grandfather for what he was early on when she may have been able to annul the marriage.

I don’t know when I’ll update again, maybe when the divorce goes through or if something big happens but until then, I’m just trying to keep my head above the water.

*Glad to her you're doing well and safely away from him. If you didn't mention it to the alleged friend group, I would send a follow-up that Alex threatened you with divorce regularly, and had a filled-out set of divorce papers as a prop. He valued your marriage so little that he used the threat of ending your marriage as a tool to micromanage your personal behavior, you have taken that lever away.*

*As far as his alleged reasons for wanting to keep close tabs on you, it's common for cheaters to accuse their partner of the same. So get an STD test, you have no idea who or what he has been doing on his business trips.*

&#x200B;

**driftwood-and-waves**

*Replying just gives more fuel for Alex. Anything OP says, even to the friends will get back to him. He will twist it and use it for his benefit.*

*Not replying will piss him off because she's not giving him any control. He can't use what she says against her or gauge where she is emotionally etc so he can plan his next step. Not replying, not reacting, not giving any more information to anyone associated with him, or anyone except her lawyer just to be safe, and having all communication go through her lawyer will make him seeth. By staying silent, and healing and doing better she is winning.*

*But I hella agree with getting tested for all the things. Go get blessed by a holy person or sage yourself and your things just to get all the ick out.*

**Update - 1 month later**

&#x200B;

It’s been a month since my previous update, and I wanted to share some of what’s been going on in the meantime. The divorce is proceeding, but even though I don’t need him to agree – and he’s not – it means I have to go through the courts to get it approved. As such, it could be upwards of six months to push it through even though I’m filing without attempting to claim property, alimony or compensation. I just want a clean break and separation.

Alex has attempted to use our friends to reach out to me, as he doesn’t want to use my lawyer for communication. He’s saying its disrespectful and cowardly to hide behind my lawyer and not meet him face to face. Alex wrote me a letter that he did pass off to my lawyer, but the contents were him justifying his actions and claiming that in today's time it is dangerous for women to be on their own which is why he was so intent on trying to keep me safe from harm. He wanted me to understand that he was trying to protect me as best he could and was hurt that I would just lie to him and hide my actions from him related to my dissatisfaction with our marriage and my moving.

I didn’t reply, because at no point did he apologize. All he did was turn everything around on me as I was being overly dramatic, emotional and cowardly. There was a second letter with Alex’s from my SIL. Her letter… was honestly disturbing and completely justified my misgivings regarding approaching her in any kind of professional capacity. She spent five paragraphs detailing how a ‘real abusive’ relationship looked like and that Alex was the furthest thing from abusive. The details she included were all related to financial abuse and physical abuse. Nothing like what Alex had been doing. She stated that my attempts to smear her brother’s name for attention and clout made me the abuser not him.

I haven’t really been able to process that admittedly. Part of me can’t help but wonder if she’s right. I mean, I blindsided him by leaving as I did and am refusing to speak with him at all. My old boss recommended that I look into getting into therapy after I moved, and I think I need to. I have had a hard time adjusting to being on my own, I keep censoring myself and haven’t even gone out to eat yet. I always end up worrying about what if someone sees me, what if I get in trouble for spending my money on something frivolous…

My lawyer is continuing to fight for the divorce, and I shouldn’t need to be physically present in court. Any meetings needed between me and the judge can be done via zoom. I’m trying to avoid confrontation with Alex and his family for now as much as I can and passed both letters to my lawyer in case he needs them. Our friends are mostly trying to avoid taking sides still, and I’m honestly approaching the point of just letting them go as well. I’m tired of fighting for them to understand at this point. I don’t know if anything is going to happen, so my next update may not be until around mid-November depending on how long it takes to push the divorce through. Work is going well, and it’s helpful to have something familiar to anchor my day to day life when so much has changed and is changing even now.

*Oh yeah, demanding to be charge of all of the money, having divorce papers always filled out, setting up 3 cameras in your home, and demanding you wear a tracking device is all evidence of a nice, normal, healthy relationship. JFC. Your exSIL is such an A H. Don’t for one second take anything she said seriously. And your ex, just trying to “protect you as best he could”. BARF.*

*You should be so proud of yourself for getting away from these lunatics. The road ahead may still be bumpy at times and it’ll take more time for your nerves to settle but you did it. Seek out a therapist still because it’s certainly a lot for one person to process all on their own.*

**New Update**

&#x200B;

**Divorce Proceeding Update**

&#x200B;

It’s been a while since I last updated, as I needed to let the court step in as Alex was not willing to grant my request for a divorce. We started with mediated session via zoom, but after four sessions it was decided that no compromise could be reached between us. The things Alex was pushing for were one’s I’m not even willing to humor let alone agree to. He wanted me to tell our friends and those I’d sent the information to about his actions that I’d made it up in order to gain sympathy. He also wanted me to pay him for defamation and suffering, especially the wages he lost because of sitting in jail for two days and missing work before getting bailed out. Lastly, he also wanted me to return and to quote him ‘stop my foolish behavior and act like a proper wife and partner.’

Yeah no.

So, needless to say, our ‘mediated’ sessions went absolutely nowhere. The judge isn’t seeming to buy into Alex’s act thankfully, because he’s certainly tried. It took me far too long to see Alex for who he was, and part of me feels like an idiot because I didn’t see it at all. Yet, the judge seemed to clock him for exactly what he is within the first meeting. Maybe I just didn’t want to see it. I don’t know. Alex ended up arguing with the Judge a LOT, even being held in contempt four different times. I think it's honestly why this moved as quick as it did. It didn't help that Alex tried to pull in his family as character witnesses but they were dismissed by the Judge as the 'abuse wasn't seen or heard by them, and as such, they only knew part of Alex's character.' In his closing statement after he approved the divorce, he went on to call Alex a narcissist and that if Alex loved himself so much to abuse the one he'd married to let the divorce happen and marry a mirror next. I didn't think a Judge was allowed to say that. At all. But my lawyer just shook his head and told me not to say anything so we left.

So here’s the update I’m sure everyone’s been hoping for and guessed: I’m officially divorced. The documents were processed three days ago, and I’m still in disbelief. I have no contact with Alex any longer, nor do I want any. I’m not going to give our friends my new contact information. I may not have replied to everyone, though I tried, but I did read all of your comments. I really did. Your repeated statements about how they weren’t actually friends really helped me see that they weren’t. So, I decided that since I moved far from that place, I needed to start over. New home, new place, new friends. It’s slow, and I’ve started therapy though it took almost three months to get it due to the usual wait times but I’ve been going three times a week ever since. It’s helping, even with things I thought were done and dusted.

Alex didn’t take the divorce well according to my lawyer who’s been keeping up with him to make sure he stays away from me. He did something at work, I don’t know what as obviously I have no way to gain that information, but whatever it was cost him his job. My lawyer also did something I didn’t expect him to, but something I think everyone will like – He took the letter my ex-sil sent me and forwarded it to the domestic violence organization she works for along with an formal statement regarding Alex, his actions, and the decision of the Judge. She’s been let go as well, and given how tight those organizations are with one another, my lawyer said that the likely hood of her getting a position at another is slim to none. I actually laughed, though I was a bit teary, when he said that and that ‘slim is on a leaky rowboat to China.’

I’ve been crying a lot lately, but my therapist says it’s normal and shows I’m actually processing things instead of bottling them up and pushing them down. I’ll try to update in a month or so, if my emotions level out some, to explain a few more of the details but I wanted to get this out there, and thank everyone for their continued support and encouragement. I appreciate each and every one of you. I really do. You gave me the hope that leaving him wasn’t going to be this giant black mark I’d never heal from or move on from. Work is going well, and the sense of normality and routine is helping me avoid feeling like everything has been spiraling out of control.

*Congratulations, OP! You're free! Now it's time for you to heal. I wish good things to come for you and that you settle into your new life well.*

>OOP: Thank you, part of me feels like I should notice healing, but while my therapist says it's happening, I don't see it. Not yet anyway. Hopefully soon I will.

&#x200B;

**PanicConsistent9656**

*Not to sound like a broken record, but I will say... healing takes time. It's also not linear. You could be fine one day and a total mess the next, but it just goes to show how much you've been keeping in this whole time. At least now, you get to actually process your emotions instead of burying them and be made to feel like you're the bad guy for even feeling those emotions.*

*Stay strong, OP!*

I have a coworker on my team who I work on a lot of projects with, and I think she may be mentally disturbed. She has been targeting me for the past couple of months, and I only caught on a few weeks ago. Basically, she has now has a history of breaking a figurine and leaving it all over my desk, going through my personal papers while I was in the bathroom, going through my coworkers’ and my personal sheets identifying our merit increases, and (yesterday) leaving push pins facing up on my chair in the morning before I came in.

I told my manager about this and she said nothing will probably change but she will document it, anyway. She is a pretty passive manager and does not like getting involved in conflict. She also has a lot going on with her family and health issues, so she is often over-stressed and away from her desk taking calls from doctors/schools/etc.

HR now knows about this problem employee and they claim they are investigating it, and my manager has said many times that she wants this employee fired but she takes no steps to document the employee’s behavior unless I tell her in writing to do so. Do you think it would be best for me to cut my losses, search for a job at another company and take chances elsewhere rather than sticking it out here? What am I supposed to do? This coworker is gradually getting more aggressive.

***Some Comments from users:***

Commenter: Document, document, document, take date stamped pictures of her destruction of your personal items and of the pins in the chair etc. You’ll need it because it sounds like you are going to have to quit and may need the evidence to collect employment or for medical expenses when she really does physically harm you.

Commenter: I don’t think it makes sense to file a police report about this (it risks putting the spotlight on OP’s response instead of focusing on how batshit crazy the coworker’s behavior is), but I would certainly escalate my complaint to HR. Or, if it’s not going to cost you too much political capital, your boss’s boss. This person has lost their damn mind if they think it’s ok to put pushpins on a coworker’s chair.

Commenter: Lawyer here. She’s escalating. No question. She will hurt someone of not stopped. As to why? Could be sociopathy, medication, other physical issues. But ther is something wrong mentally. She needs treatment, not enabling.

**Update** [Post](https://www.askamanager.org/2018/12/update-my-coworker-put-push-pins-on-my-chair.html)**: December 10, 2018 (8 months later)**

I took your advice and was very firm with my manager and the VP about my intolerance for the situation and I also went to HR myself demanding meetings, as per your advice. I was definitely being firm from the beginning but I made it way more obnoxious for them to ignore my concerns, and after several meetings with HR and my manager and the VP of our department, HR and the VP worked out a corrective action plan for the offender. She was not to speak to me or the rest of the team about anything related to the issues she caused and was generally told to not make idle conversation with me at all (since I told HR myself I want as little contact with her as humanly possible). She was also moved to the other side of the floor to sit directly in front of the VP’s office so he could keep an eye on her. She has had many run-ins with HR for leaving an hour or two earlier than she’s supposed to, so they figured this would kill two birds with one stone.

Anyway, another manager in my department (whom is EXTREMELY friendly and kind), lets call her “Jane,” had to work with her on a large high-level project which required them to have lots of meetings and contact with each other every day. After the first few meetings, Jane noticed that the offender was often not at her desk even though her meeting calendar was wide open. Since she was having trouble contacting her, she asked her about how she can get into contact with her when she’s not at her workspace so that they can resolve issues quickly. After that moment, the offender began to show Jane her true colors, as well. Jane started to receive some violent and strange actions from the offender – for example, coming to her enclosed office in the morning to find her chair knife-sliced and things on her desk broken (only other person in the office at that time was the offender), having pictures of her and her family stolen from her desk, and catching the offender in her enclosed office on several occasions with no reason for being there. The offender also continuously broke into my own managers enclosed office to steal the calendar from her wall (which my manager uses to remind her of her employees scheduled PTO).

A few more things occurred with me where the offender would creep into my cubicle when I was not around – however, Jane and another employee would question her every time and she eventually stopped doing that altogether. Often I would come in and all of my electronics (monitor, computer, phone, cell charger, keyboard) would all be unplugged and jerked around to different areas. The timing was always conveniently early in the morning when very few of us are here, but guess who always was one of those few – YOU GUESSED IT – the offender! Eventually, we have all learned to always put everything away and lock them in our drawers, even when we go to the bathroom, and most of us have started to come in 30-60 minutes early just to ensure she doesn’t mess with our things and often we try to make sure at least one person is over in our section at a time so we can guard each other’s things.

We all continued discussing these issues with HR (including the managers and the VP himself several times), especially as the offender recently has been constantly leaving for hours throughout the day AND leaving hours early without receiving approval or even informing anyone (and she has no PTO left), but they refused to fire her. She often found ways to explain things away (covering herself by saying she took a training to help her be a better employee, etc.) She is also a (\*suspected\*) FMLA time off abuser, who has sued previous companies for FMLA discrimination. Purely speculation, but we imagine she was most likely fired from these companies after she kept using unfounded excuses for leaving without approval. (Examples: saying she can’t work certain days of the week because of her “flare-ups” which are always conveniently Wednesday and Friday afternoons, constantly taking time off without having any time in her bank left, etc. just like she does here.) So basically, we got the inkling from the HR reps and their carefully-worded explanations for their inaction that they were expecting the offender may attempt to sue the company and they were trying to avoid it.

Luckily, however, as of THREE days ago, the offender RESIGNED!!!! WOOOO!!!! We are all very happy on this team now that we know the she is almost gone forever!

In the end, we were all extremely disappointed by how unsupportive our HR department is and by how much power HR reps have. The VP should have been able to remove the offender as soon as he felt so inclined with all the evidence of her violent behavior, yet, HR was able to block him every time.

Ultimately though, for now, we can all breathe a little better because she will no longer be able to terrorize us! (Now, if only we could warn her new company….)

You SHOULD Pack-a-Punch ASAP in BO6 (and Cold War),"I've seen people say wait til round 15 or 20 for pap. And round 35-40+ for pap 3. This makes no sense to me. The point system rewards killing in this game. A higher pap gun gets more kills with less ammo. Hence more points and less (sometimes no) trips to the ammo box. You can reasonably rely on special rounds and the drop cycle for ammo until like round 40. You'll also have tens of thousands of points by 35ish plus any streaks, purchased or dropped, will ensure you're still gaining points on top of your bank. You'd still make points at round 35 with 10k worth of ammo box purchases which is not even close to necessary. And by round 50+ if you're going that far, you're no longer using bullet weapons to kill.

Just seems like a huge misconception in this community and even among some prominent voices. I pap asap (round 10ish), even before a first perk sometimes. Then I get 3-4 perks and pap 2(round 15ish), then 5-6 perks and pap 3(round 22ish). All of these as soon as I can afford it. I don't have ammo issues or points issues. I usually have to buy ammo before I pack at all and maybe once in the 30s with bad RNG. Plus I'm stronger so less likely to take a down.

I do want to note that this is based on having extended mags and the headshot barrel on average or above weapons. Deadshot with the double damage augment makes this game ark more even more powerful but isn't needed.

Just seems like a huge misconception in this community and even among some prominent voices. I pap asap (round 10ish), even before a first perk sometimes. Then I get 3-4 perks and pap 2(round 15ish), then 5-6 perks and pap 3(round 22ish). All of these as soon as I can afford it. I don't have ammo issues or points issues. I usually have to buy ammo before I pack at all and maybe once in the 30s with bad RNG. Plus I'm stronger so less likely to take a down.

I do want to note that this is based on having extended mags and the headshot barrel on average or above weapons. Deadshot with the double damage augment makes this game ark more even more powerful but isn't needed.

"From Senator Chris Van Hollen: Urgent Senate Update: Our Government Belongs to the American People, Not Elon Musk","

Urgent Senate Update: Our Government Belongs to the American People, Not Elon Musk

Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen unprecedented and illegal actions from the Trump Administration that are threatening our communities. That’s why I’m sending you another urgent newsletter update, following the one I sent Saturday and last week. I’m also providing constant updates on my social media accounts which you can find here: Bluesky, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Threads, Twitter/X. And you can share with us how Trump/Musk Administration actions are affecting you, by visiting my website here. We’ve already heard from thousands of Marylanders, and your stories will continue to help us fight back.  

We are witnessing the most corrupt bargain in American history. Elon Musk spent over $280 million to elect Donald Trump, and Trump has handed him the keys to the federal government. Together, they’re abusing their power to access sensitive personal information about Americans and to further enrich and empower the ultra-wealthy at the expense of the rest of America.   

Elon Musk is now staging a hostile takeover of virtually the entire federal government. This is no time for business as usual, and I can assure you I am fighting back with every tool at my disposal. One of those essential tools is stopping these illegal actions in the courts, and I’ve spent hours on the phone and in person with lawyers who are assembling and filing the cases to stop this illegal power grab. I am also doing everything I can to rally opposition to the Musk takeover and use the tools of the Senate to oppose Trump nominations and focus on the crisis at hand.   

Last weekend, we learned that Trump and Musk were working to shutter USAID. On Monday, they banned workers from entering USAID offices and doubled down on a foreign aid freeze that prevents patriotic USAID employees from doing essential and life-saving work around the world. Make no mistake: Elon Musk’s effort to dismantle USAID is a gift to China, Russia, and our other adversaries. Putin’s cronies immediately posted on X, “Smart move by Elon Musk.” This is not America First – it is America in Retreat. It has nothing to do with government efficiency and everything to do with aiding and abetting our adversaries. In fact, if you talk to American military leaders, they will tell you that USAID is an essential and cost-effective part of our overall national security and foreign policy strategy. USAID makes us safer by helping provide more stability and opportunity to very combustible parts of the world. And when USAID fights disease overseas, they not only save lives there, they also prevent those diseases from spreading here and harming Americans.  

Shutting down USAID not only makes us less safe – it’s also downright illegal. USAID is established by law. Presidents are not kings, and they don’t get to cherry-pick the law. And Elon Musk may get to be a dictator at Tesla – and he may want to play dictator in the nation’s capital – but he doesn’t get to shred the law.  

On Monday, I organized a group of my colleagues to go to the USAID Headquarters to stand with current and former employees against this illegal power grab. I was joined by over a dozen Senate and House members, and we attempted to go inside USAID to see first-hand what was taking place. We were barred from entering because of orders given by Musk and his cronies. When the Administration continued to double down on these actions, I joined even more current and former USAID employees on Wednesday, to speak out once again, and yesterday I made the case on the Senate floor.

What we’re seeing at USAID isn’t just a battle over providing critical foreign assistance to advance American interests and values across the globe – it’s also a test case for many of their other illegal efforts to take over our government. And just yesterday, we learned that Elon Musk and his cronies are planning to fire nearly all of USAID's 13,000 employees. Last night the American Foreign Service Association, American Federation of Federal Government Employees, and the nonprofit Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit to stop this cruel, lawless attack, and I am doing everything I can to support them. 

USAID is not the only place we’re witnessing Musk’s takeover efforts this week. We also learned that Trump has handed Elon Musk access to Americans’ personal, private data – ranging from your Social Security number to your bank account information. By providing Musk and his cronies access to the Treasury Department, he’s putting the confidential information of millions of Americans at risk.   

These systems are so sensitive that they are entrusted to the smallest possible circle of nonpartisan civil servants. Now, they’re in the hands of Elon Musk, an unelected billionaire, and his DOGE minions. While a court just restricted their use of this sensitive information, they can still do enormous harm to the privacy and other important interests of the American people.

To protest this unacceptable breach of Americans’ trust, on Tuesday, we rallied outside the Department of Treasury and called out the Trump Administration for giving away Americans’ most sensitive information. I am also using Senate hearings to raise the alarm about what is happening. On Wednesday, I asked bank executives at our Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing if they would ever allow access to this type of information at their institutions, and they said ""no.” I also called on the Chair of the Committee to immediately hold hearings about this unacceptable breach of American privacy.

Unfortunately, USAID and Treasury are not alone. We’re hearing reports of many other agencies being raided by DOGE, including NOAA and the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services in Maryland, as well as efforts to completely hollow out the Department of Education and the Office of Personnel Management, which oversees more than two million federal employees. I’ll continue to speak out against each of these illegal efforts – for example, I joined a rally with teachers, education advocates, and others on Tuesday to stand up for our students and our public education system.  

We must stop this illegal power grab.  

Right now, our best recourse for immediate relief is through the courts. I’m grateful for the states, the federal workers’ unions, the nonprofits, and the democracy watchdogs who are suing Donald Trump for his illegal actions, and I’m engaging with these groups and doing everything in my power to support their efforts. We’ve already seen some courts put a stop to these illegal actions. The situation is evolving every day, but here’s the latest. Two cases filed against Trump’s funding freezes have resulted in temporary restraining orders against these actions. Another court blocked Trump’s attack on birthright citizenship. Additionally, a judge partially reined in Musk’s access to records at the Treasury Department, and yesterday a judge delayed his sketchy buyout offers for federal employees and will hold a hearing on Monday to review its status. To federal workers considering these buyouts, I once again urge you to proceed with extreme caution.

Baltimore City has also joined a coalition in a lawsuit against the Administration’s witch hunt against so-called “DEI” initiatives – an order so broad and undefined that it could freeze funding for everything from afterschool programs for kids to public safety. Federal employees have been put on leave and encouraged to report on their colleagues over “DEI,” including in one case for attending a training conducted during the last Trump Administration that was promoted by his former Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos.   

I’m heartened by the actions our courts have taken so far, and I’ll continue working closely to support these efforts. 

And while we’re not in the majority, I am also determined to fight back in the Senate with every tool we have. Without Republicans on board, we don’t have the numbers to stop Trump’s moves outright, but we can slow him down. That’s why I have said the Senate should NOT operate under business as usual. And that’s why I’m voting NO on Trump’s nominees. Along with Senator Brian Schatz, I’m holding up every Trump political nominee for the State Department – as well as other nominees – until Trump stops wrecking our government.  

For example, this week Senate Democrats held down the floor for 30 hours – the maximum time allowed under Senate rules – to delay the vote on Russell Vought, Trump’s nominee to run the Office of Management and Budget. I went to the Senate floor as part of this effort to make the case against Vought, who is a leading architect of Project 2025. At his confirmation hearing, I asked Vought if he’d follow the law—and he refused to say yes. That should be no surprise; he broke the law the last time he held that position.

Right now, I’m hearing from thousands of Marylanders who have been personally affected by Trump’s actions. Firefighters and small business owners who fear that federal resources will be ripped out from under them. Federal workers who fear being forced out of their jobs. Families terrified of losing their health care. I’m committed to fighting back for Marylanders each and every day. Again, if you are being harmed by Trump’s actions, you can share your story with me by clicking here.  

Trump and Musk are engaged in an illegal power grab, trying to accomplish through executive orders and other means what can only be legally achieved through congressional action. They want us to believe they are more powerful than they really are. They want us to think we can’t do anything about it. But it isn’t true. Together, we can and will keep fighting back.

WSJ: “Young Wall Street bankers say they have a drug problem with ADHD pills”,"
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡

Many Wall Street bankers use Adderall and Vyvanse as tools to plow through long hours of tedious work amid high-pressure competition.

[https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/young-banker-finance-adhd-medication-adderall-d578a16f](https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/young-banker-finance-adhd-medication-adderall-d578a16f)

As Mark Moran was facing another 90-hour week as an investment-banking intern at Credit Suisse in New York, he knew he needed help to survive the rest of the summer. His colleagues gave him a tip: Visit a Wall Street health clinic and tell the staff he had trouble focusing.

Ahead of his first appointment, he filled out a five-minute questionnaire. One of the questions asked if he had trouble staying organized, another, if he procrastinated. He then met with a clinician who said his answers suggested he had attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. He left with a prescription for Adderall.

No matter that a family member, a psychologist, didn’t think Moran had ADHD. He found that when he took Adderall, he could keep working for hours, and was able to actually be interested in some of the mundane tasks required of a young investment banker, such as aligning corporate logos on a PowerPoint or formatting cells in Microsoft Excel. 

He also wanted to show his bosses he was a hard worker and eventually secure a lucrative full-time job offer after finishing graduate school.

“They gave me a script, and within months, I was hooked,” said Moran, now 33 years old and running his own investor-relations firm. He’s also a provocative personality on social media, commenting on finance, politics and culture, including prescription drug use. “You become dependent on it to work.”

Images of Wall Street’s rank-and-file blowing cash on illegal drugs and nightlife are well known, with cocaine a favored drug through the 1980s, as portrayed in “The Wolf of Wall Street.” 

These days, drugs are more a tool to optimize performance on the job. Especially for entry-level bankers at the analyst and associate level—who work long, tedious hours and fiercely compete for higher-level jobs with big pay days—prescriptions for stimulants such as Adderall and other ADHD drugs have become commonplace.  

Jonah Frey, who worked as an investment banker in healthcare for Wells Fargo in San Francisco, said one colleague would sometimes snort lines of crushed up Adderall pills from his desk in the bullpen—the common area where junior bankers sit and work together. “Nobody blinked an eye,” he said.

Others use nicotine pouches such as Zyn to excess, or consume energy drinks. One banker who worked in Houston between 2017 and 2019 described his colleagues drinking “Monsterbombs”—an extra-strength 5-hour Energy shot dropped into a glass filled with Monster Energy, chugged in one go. The caffeine payload was the equivalent of nearly five cups of coffee at once.

The feeling that the jobs can’t be done without stimulants comes as Wall Street is under fire for pushing junior bankers to take on dangerous workloads.

"Noam Chomsky Has Been Proved Right • The writer’s new argument for left-wing foreign policy has earned a mainstream hearing. (Book review ""The Myth of American Idealism"")","For more than half a century, Noam Chomsky has been arguably the world’s most persistent, uncompromising, and intellectually respected critic of contemporary U.S. foreign policy,  seeking to expose Washington’s costly and inhumane approach to the rest of the world, an approach he believes has harmed millions and is contrary to the United States’ professed values. As co-author Nathan J. Robinson writes in the preface, **The Myth of American Idealism** was written to “draw insights from across [Chomsky’s] body of work into a single volume that could introduce people to his central critiques of U.S. foreign policy.” It accomplishes that task admirably.

The central target of the book is the claim that U.S. foreign policy is guided by the lofty ideals of democracy, freedom, the rule of law, human rights, etc. For those who subscribe to this view, the damage the United States has sometimes inflicted on other countries was the unintended and much regretted result of actions taken for noble purposes and with the best of intentions. 

For Chomsky and Robinson, these claims are nonsense. Not only did the young American republic fulfill its Manifest Destiny by waging a genocidal campaign against the indigenous population, but it has since backed a bevy of brutal dictatorships, intervened to thwart democratic processes in many countries, and waged or backed wars that killed millions of people in Indochina, Latin America, and the Middle East, all while falsely claiming to be defending freedom, democracy, human rights, and other cherished ideals. U.S. officials are quick to condemn others when they violate international law, but they refuse to join the International Criminal Court, the Law of the Sea Treaty, and many other global conventions. Nor do they hesitate to violate the United Nations Charter themselves.

The record of hypocrisy recounted by Chomsky and Robinson is sobering and convincing. No open-minded reader could absorb this book and continue to believe the pious rationales that U.S. leaders invoke to justify their bare-knuckled actions.

The book is less persuasive when it tries to explain why U.S. officials act this way.  Chomsky and Robinson argue that U.S. foreign policy is largely the servant of corporate interests—the military-industrial complex, energy companies, and “major corporations, banks, investment firms. The picture is more complicated than they suggest. For starters, when corporate profits and national security interests clash, the former often lose out. Also, other great powers have acted in much the same way, inventing their own elaborate moral justifications. This behavior preceded the emergence of modern corporate capitalism.

Why do Americans tolerate policies that are costly, often unsuccessful, and morally horrendous? Their answer, which is generally persuasive, is twofold.  First, ordinary citizens lack the political mechanisms to shape policy. Second, government institutions work overtime to “manufacture consent” by classifying information, prosecuting leakers, lying to the public, and refusing to be held accountable. [Having written about these phenomena myself](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250234810/thehellofgoodintentions), I found their portrait of how the foreign-policy establishment purveys and defends its world view to be broadly accurate.

Despite some reservations, **The Myth of American Idealism** is a valuable work that provides an able introduction to Chomsky’s thinking. Indeed, if I were asked whether a student would learn more about U.S. foreign policy by reading this book or by reading a collection of the essays that current and former U.S. officials occasionally write in journals such as Foreign Affairs or the Atlantic, Chomsky and Robinson would win hands down.

I wouldn’t have written that last sentence when I began my career 40 years ago. I’ve been paying attention, however, and my thinking has evolved as the evidence has piled up. It is regrettable but revealing that a perspective on U.S. foreign policy once confined to the margins of left-wing discourse in the United States is now more credible than the shopworn platitudes that many senior U.S. officials rely on to defend their actions.

**AITA for refusing to pay my sister’s wedding expenses after she called my child a ""mistake""?** 

**Originally posted to r/AITAH** 

**Thanks to u/queenlegolas & u/ellenessie for suggesting this BoRU** 

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!murder, physical assault, threats, drug use, possible mental health issues, theft!< 

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/bP1qFqcNpn)  **Sept 28, 2024** 

Hi, guys, so I created a profile just for this - I have a main account I use for my art. I don't really know how to post on this sub though, so please excuse any mistakes - also I think it's important to give a TW as this had violence and death involved and I know from personal experience that it can be triggering: 

So, I (F32, Deanna) am the eldest of five siblings, and I’ve taken on the role of the family caretaker for as long as I can remember. I helped our parents until their passing, and, frankly, it’s exhausting. Dad died of brain cancer 3 years ago, and it was heartbreaking to watch him deteriorate over time, and Mom passed peacefully overnight after a long hard battle with breast cancer earlier this year. 

FUCK cancer. 

So as the oldest, I just sort of became the de-facto parent. I don't mind as I love my siblings, and its kind of my thing to ""big sister"" friends and family a lot. I'm sort of ship's counselor, and I financially help out my family. I don't mind, as I work in tech, have a side gig doing art, and inherited land and money from mom and dad- all that to say it's no real loss. 

A few years ago, I adopted my cousin’s ""Charlie"" M45 child who I will just use her nickname ""Decker"" (my baby loves kickboxing) after my cousin went to prison for murdering the Decker's mother in an alcohol and drug-fueled rage - which is too long a story to add here. It was a chaotic year of mourning, paperwork and court hearings, but the adoption was finalized when the Decker was five. Now, she’s a happy, healthy 13-year-old who calls me “Mom.” She’s in therapy, and has been since I legally could send her as she witnessed her mother's death, and I couldn’t be prouder of how resilient she is. She's my girl, my rock-star, my whole heart and I call her that - literally ""My heart"". 

Fast forward to my sister’s, Clara (F30), upcoming wedding. I was thrilled for her at first, and she asked me to be MOH. I cried in joy and offered for my wife ""Honey"" (because we like The Incredible lol) F40 and I to pay for it (don't worry I asked Honey first). 

But during a bachelorette dinner I set up, she made a hurtful comment about my daughter, calling her a “mistake” and saying I “shouldn’t have taken her in.” I stared at her and asked her what she meant and she said it wasn't like I was supposed to even have kids, as I am married to another woman - then said ""no hate or anything"" and laughed but then she doubled down that Decker is likely damaged and a handful. 

Guys, Decker is the SWEETEST child alive. I mean she is a teen so yeah sometimes she can get challenging or rebellious here or there, but when I say she is my WHOLE heart, I mean it. She made us a family, and made our house a home. She smiles easy, cries openly and has the emotional intelligence I WISH I had myself. She always asks ""how are you doing?"" and she really means it, willing to listen to people. But she's a ""damaged"" ""mistake""!? 

I felt like a character in a dark, twisted episode of a sci-fi show—defending my choice to adopt felt like fighting the Borg, like I just wouldn’t assimilate. I didn't laugh it off with my sister and her friends. I just stared at her in pure disbelief. I think she knew I was hurt because she quickly changed the subject. I said I better get home, paid for everything and 3 more rounds and went home to my family. 

My sister came over the next day to yell at me for leaving and ""cutting them off"" after the 3 rounds I paid for. She said I owe her a do-over for ruining the whole weekend because I can't take a joke. Honey, who I of course told what happened, asked my sister to repeat exactly what she said about our daughter. My sister refused, and kept calling Decker ""Charlie's child"" and I just was holding back so many tears.  I told my sister that I wouldn’t be contributing a dime to her wedding expenses - that I won't stop helping her pay her rent up until she moves in with her husband, but I won't be in or pay for the wedding of a person who sees my child as a mistake. 

Honestly, I was ready to go full-on Jedi and sever that connection but Honey helped me temper myself. My sister lost it, threw the can of soda water we gave her at me, screamed ""How am I supposed to pay for this!?"" and I said, ""You have over a year, you can save up."" - so left, showving Honey out of the way in the process and blew up our sibling group chat. My other siblings are split. Some think I’m overreacting with cutting off funds for the wedding, while others agree that my sister crossed a line and needed the wake up call. 

Now, I feel bad for my sister - I do love her and she is distressed by this - but I can’t shake the feeling that standing up for my daughter is more important. AITA for refusing to pay for her wedding after that?

I've been working on my work project at a local brewery and have been silently sobbing in reading the comments. 

Also wow so many comments! I was trying to reply to everyone but I honestly ran out of steam. I sent this post to my wife and also just bracing myself to talk to Decker tonight. We want to ask her of her aunt has done or said anything cruel to or about her. I am wishing hard that shes just confused by our questions and remain oblivious of this shitstorm. 

I love my Heart. I want her to always remain the bright, fun, loving, encouraging person she is. I don't want her to know anything about what her aunt has said.  I texted my sister if she meant this, if she really sees me, my wife, and our daughter that way or was she just drunk and stupid and doubled down in embarrassment. That said, I don't want her near Decker anytime soon. 

I feel so lost. I wasn't planning on ever being a parent and there is no fucking manual for this. What the fuck do I even do?? 

Wish me luck for tonight. I will need it because if Decker tells us her aunt has been cruel to her face, I will have to hold my wife back from swinging on my sister. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/HHznlHkuf3)  **Sept 29, 2024 (Next Day)** 

I am trying to keep this short. 

Honey and I took Decker out to the local Oktoberfest celebrations. She had a blast, did crafts, danced to music, had ""beer"" (it was not beer) in a pint glass, and generally had a great time. 

On the ride home my wife broached the long awaited topic. We asked her how she felt about grandma's passing then went into how everyone handles things differently. We asked if Mama (me) or Mommy (Honey) ever was hurtful and she named a couple moments we've been snappy or wouldn't let her do things (like a party at 2am!? Hm.) But no nothing else. We asked about Clara and she got quiet. Honey just looked at me but I was driving, so I just said ""You can tell us anything, goober, you know that"" and she clammed up. 

I got my girls home and hugged my Heart/Decker and went to the den. About 2 hours later my wife came downstairs to me and said Decker is in bed but no asleep and I should talk to her. I asked why and she simply said that Decker is willing to talk about it. I went up. 

Decker was ready for bed, in her PJs, reading. I just sat down on the side of the bed and asked her how she was. She just said ""Mom told you huh?"" I told her I didn't know anything and Decker then said that Clara makes her uncomfortable and said hurtful things. When my wife and I weren't around, Clara would call her the ""lost puppy"" or ""the stray"" and once Decker remembers her to have told her to her face ""You're not real family"" and that once Honey and I get a ""real child"" we will dump her. 

I can't explain the rage. The absolute, total, and complete red I saw as my daughter broke down telling me that she behaves so well and is so obsessed with grades so she can prove she is worth loving, worth keeping. 

After calling my wife we sat her down and told her that she is the best thing that ever happened to us and that even if we do have more children, she is our firstborn and our love. I cried and held her telling her she was my whole heart and that nothing will ever change that. She saved us, and I am so proud of her and us and all we've grown to become. I can't ever stop loving her. Neither can her Mom. We love her more than air. That will *never* change. 

Then I explained that auntie was wrong for this. Auntie is jealous of her. Jealous of how much we love her. Auntie needs help but we can't give that help so she won't be around for a while. Decker asked us to stop talking to her like a child, so I was blunt. ""She's my sister and I love her. You're my daughter and I love you more."" I told her my sister was wrong and hateful. I'm sorry that she didn't feel she could come to her mom or I.  But she can. Every time. Any time. We will choose her. Always. 

Decker asked me of its her fault I ""hate"" Clara and I just told her hate is a choice and I don't hate Clara. I do love her. But sometimes loving a person means you correct them. Actions have consequences. 

My daughter got quiet and handed me her phone and Clara had been texting her AWFUL things since she left my home. I can't even type them because I want to throw things but it's when I read my fucking sister texting my teenage daughter ""Go tell your so-called mom like a snitch and prove me right"" 

I took a screenshot and texted it to myself. Decker fell asleep around midnight and my wife and I went to bed. I texted my sister the screenshot and said: 

You come into my home as my sister and treat my child like this? 

No. 

Mom and Dad would be ashamed of you. This is not how you treat any child. Let alone your own neice. I have loved you since as long as I can remember. I know you were not raised to treat children so terribly. But as of now, you are not accepted in my home. You will not speak to or contact me, my wife, or my child. 

I will give you the money for October, Clara, but Novermber on? That's your responsibility. I am no longer going to help. I'm sorry. This breaks my heart. But you crossed a serious and unforgivable line. 

Decker is my daughter. I am her mom. Do not doubt me here, and I want to be clear - if you *ever* come sideways at my family again, or contact my daughter at all, I will take legal recourse. 

From today on, we are low contact. If you try to make this into a bigger issue, it will be no contact. If you don't understand, here are resources to help spell it out. 

I love you,
Dee

Update 2: AITA for refusing to pay my sister’s wedding expenses after she called my child a ""mistake""? 

Edit to add the same trigger warnings as before sorry for forgetting - my brain is chaotic - TW: abuse, self harm, substance abuse, death, violence 

I kept my promise to my wife to wait before reacting. She knows me best and knew I was prepared to go nuclear. Turns out, I needn't have bothered. 

Let me clear up a couple of small details and misconceptions I've read. 

1. I am the eldest of the siblings. Mom and Dad have been sick for years on and off. So to those who think I've just started taken over as some weird power trip or something, no. I've managed their finances, maintained their properties, and taken care of all their affairs before either of them passed. Dad simply wasn't mentally able after a while and mom never had a head for that sort of thing. 

2. Yes, I was mostly left in charge of my siblings growing up. Both my parents had businesses and worked often 7 day weeks. I cooked dinner and helped with homework and whatnot. I'm aware that's not very normal, and I already know some of you will call my parents terrible for this but they simply didn't know better. I won't hate them for any of it and as much as it caused me some negative effects, it also made my siblings feel safe. I'm proud of being able to protect them and be there for them when they were young so they didn't feel how I felt. And yes, I am also in therapy. 

3. I was the sole caretaker of my parents when they passed. The reasons are complicated but the short of it is, Dad got verbally abusive towards the end and mom got severely depressed and blunt. They were a challenge to deal with on the best of days. I hold no ill will towards them, but there it is. My siblings didn't want to be around them. Dad was hurt and changed his will. Mom followed suit. 

4. For those telling me I am ""rewarding"" Clara by paying for literally this month, and that I'm not a real mom or a bad mom by loving my daughter's tormentor, I'm envious your world is so black and white. Rent is literally due today and the money was already in transfer to her via auto-banking. And Clara isn't getting rewarded, she is remaining *housed*. But from now on, she's on her own. 

5. Clara and I used to be pretty close but she did get distant around the time Decker was adopted. I didn't know exactly why, just that the new dynamic was a challenge for her. I know she *hates* Charlie and considers him evil and irredeemable. She had a really hard time losing our cousin-in-law, Decker's biological mother, as they were very close so I assume her issues stem from this. 

7. I inherited the majority of everything though my siblings got sizable sums, 3 got all but one of the businesses my parents owned, and everyone got trusts. Clara spiraled after mom passed and had a mental health crisis. Before we got her help, she traveled, drank, and gambled away her entire inheritance. Long story for another time. 

I didn't have a moment to cool down and wait until today to give myself a chance to make a level-headed decision regarding my sister. Clara has spun the tale that I am jealous she found a loving man and am withholding mom and dad's money from her. She gave the perception that I was the one abusing Decker, putting her down, and telling her she isn't my real daughter. That shut down when I sent my text a couple days ago. 

Yesterday, Clara was on my doorstep. She was crying and begging for me to let her in but my wife and her friends were inside and I made it clear I don't want her near my family as she emotionally abused my daughter and physically harmed my wife. I told her to leave or I would call the police to have her removed. I was going to call the police anyway because I told her never to come to our home again and there she was. There's a reason I said this in text, so I could -in an event like this- show them clear as day that she would know she is welcome. 

Clara started to beg saying she will apologize to Decker and she was drunk and upset and made mistakes. I could tell she was drunk. Or high. Or somethkng. I told her it's not a simple ""mistake"" to bully a traumatized teen girl and make her feel unloved and unwanted by her own family and to text her that she is worthless and expendable. What the fuck!? 

I got angry and just started to raise my voice. I dont know when I started to yell but I did. I just...lost it. 

She's a cold-hearted, awful, self-serving brat. Spoiled beyond belief to being so delusional that this all would just go away - that's she's *entitled* to the money my wife and I make, that our parents gave us after all she did. She needs fucking help and I am done being the giving tree here. You don't ever hurt my child. She's lucky I have a head to keep my hands to myself and luckier still Honey isn't out here because she certainly would not so go the fuck home. 

Clara slapped me across the face and called me a bitch and a traitor that I choose that ""demon spawn"" of a child over her. That I love Decker more than my own real family and turn my back on her this way. 

Honey must have been right by the door because before I could make a *very* bad choice she had yanked me inside, told my sister that she had 60 seconds to fuck off and slammed the door closed. 

Clara left quickly but we still called the police and handed over the footage from our property cameras of what happened, as well as the texts from our phones. Clara went ballistic over text telling me awful things ending with her hoping I take my own life and she would celebrate. Absolutely unhinged awful shit like that. I blocked her, sent every piece of footage In a google drive and dropped the link in the sibling group chat and sent it to ""Kevin"" her fiance. 

I then sat down and cried myself into a fit before Decker  came home from practice. I put on my ""mom"" face for her and made sure she did her homework then I went to the den and called my aunt - Decker's biological grandmother - and told her what happened. 

My aunt told me that Clara is renewing her conspiracy that I harming Decker and that I need to be careful because she suspects Clara is having some sort of mental break and might do something crazy. 

Honey and I have spent this whole day working on a request for a protective order from her. Making sure Decker's school knows no one is to pick her up but us. And get a lawyer because I think legal action is needed here. I told my eldest of the brothers that Clara needs help and asked if he could check on her because she might be as much a danger to herself as she is now presenting to be to me and my family. He got quiet and said ""Can't you handle this?"" And said this drama was too much and he's busy. 

I was so stunned I just blurted out ""Are you fucking kidding me right now?"" Before I just hung up. My other sister is now over, helping me deal with this. My other brother has gone to see after Clara, but says he will only make sure she hasn't hurt herself but beyond that she can get wrecked for what she's done. 

Kevin called me and said he went through the Google drive and begged me not to call the police on Clara. He said that she has been having a really bad time, and has struggled with drinking and has been stealing his medications and he's trying to get her help. But if she gets arrested, he doesn't have the funds for bail pr any legal help. I told him it's too late. The police have been called and he needs to get her into some sort of rehab or something. He asked for our help to pay for a facility he was thinking of and I told him to keep her away from me and my family. 

He started to cry and told me I'm am awful sister. That i don't care about Clara and her struggles and that she's just lost and he's underwater trying to keep her from going off a deep end. I didn't reply after that and have just been sitting around the house waiting for the police to call back, trying to get my crying out fo the way before Decker comes home from school. 

I feel wretched and terrible because not matter what I do now, it will just never feel right. I was to look after them all and now my sister is this lunatic hellbent on burning my life down and my brother is alarmingly just indifferent to it all. I am used to being the one that holds the family together and handle things. But I don't feel like I can handle anything anymore. Wtf is my life? 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS** 

**peachez728** 

>You are in a tough situation. Someone will have hurt feelings no matter what choice you make. At the end of the day you must do what is best for your family (wife & child). It’s hard letting go of family when you know they will flounder but you don’t want to sink with them. I bet your parents wouldn’t want you too either. 

**OOP** 

>>Oh, my mother would be furious with me right now. I can almost *hear* her berating me in the back of my skull telling me Kevin is right and I am supposed to take care of them not turn my back on any of them and to forgive because we are family and that's what family does. 

>>It's killing me, but it helps watching Decker. She's out back in the pool now that her homework is done, and she's chatting away with Honey while I ""work on dinner"". I've been staring at bell peppers for like 15 minutes battling my mom in my head with ""But look at her - she's safe and happy - wouldn't you want that?"" 

**~** 

**EvenSpoonier** 

>Sounds like you're doing the right thing, but *yikes*. 

>I'm not sure that helping pay for rehab is a bad idea, as long as it's an inpatient facility *and* there's a court order in place that will help govern when she can leave. The most important thing is keeping her away from your family. This would accomplish that, while also allowing you to say that she needs help and you're helping her get it. And who knows? Maybe she'll actually get the help she needs. 

**OOP** 

>>I really hope she does get help, but right now, I am focused on my daughter wnd wife. She was off the rails enough to strike me. It's not a full on attack but if she's capable of all of this, I don't know what she might do to my family and right now she's hyper fixated on us, and Decker in particular. 

>>She has my other siblings and her fiance, so I will let them handle this for now. I am more concerned for the safety of my home. I know that sounds terrible and maybe I am, but I just don't have the extra space in my mind to deal with this.

Hi, guys, so I created a profile just for this - I have a main account I use for my art. I don't really know how to post on this sub though, so please excuse any mistakes - also I think it's important to give a TW as this had violence and death involved and I know from personal experience that it can be triggering: 

So, I (F32, Deanna) am the eldest of five siblings, and I’ve taken on the role of the family caretaker for as long as I can remember. I helped our parents until their passing, and, frankly, it’s exhausting. Dad died of brain cancer 3 years ago, and it was heartbreaking to watch him deteriorate over time, and Mom passed peacefully overnight after a long hard battle with breast cancer earlier this year. 

FUCK cancer. 

So as the oldest, I just sort of became the de-facto parent. I don't mind as I love my siblings, and its kind of my thing to ""big sister"" friends and family a lot. I'm sort of ship's counselor, and I financially help out my family. I don't mind, as I work in tech, have a side gig doing art, and inherited land and money from mom and dad- all that to say it's no real loss. 

A few years ago, I adopted my cousin’s ""Charlie"" M45 child who I will just use her nickname ""Decker"" (my baby loves kickboxing) after my cousin went to prison for murdering the Decker's mother in an alcohol and drug-fueled rage - which is too long a story to add here. It was a chaotic year of mourning, paperwork and court hearings, but the adoption was finalized when the Decker was five. Now, she’s a happy, healthy 13-year-old who calls me “Mom.” She’s in therapy, and has been since I legally could send her as she witnessed her mother's death, and I couldn’t be prouder of how resilient she is. She's my girl, my rock-star, my whole heart and I call her that - literally ""My heart"". 

Fast forward to my sister’s, Clara (F30), upcoming wedding. I was thrilled for her at first, and she asked me to be MOH. I cried in joy and offered for my wife ""Honey"" (because we like The Incredible lol) F40 and I to pay for it (don't worry I asked Honey first). 

But during a bachelorette dinner I set up, she made a hurtful comment about my daughter, calling her a “mistake” and saying I “shouldn’t have taken her in.” I stared at her and asked her what she meant and she said it wasn't like I was supposed to even have kids, as I am married to another woman - then said ""no hate or anything"" and laughed but then she doubled down that Decker is likely damaged and a handful. 

Guys, Decker is the SWEETEST child alive. I mean she is a teen so yeah sometimes she can get challenging or rebellious here or there, but when I say she is my WHOLE heart, I mean it. She made us a family, and made our house a home. She smiles easy, cries openly and has the emotional intelligence I WISH I had myself. She always asks ""how are you doing?"" and she really means it, willing to listen to people. But she's a ""damaged"" ""mistake""!? 

I felt like a character in a dark, twisted episode of a sci-fi show—defending my choice to adopt felt like fighting the Borg, like I just wouldn’t assimilate. I didn't laugh it off with my sister and her friends. I just stared at her in pure disbelief. I think she knew I was hurt because she quickly changed the subject. I said I better get home, paid for everything and 3 more rounds and went home to my family. 

My sister came over the next day to yell at me for leaving and ""cutting them off"" after the 3 rounds I paid for. She said I owe her a do-over for ruining the whole weekend because I can't take a joke. Honey, who I of course told what happened, asked my sister to repeat exactly what she said about our daughter. My sister refused, and kept calling Decker ""Charlie's child"" and I just was holding back so many tears.  I told my sister that I wouldn’t be contributing a dime to her wedding expenses - that I won't stop helping her pay her rent up until she moves in with her husband, but I won't be in or pay for the wedding of a person who sees my child as a mistake. 

Honestly, I was ready to go full-on Jedi and sever that connection but Honey helped me temper myself. My sister lost it, threw the can of soda water we gave her at me, screamed ""How am I supposed to pay for this!?"" and I said, ""You have over a year, you can save up."" - so left, showving Honey out of the way in the process and blew up our sibling group chat. My other siblings are split. Some think I’m overreacting with cutting off funds for the wedding, while others agree that my sister crossed a line and needed the wake up call. 

Now, I feel bad for my sister - I do love her and she is distressed by this - but I can’t shake the feeling that standing up for my daughter is more important. AITA for refusing to pay for her wedding after that?

I am trying to keep this short.

Update 2: AITA for refusing to pay my sister’s wedding expenses after she called my child a ""mistake""? 

Edit to add the same trigger warnings as before sorry for forgetting - my brain is chaotic - TW: abuse, self harm, substance abuse, death, violence 

I kept my promise to my wife to wait before reacting. She knows me best and knew I was prepared to go nuclear. Turns out, I needn't have bothered. 

Let me clear up a couple of small details and misconceptions I've read. 

1. I am the eldest of the siblings. Mom and Dad have been sick for years on and off. So to those who think I've just started taken over as some weird power trip or something, no. I've managed their finances, maintained their properties, and taken care of all their affairs before either of them passed. Dad simply wasn't mentally able after a while and mom never had a head for that sort of thing. 

2. Yes, I was mostly left in charge of my siblings growing up. Both my parents had businesses and worked often 7 day weeks. I cooked dinner and helped with homework and whatnot. I'm aware that's not very normal, and I already know some of you will call my parents terrible for this but they simply didn't know better. I won't hate them for any of it and as much as it caused me some negative effects, it also made my siblings feel safe. I'm proud of being able to protect them and be there for them when they were young so they didn't feel how I felt. And yes, I am also in therapy. 

3. I was the sole caretaker of my parents when they passed. The reasons are complicated but the short of it is, Dad got verbally abusive towards the end and mom got severely depressed and blunt. They were a challenge to deal with on the best of days. I hold no ill will towards them, but there it is. My siblings didn't want to be around them. Dad was hurt and changed his will. Mom followed suit. 

4. For those telling me I am ""rewarding"" Clara by paying for literally this month, and that I'm not a real mom or a bad mom by loving my daughter's tormentor, I'm envious your world is so black and white. Rent is literally due today and the money was already in transfer to her via auto-banking. And Clara isn't getting rewarded, she is remaining *housed*. But from now on, she's on her own. 

5. Clara and I used to be pretty close but she did get distant around the time Decker was adopted. I didn't know exactly why, just that the new dynamic was a challenge for her. I know she *hates* Charlie and considers him evil and irredeemable. She had a really hard time losing our cousin-in-law, Decker's biological mother, as they were very close so I assume her issues stem from this. 

7. I inherited the majority of everything though my siblings got sizable sums, 3 got all but one of the businesses my parents owned, and everyone got trusts. Clara spiraled after mom passed and had a mental health crisis. Before we got her help, she traveled, drank, and gambled away her entire inheritance. Long story for another time. 

I didn't have a moment to cool down and wait until today to give myself a chance to make a level-headed decision regarding my sister. Clara has spun the tale that I am jealous she found a loving man and am withholding mom and dad's money from her. She gave the perception that I was the one abusing Decker, putting her down, and telling her she isn't my real daughter. That shut down when I sent my text a couple days ago. 

Yesterday, Clara was on my doorstep. She was crying and begging for me to let her in but my wife and her friends were inside and I made it clear I don't want her near my family as she emotionally abused my daughter and physically harmed my wife. I told her to leave or I would call the police to have her removed. I was going to call the police anyway because I told her never to come to our home again and there she was. There's a reason I said this in text, so I could -in an event like this- show them clear as day that she would know she is welcome. 

Clara started to beg saying she will apologize to Decker and she was drunk and upset and made mistakes. I could tell she was drunk. Or high. Or somethkng. I told her it's not a simple ""mistake"" to bully a traumatized teen girl and make her feel unloved and unwanted by her own family and to text her that she is worthless and expendable. What the fuck!? 

I got angry and just started to raise my voice. I dont know when I started to yell but I did. I just...lost it. 

She's a cold-hearted, awful, self-serving brat. Spoiled beyond belief to being so delusional that this all would just go away - that's she's *entitled* to the money my wife and I make, that our parents gave us after all she did. She needs fucking help and I am done being the giving tree here. You don't ever hurt my child. She's lucky I have a head to keep my hands to myself and luckier still Honey isn't out here because she certainly would not so go the fuck home. 

Clara slapped me across the face and called me a bitch and a traitor that I choose that ""demon spawn"" of a child over her. That I love Decker more than my own real family and turn my back on her this way. 

Honey must have been right by the door because before I could make a *very* bad choice she had yanked me inside, told my sister that she had 60 seconds to fuck off and slammed the door closed. 

Clara left quickly but we still called the police and handed over the footage from our property cameras of what happened, as well as the texts from our phones. Clara went ballistic over text telling me awful things ending with her hoping I take my own life and she would celebrate. Absolutely unhinged awful shit like that. I blocked her, sent every piece of footage In a google drive and dropped the link in the sibling group chat and sent it to ""Kevin"" her fiance. 

I then sat down and cried myself into a fit before Decker  came home from practice. I put on my ""mom"" face for her and made sure she did her homework then I went to the den and called my aunt - Decker's biological grandmother - and told her what happened. 

My aunt told me that Clara is renewing her conspiracy that I harming Decker and that I need to be careful because she suspects Clara is having some sort of mental break and might do something crazy. 

Honey and I have spent this whole day working on a request for a protective order from her. Making sure Decker's school knows no one is to pick her up but us. And get a lawyer because I think legal action is needed here. I told my eldest of the brothers that Clara needs help and asked if he could check on her because she might be as much a danger to herself as she is now presenting to be to me and my family. He got quiet and said ""Can't you handle this?"" And said this drama was too much and he's busy. 

I was so stunned I just blurted out ""Are you fucking kidding me right now?"" Before I just hung up. My other sister is now over, helping me deal with this. My other brother has gone to see after Clara, but says he will only make sure she hasn't hurt herself but beyond that she can get wrecked for what she's done. 

Kevin called me and said he went through the Google drive and begged me not to call the police on Clara. He said that she has been having a really bad time, and has struggled with drinking and has been stealing his medications and he's trying to get her help. But if she gets arrested, he doesn't have the funds for bail pr any legal help. I told him it's too late. The police have been called and he needs to get her into some sort of rehab or something. He asked for our help to pay for a facility he was thinking of and I told him to keep her away from me and my family. 

He started to cry and told me I'm am awful sister. That i don't care about Clara and her struggles and that she's just lost and he's underwater trying to keep her from going off a deep end. I didn't reply after that and have just been sitting around the house waiting for the police to call back, trying to get my crying out fo the way before Decker comes home from school. 

I feel wretched and terrible because not matter what I do now, it will just never feel right. I was to look after them all and now my sister is this lunatic hellbent on burning my life down and my brother is alarmingly just indifferent to it all. I am used to being the one that holds the family together and handle things. But I don't feel like I can handle anything anymore. Wtf is my life?

>You are in a tough situation. Someone will have hurt feelings no matter what choice you make. At the end of the day you must do what is best for your family (wife & child). It’s hard letting go of family when you know they will flounder but you don’t want to sink with them. I bet your parents wouldn’t want you too either. 

**OOP** 

>>Oh, my mother would be furious with me right now. I can almost *hear* her berating me in the back of my skull telling me Kevin is right and I am supposed to take care of them not turn my back on any of them and to forgive because we are family and that's what family does. 

>>It's killing me, but it helps watching Decker. She's out back in the pool now that her homework is done, and she's chatting away with Honey while I ""work on dinner"". I've been staring at bell peppers for like 15 minutes battling my mom in my head with ""But look at her - she's safe and happy - wouldn't you want that?"" 

**~** 

**EvenSpoonier** 

>Sounds like you're doing the right thing, but *yikes*. 

>I'm not sure that helping pay for rehab is a bad idea, as long as it's an inpatient facility *and* there's a court order in place that will help govern when she can leave. The most important thing is keeping her away from your family. This would accomplish that, while also allowing you to say that she needs help and you're helping her get it. And who knows? Maybe she'll actually get the help she needs. 

**OOP** 

>>I really hope she does get help, but right now, I am focused on my daughter wnd wife. She was off the rails enough to strike me. It's not a full on attack but if she's capable of all of this, I don't know what she might do to my family and right now she's hyper fixated on us, and Decker in particular. 

>>She has my other siblings and her fiance, so I will let them handle this for now. I am more concerned for the safety of my home. I know that sounds terrible and maybe I am, but I just don't have the extra space in my mind to deal with this.

**Editor's Note:** because there has been some confusion, the ""money in the bank 2024"" is a WWE (wrestling) event. That's why OOP posted in that sub! Here's a link to [the event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_in_the_Bank_(2024)) and info.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/1duoq4p/i_won_a_contest_to_see_money_in_the_bank_2024_but/)**: July 3, 2024**

I was thrilled when I got a dm on July 2nd that I had won two tickets to see money in the bank at the scotiabank arena on july 6th. It must be noted that I am a left leg amputee in a power wheelchair .My wife and I scrambled around to find a way to toronto on such short notice, but managed to find our local cab company with a wheelchair van that would bend over backwards to help us get there.

Anyone who is in a wheelchair, or has limited mobility will know that pre planning is key when it comes to a successful outing.

I let them know in my DM back that I am in a wheelchair so accessible seating is needed. They assured me that they were contacting the vendor to get the appropriate seating and that they were excited about me going. My wife was worried as she looked at the seating that was left ticket wise and saw it was a pretty slim amount of seating remaining. We were assured though that they were working on it.

Today July 3rd @ 2 pm today I got an email from them saying that they were unable to secure accessible seating. I am absolutely devastated. To have such a cool experience offered to me was a true miracle.

There is no way in my life that i would ever be able to afford to go myself as I am on disability support. (Disability supports are woefully inadequate and i have been a disability and poverty advocate for the last several years) Since I lost my leg 7 years ago I have not been able to afford to leave my city to travel very often as a wheelchair van is super expensive. It was a real stretch to be able to afford to even get to Money in the Bank, my wife and I have been saving wheelchair taxi scripts (like 1/2 price coupons that you can buy each month through our city) for years and were so happy that we figured out we had enough to go.

They have offered me the rate of 2 tickets $300 as per their contest rules. But how can you replace an experience like this for a guy that cannot even dream to have an opportunity to see and experience a show like this and get to the city? It’s like dangling something so fantastic in front of you, being just out of reach,and yanking it back at the very last minute.

I think this was very poor planning on the contest runners part. I am surprised that they would leave drawing the names of contest winners until 5 days before the event. Figuring out how to wrangle a trip is not easy for a lot of people these days, especially if you are disabled.

This is disability pride month and I am a proud disabled person, but this makes me feel lesser than. I am so devastated. I fight so hard in my community to ensure that events are accessible to all. I’m on city council accessibility advisory committee, I speak regularly with local groups, organizations and schools about disability and Indigenous rights. This makes me so sad that nothing could be done because of their poor planning and lack of foresight.

I have been an on and off fan of WWE since I was little and have been to a few house shows, even a network event in my manual wheelchair before I lost my leg. I was in such high spirits knowing that I was going to be able to see Cody Rhodes, Seth Rollins, Drew McIntyre, the women’s division, and most of all Kevin Owens.

I don’t expect anything to happen from telling my story, but I had to tell someone or vent in some way. I feel excluded and defeated.

Commenter: I'm a little confused here. You mention you would never be able to afford this due to being on disability but four months ago were making posts asking about the accessibility of Disney World as you were planning on taking a trip.

25 days ago you went to a convention in Niagara Falls.

3 months ago you got a new Pokémon themed tattoo in colour. I know nothing about tattoos except that a good tattoo is usually expensive.

>**OOP:** Yeah, that was due to a possibility of something huge happening (it did NOT pan out) The TL:DR on that Disney thing is that i was involved in a lawsuit for losing my leg and it did not pan out unfortunately. It was from using a drug called Invokana which can cause lower limb amputation IF i’d won the suit, i was gonna take my wife to Disney world If we could make it work (It would have been too difficult likely due to my health to be gone for that long)

So whatever happens, happens.

If i don’t get to go then i hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else. Like maybe people become more aware of accessibility and the like. It terrifies me that what if this had happened to a kid or something, right? I’m an adult and i can take bad news but this struck home hard for some reason.

I’m a spiritual person and i want to thank you for the well wishes and thoughts tonight. It has been overwhelming and i’m not afraid to admit, it has made me very emotional and i’ve cried cause i don’t know what to do with all these emotions.

I’ll update after i speak with the reporter tomorrow.

This is beyond words & I am stunned by the scope <3

u/wwe gifted me this cool briefcase and replica belt and escorted me inside & they were so kind and warm.

I’ve done a few TV interviews & i hope i don’t cry or something.

I have met SO many people from here and Twitter and you guys are absolutely wonderful!

Thank you for welcoming me into your space for this moment in time.

Final update:

Tonight was astounding beyond words.

I have met and interacted with so many of you from this sub reddit. You were friendly,gracious and generous with your time.

WWE went out of their way for me and treated me super well. My WWE rep went backstage and made sure I got Cody Rhodes’s autograph.

My view was amazing and i had so much fun. My voice is absolutely thrashed from cheering.

I did not expect what i saw tonight.

In conclusion, i hope things change for the better for accessibility where it possibly can. I’ll continue to advocate and volunteer in my community and elsewhere to help things improve.

Thank you for welcoming me into your space and being welcoming, kind and so friendly.

Good luck,good fortune and good journey to all of you :)

Be well

Thank you guys <3

My hope is that this helps generate a further conversation regarding accessibility. Like a lot can be overcome by being mindful, having a plan and listening to the disabled community.

I work with Guelph’s accessibility advisory committee and other groups here in the city and i think it’s getting better. Still a long way to go but thats ok as long as we move forward.

Like, i’m glad this went so awesome and WAY better than expected but i sincerely hope this is a teachable moment that can and will benefit everyone going forward.

**Editor's Note:** Link to [Cody Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Rhodes) and link to [Money in the Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_in_the_Bank_(2024)) WWE event for more information!

**Editor's Note 2:** u/knyghtez left a great comment explaining the event:

i know you didn’t ask specifically, but money in the bank is one of the most fun nights of wwe pro-wrestling. at the event, they hang a briefcase from the rafters and a bunch of wrestlers grab a bunch of ladders and create these incredible & violent tableaus, all trying to reach the briefcase first.

inside the briefcase is a contract that the briefcase winner can use to wrestle any champion at any time to try and win the championship from them, as long as there’s a ref to approve it. you can even use the contract after the champion has wrestled a whole match and are absolutely exhausted. it’s the perfect narrative molotov cocktail. wrestlers can have the briefcase & contract for up to a calendar year before they have to use it.

anyway, it’s not wrestlemania (the biggest) nor the royal rumble (my personal favorite) but it’s pretty dang fun and definitely one of the top wwe events.

cody rhodes is the current wwe champion after a grueling two years of wrestling and storytelling, and he is exactly they kind of person they advertise as a genuinely good dude. kids dress up like him all the time. he meets with fans in the audience for a long time after shows. so i’m happy it seems like here he did a good thing and that his wrestling persona seems to be based in something real.",5237,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1e21n1e/i_won_a_contest_to_see_money_in_the_bank_2024_but/,1720844671.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,"I won a contest to see money in the bank 2024 but because I’m in a wheelchair they cannot accommodate me **I am NOT the Original Poster.

u/wwe gifted me this cool briefcase and replica belt and escorted me inside & they were so kind and warm.

I’ve done a few TV interviews & i hope i don’t cry or something.

Tonight was astounding beyond words.

I have met and interacted with so many of you from this sub reddit. You were friendly,gracious and generous with your time.

WWE went out of their way for me and treated me super well. My WWE rep went backstage and made sure I got Cody Rhodes’s autograph.

My view was amazing and i had so much fun. My voice is absolutely thrashed from cheering.

I did not expect what i saw tonight.

In conclusion, i hope things change for the better for accessibility where it possibly can. I’ll continue to advocate and volunteer in my community and elsewhere to help things improve.

Thank you guys <3

My hope is that this helps generate a further conversation regarding accessibility. Like a lot can be overcome by being mindful, having a plan and listening to the disabled community.

I work with Guelph’s accessibility advisory committee and other groups here in the city and i think it’s getting better. Still a long way to go but thats ok as long as we move forward.

Like, i’m glad this went so awesome and WAY better than expected but i sincerely hope this is a teachable moment that can and will benefit everyone going forward.

**Editor's Note:** Link to [Cody Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Rhodes) and link to [Money in the Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_in_the_Bank_(2024)) WWE event for more information!

**Editor's Note 2:** u/knyghtez left a great comment explaining the event:

i know you didn’t ask specifically, but money in the bank is one of the most fun nights of wwe pro-wrestling. at the event, they hang a briefcase from the rafters and a bunch of wrestlers grab a bunch of ladders and create these incredible & violent tableaus, all trying to reach the briefcase first.

inside the briefcase is a contract that the briefcase winner can use to wrestle any champion at any time to try and win the championship from them, as long as there’s a ref to approve it. you can even use the contract after the champion has wrestled a whole match and are absolutely exhausted. it’s the perfect narrative molotov cocktail. wrestlers can have the briefcase & contract for up to a calendar year before they have to use it.

anyway, it’s not wrestlemania (the biggest) nor the royal rumble (my personal favorite) but it’s pretty dang fun and definitely one of the top wwe events.

cody rhodes is the current wwe champion after a grueling two years of wrestling and storytelling, and he is exactly they kind of person they advertise as a genuinely good dude. kids dress up like him all the time. he meets with fans in the audience for a long time after shows. so i’m happy it seems like here he did a good thing and that his wrestling persona seems to be based in something real."

**[New Update]: I kept a diary to track my wife's affection towards me, and it is as bad as I tell her it is**

**NEW UPDATE MARKED WITH** ----

**Trigger Warnings:** >!spousal neglect, mentions of past child abuse!<

--------------------------------------------------------

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/bWnDl5kXQB): **August 15, 2024**

I (34M) and my wife (43F) have been together for 16 years and married for 7. We have a 4-year-old daughter.

After the first few years where my wife was very kind, present, loving, and affectionate, things have changed a lot: I rarely receive kisses from her, let alone hugs or kind words. She doesn’t ask how I am in the morning, let alone say good morning or good night.

I am tired of this.

I have told her in every possible way that, as a man, I need these expressions of love to feel loved.

Her excuse is that she is too stressed because of the child (but these things were happening even before our daughter was born) or that everything depends on my behavior towards her; every time, it always depends only on me.

When we argue about this, she says I’m exaggerating.

Tired of arguing about this for a year, I have recorded in a diary all her expressions of love over the past month. Here you see a screenshot.

https://imgur.com/a/c8eJr14

I know it may seem exaggerated, but believe me, I am exhausted and don’t know how else to show her the lack of love I feel from her.

**Can you tell me if you, who have a beautiful marriage and are deeply in love with your husband/wife, have so few demonstrations of affection during the month?**

What I don’t understand is that, sexually, things are fine and we have sex 2-3 times a week, sometimes initiated by her.

I am fed up; I don’t feel loved as I would like, and I have lived like this for many years and now I can’t take it anymore. Please don’t get mad at me, everyone needs their own time to understand certain things, and I realized this over the past year.

I am a romantic, passionate, and attentive man. Normally, I can give 5-6 hugs a day, kisses, compliments, surprises, and I can talk about anything and discuss things in different ways. However, being treated like this makes me shut down and withdraw because of the lack of reciprocity.

I am seriously thinking of divorcing because I don’t feel heard or understood. I don’t see a person who understands and takes action to change the situation.

**Relevant Comments**

**What is the breakdown of the sacred chores or household work**

>I'm doing 50/50, working, watching the kid, trash, laundry, blah blah blah. The fact is that even before the kid she behaved like that. I don't want my wife to be my mommy and I'm fully capable to live alone and do everything (because I already had)

**GoldPeaco:** ""or that everything depends on my behavior towards her""

Can you elaborate on this one?

> **OOP:** Basically we're running in this circle until some months ago: I don't receive what I ask (affection) and I'm treated poorly so after a long time of patiently waiting for change I stonewall / get offended. We have a fight because of this. She says she has enough of the stone walling and me being offended because it hurts her. We end the fight with me being the one that ""swallows it"" and try to let it go, I try to tell her what is causing this and to take action. Time passes and we're again from the start. Some months ago I read about stonewalling and how bad it is so I ended it but still, it's really hard for me to get through this lack of affection. The problem is that I've been also treated very bad during this fights: yelled at, called names, divorce threatening by her side. I'm hurt on so many levels.

**OceanPoet87:** What are you doing to love her back? I feel like the diary can backfire because it focuses your emotions on her actions rather than on what you can control. 

> **OOP:** The diary is about facts not my emotions, if I receive no hugs for 5 days in a row it's no hugs for 5 days in a row. I tell her I love her, I tell her how beautiful she is, I joke with her, I buy her preferred premium soda when I do groceries, I ask her how she feels when she's ill and I take care of her. But do I feel reciprocated? Nah

**OOP elaborate more:** 

> Exactly this! I feel felt with this comment. Even if we have a difficult 4 yo child I mean, we have a lot of relaxed moments where I do kiss her, hug her for some seconds, tell her something nice. It is impossible that she's so stressed that she can't even hold my hand for some seconds.
> 
> I think that the issue with her is that she comes from a family where the father was really abusive (hitting, calling name, etc) and in constant fight with the mother (cheating). I think that she received love from her mother but she didn't from his father and that's the result. But from the other side I don't understand how she could give me what I needed the first 1/2 years of the relationship... just because it was new?
> 
> I also asked how her 2 previous relationships were with the partners, if they complained about these things, but she says they didn't and that she was giving them hugs etc (but in this case they were 3/4 years older than her)

**Commenter:** I'm not saying you were immature for your age, but you were still an 18 year old. You can only be so mature at that age, you know? I'm saying she had to be very immature for her age because it doesn't make sense otherwise. There had to be some manipulation there from her that you missed because you were an unassuming young man. Like you said, she had experience from previous relationships. She knew how to woo you in and get you to commit.

> **OOP:** Thanks, but why would a nice 27 yo woman pursue a 18 yo and manipulate him and get him to commit? what are your hyphoteses? Thanks 
> 
> **OOP:** But again, if you're 27, young and beautiful, won't you be able to do the same to same age men like you or older? They also already have everything in their life 
> 
> **Commentor:** No, because older men have more experience too and are harder to manipulate. Maybe they didn't want her for a reason? Maybe they saw she didn't have enough to offer for a long-term relationship? I'm just guessing, only you know the truth 
> 
> **OOP:** So you think they already understood her lack of affection and attention for a long-term relationship? The issues I'm having right now? I always thought that she doesn't have respect for me because (also) of the age gap so she doesn't treat me well... 
> 
> **Commentor:** When you think back to getting married, did she lack affection the majority of the marriage? If so, then yeah, I'd guess the other men probably noticed early on and didn't want to put up with it. If you feel she doesn't respect you, then that is a whole other problem  do you feel she looks down on you? 
> 
> OOP: Yep she did, I don't know how they were able to spot this

**OOP responds to multiple comments regarding the age gap, him being 18 and her at 27 at the time**

> She was not pursuing me, we just met in chat back in the old days, we talked and talked and then the interest born. She was very skeptical to consider me seriously because of the age but after some time she did, we met, we engaged. Could you please elaborate on ""Feel like the age gap could play a huge part""? What is you POV?
> 
> I was way more mature at my age because of my hard life before 18, so I wasn't an immature 18 year old freshman. I get your point, but you're missing some info. Maybe I was more mature and she was less mature? But still, I don't get why she had 2 relationships with guys 3/4 years older than her
> 
> So you think they already understood her lack of affection and attention for a long-term relationship? The issues I'm having right now? I always thought that she doesn't have respect for me because (also) of the age gap so she doesn't treat me well...

**Did OOP do something for his wife and if so, what was her response?**

> **OOP:** Yes, 2 months ago I even questioned myself to the point I treated her like a princess for 2 weeks straight: not getting offended, telling her constantly how I love her, how sexy she is, hugging, kissing a lot of times with hearth but what I received in return? Just 2 compliments and 1 ""I love you"" in 2 weeks. After this I felt so bad and not reciprocated that I decided to not do this ""test"" (if you want to call it this way) anymore. It hurt too much

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/brwrmReKjb): **August 18, 2024**

These days, after publishing the post, I've spent a lot of time reading online, watching reels, watching YouTube videos to better understand my situation, and thanks to one of these, I discovered the issue of Avoidant Attachment Style.

I was stunned by how closely my wife fit the description, and I set out to thoroughly study the case.

I also identified other things I should do in my relationship: set clear boundaries, demand that my requests are understood, respected, and fulfilled, stand firm in my position, and if necessary, make it clear that I am willing to leave.

I showed the Excel sheet to my wife the next day.

Her first response was, ""But yesterday we cuddled."" I told her, ""Look at the facts over the past month, there are things you never do and the few things you do are a result of my complaints or arguments. They’re not debatable, I’m sorry.""

Then I told her what I discovered and how she fits into the case, I read her the main characteristics of these people and the types of traumas they have gone through in their lives. I explained to her (knowing her personal family story) that this was mainly thanks to the abuse she received when she was a kid from her parents. My wife was stunned and listened, then asked me, ""So what should I do to solve this?""

My answer was ""I don't know"" because I really don't know. The thing I do know, and what I told her, is that these problems were generated in her childhood and need to be addressed now.

I'm now informing myself about the options available to solve or at least alleviate these issues. Sadly we have difficult schedules so a therapist is now off the table.

During the day I cried a lot because finally, after 16 years, I understood why we had these problems. A strong sadness came over me because I recalled all the situations where I was treated badly, with indifference, and did not receive the affection I wanted. I also remembered all the lies and manipulations used over time to cover up her shortcomings.

I think the first step is to focus on myself and solve my own problems since I developed an Anxious Attachment Style. I'll probably use an online course and books to do this since I have very little time between my daughter and work.

If it works, I will propose it to my wife, who says, ""I understand, don’t worry, now I know what I need to give you without courses or anything,"" but I have serious doubts about this statement and will continue to track what happens in my diary to have objective data.

I’ve already told her that if, unfortunately, this situation doesn’t resolve, I will proceed with divorce, and when I do, if forced, I won’t go back.

That will be the end.

I will also follow the excellent advice from [https://www.reddit.com/user/FeelingOk2951/](https://www.reddit.com/user/FeelingOk2951/) in the meantime.

I will let you know what happens.

Personally, I want to see how things go next week. I am sure (unless I am mistaken) that my wife will only last three days. In any case, I will continue on my path to heal and be ready for a new relationship when the time comes.

Stay tuned.

If anyone has experience with a spouse healing from an Avoidant Attachment Style please let me know!

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/wCfXweU4Ow): **August 23, 2024**

So, as expected my wife lasted less than 3 days, actually just 1 (in terms of giving kisses, hugs, cuddling).

But it doesn't matter, I found all the things I need to fix in me so I'm starting the journey alone in order to grow and be able, without hesitation, to proceed with a divorce and don't go back to her.

I'm also seeing a lawyer to have everything checked before I proceed in the future.

The interesting thing is that I listed all my insecurities and issues related to the trauma I experienced in my childhood and I see a lot of thing that I need to work about and to fix in me

I asked out of curiosity to my wife what are the top 3 things she things should be fixed (expecting them to be at least 10 items) but she just told me that defensiveness and stonewalling are the only two things and that, without them, I would be a perfect husband.

I was stunned and confused the whole day. I also asked her if removing these 2 things would result in her loving me more, but she told me no because she already loves me the way I am and this is just my cross...

So it seems she's happy with the marriage while I'm not. I want more from a relationship, at least the basic caring of a wife

I don't think I'll give you any other update because I'll be focused improving things in myself, but once the times come for me to proceed with the divorce, I'll let you know what happens

Stay tuned

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP responds on how he is moving forward and working on himself**

> Thanks for sharing your story. While I'm trying to start my healing process I'm literally crying every day preparing myself for divorce. The probability of her change is less than 1% and the issues we have are deep rooted in the past. I tried everything to get her attention, I gave her all the love I could possibly give, I tried so many times to accomodate to her way of being but I have enough. I'm heart broken. My dear wife, my dear lovely wife, my first woman in my life. I did everything I could to love her with all my heart and be recognised for this, loved for this. Every small bid for attention is lost in the dark. I'm really heart broken, I'm just preparing myself for the divorce, trying to cry out all the tears before I finally tell her I'm leaving. It's one of the most difficult things to do in my life, and believe me, I did crazy and difficult things in the past. This one is probably going to kill me but I need to proceed. I can't live like that any longer and I don't want my child to see and become like this because the chances for her to find a good partner will lower considerably...

**Did OOP try to connect with his wife over the years, being affectionate in their marriage?**

> **OOP:** Yes I tried that for a couple of years, also during covid, but man, it was hell. Me just working, playing video games till 1/2 in the morning, sometimes watch a movie with her where she always fell asleep... no real connection. Just me doing something and she on her phone... I remember one time one friend of ours saying that he was about to disconnect from the game because he was ""requested"" by his girlfriend that wanted to stay with him and watch something together... I tried this but it feels to me like I'm always missing something, I don't have that deep connection, I'm alone, and feel alone. Then, when we have arguments, I have no love bank filled to be able to face that (you know sort of: ok you're mean to me but 3 hours ago you were kissing me telling me I love you), I have only negative feelings. Also this way of being it's not me. I want to feel wanted. I want to be cuddled. I need love. If I'm feeling bad I want someone being able to hug me and tell me ""sweetheart don't worry, everything is going to be all right"". She never does this, instead says things like ""level up"" ""life is hard blah blah blah"". I know that it's her traumas and I don't have any resentment towards her. I just can't keep up with this. Also I love to give love, stopping from doing this is devastating. I also have other issues like she almost never initiate any discussion, doesn't allocate time for me, it's always me chasing her and I have enough of it. Sex can't be our only way of connection. She's always with me but her mind is somewhere else. I tried to enter in her mind, but no luck in 16 years.
+ 
> It's been a full year that I'm talking about this issue with my wife. And she frequently denied it by saying things like ""it's not true"" ""tomorrow I'll show you"" ""this very morning I gave you a kiss, I'm affectionate"", ""see other couples they don't engage any more after all these years"", blah blah blah. How would you feel after 1 full year of sweet attempts to talk about an issue? And frequently she would say that her lack of affection is due to me doing x y z. I'd to create the spreadsheet to have EVIDENCE of an issue. And the evidence shows that the affection I receive it's only when I have a fight with her or I complain the day before. 1 day of change followed by weeks of nothing. It bothered her and she was angry, sure, I get the frustration of seeing something like that, but does she get my 1 year frustration? And I'm not threatening divorce over a spreadsheet, I'm threatening over 1 year of trying to talk and solve the issue. I could've said just ""I'm done, bye bye"" 1 year ago, I rather fought with everything that came to my mind
+
> Yeah, so I created a spreadsheet after months, months, of no affection. So you could create a spreadsheet with 0 in every cell for 90 days. You don't know what you're talking about and surely you don't know what it feels like to receive no affection in a marriage for so long. Do I have personal issues and traumas? Yes Sir, and I'm going to address them. Does my wife have issues and traumas? Yes Sir, but is she going to do something about it? Nope (at least this will be the most probable scenario). So hence the divorce so she can provide her careless to whoever she wants to

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Update #3](https://new.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ffe1mh/update_3_i_kept_a_diary_to_track_my_wifes/): **September 12, 2024**

I decided to write an update on my story and let you know how things are going.

Previous post -> https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ez8tc5/update_2_i_kept_a_diary_to_track_my_wifes/

I began my journey of shadow work on my own. I thoroughly read about how to do it, studied everything carefully, and started confronting (with much pain) my past and what I experienced in my family of origin.

The first thing I realized was this very clingy and needy part of me that craved love, a bit too much, and I understood what a wounded and defenseless child lived inside me. I realized I needed to embrace him, hold him, and take care of him myself, as I was the only one who could give him unconditional and always available love.

It might sound strange, but realizing this allowed me to somehow talk to my deep self, embrace him, and make him understand that now I comprehend, I am here, I protect, and I am here for him.

From that moment, I stopped seeking attention from my wife, a total reset, and with the new love I now know how to show myself, I feel calm, secure, and most importantly, no longer needy.

I stopped seeking my wife entirely, no kisses, no hugs, no sweet words, and zero conversations initiated by me. If she wants to, she can do it, otherwise, I am no longer interested. I am happy with myself.

In the two weeks this has been happening, she hasn't complained about anything. This made me realize that my hypotheses regarding her type of attachment were correct.

After realizing this, I understood almost all the things that trigger me in my marriage and why, linking them to the traumas I experienced in the past.

I first tackled the issues of criticism and stonewalling.

I discovered that because of how my mother treated me and all the physical and verbal abuse from my stepfather (who hated me), I was always hyper-vigilant in trying to understand if I was in danger and if anyone wanted to harm or criticize me.

I suffered immensely reliving all this again, but I managed to understand why I was triggered, reasoned about why all this happened, tried to put myself in my mother’s and stepfather’s shoes to understand why they became the way they did (I know both of their childhood stories), and I have radically desensitized myself from this.

Without going into details, I told my wife that I resolved that one problem she always talked to me about, and to see the results in the following days.

In the following days, there were countless situations where I would normally have exploded and/or stonewalled, but I got through them calmly and unscathed, without being triggered. Even in important situations.

This made me happy because I realized how much my past was negatively impacting my present.

Unfortunately, although we no longer have frequent arguments with my wife, she hasn't had significant changes. I just saw her happier and calmer, but she hasn't changed at all. I had asked her before starting this journey if resolving this issue would make her the loving, present, in-love woman from 2008 again. She said yes, but I have yet to see any changes.

Some evenings she has come to hug me for barely 3 minutes, once she gave me a quick kiss calling me love, that's it.

It’s okay, at the moment the focus is that I need to heal.

What surprised me the most instead was the rapid response of my 4-year-old daughter. Becoming calmer and more confident, I saw a surge in her tranquility and happiness, and now she wants to play and spend time with me much more willingly. She immediately noticed the change and feels very secure with me. This filled me with joy, and I bonded even more with her.

Continuing the shadow work, I am now dealing with another theme: the constant arguments and rejections from my stepfather whenever I asked for something.

Every time I asked for something, like going out with friends, going to eat a pizza, playing soccer, or some money to buy a sandwich in the evening, there were always constant arguments where he said no, I had to fight with him, argue endlessly. Besides the many noes, he always repeated that the NOs were tied to things I hadn’t done or things I had done wrong. I won't go into details now because otherwise, this post would become too long, but believe me, he hated me to death and nearly drove me to suicide.

Reliving all this crap, I understood the dynamics in the relationship with my wife who, although she does a lot wrong, always tells me that everything depends on me and what I did/didn't do with her.

I am almost done addressing this aspect, the rejections from my stepfather, my inferiority, anxiety, low self-esteem, and little by little, I am discovering a sea of self-esteem, grit, determination, and anger that lies within me.

With my wife, I am becoming a different person: confident, strong, understanding her needs as well. In these two weeks, I have experienced a calm and serenity that I hadn’t felt in a long time. Zero arguments with my wife and zero dramas.

But unfortunately, there is a but.

As you know, we have a stressful situation with our daughter, and sometimes the days are very heated. Like 2 days ago.

In one of these, my wife verbally insulted me, using various bad words, but I confronted her (without using bad words or anything) that she can save that behavior for her street friends, not for me, her husband (I hadn’t done anything wrong in that situation). The next day we had another situation where she physically threatened to slap me, again I wasn’t scared but rather, a strong anger and desire to defend myself arose within me. I told her that she absolutely must not dare, and I no longer tolerate these things, I am not the same person anymore, and I am not afraid of her.

So my life now is really heated with many problems and changes happening, doing this shadow work hurts, but the results are there and are evident.

I am finally understanding myself, helping myself, my self-esteem is rebuilding, and it is drastically changing my family dynamics.

I am also going to the lawyer next week to clearly understand my situation and what a divorce would entail regarding my daughter, money, and other factors.

Finally, I am no longer afraid of being left or leaving my wife, which is what has held me back for 16 years from taking this step if necessary.

I’ll end with two things:

1. I hope to heal quickly, now that I am healing I can more easily recognize my wife's problems and how to help her. I aim to be at least 90% healed before explaining to her how I resolved my issues and what I am now.

2. Many of you criticized me for my Excel diary, but it was useful to do it, not so much for my wife, but for me. Now that I recognize my flaws, insecurities, fears, anxieties, and triggers, I know what to work on.

Until next time!

**Additional Information from OOP**

> **OOP:** I'm using the time to heal, having someone who triggers you helps you understand better yourself. Once I'm healed and I'm sure, I can proceed with the divorce with calm and serenity, if things don't improve. She needs to heal as well but now I'm not in the position to tell her anything or to expect anything, first I need to heal. If she decides that she is ok the way she is then a bye bye is guaranteed.

**OOP on what resources he used to deal with his trauma**

> **OOP:** Nothing specific, I'm just using a moleskine and a pen. I'm exploring my traumas with 5 questions:
1.	What am I doing right now? And I explain what triggers me, how, what are the emotions involved, what are the people involved. I try to be as honest as possible
2.	What are the past experiences that lead me to this behaviour? I explore my child trauma related to this behaviour, what happened, just stating facts I remember and connecting the dots
3.	Why this happened? Where I explore the people involved (mostly my mother and step father). I put myself in their shoes and understand their trauma and POV, so they no more are monsters now but simple grown children with traumas and issues. I then have compassion for them and I forgive them
4.	What did I understand? Where I reason on what I understood by answering the 3 questions above
5.	What do you want to say to yourself? Where I talk to myself and I hug myself and explain to myself that is ok to feel the way I feel, that I'm strong now, that I'm here for me

And then I feel ""free""

[Update #4](https://new.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1fki3oe/update_4_i_kept_a_diary_to_track_my_wifes/): **September 19, 2024**

It has been 7 days and I want to give you an update on how things are going.

The last post is this one -> https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ffe1mh/update_3_i_kept_a_diary_to_track_my_wifes/

I'll break it down into points to make it easier to read:

**1) My Healing Process**

It’s going really well, I’ve dealt with more issues from my childhood and all of this has given me incredible confidence and self-esteem.

After years of hating myself and calling myself awful names, I looked in the mirror and loved myself. I actually said: “I love you, and you are the most important person in my life. I love you exactly as you are, with your strengths and weaknesses.”

These were the words I always sought from a woman, but my wife never said or made me feel this way. I did it for myself.

Now that I’ve matured, I’ve become a man for the first time. I realized that no one was going to come help me and that it was all and only up to me. I understood that everything is my sole responsibility, and I alone can change what happens in my life.

From this moment on, when I have difficult and sad times because of my situation, I no longer end up in despair. I’m there to console myself and lift my spirits. This is so new for me that I’m genuinely happy for the first time in my life.

In the coming weeks, I’m tackling the remaining issues. I think I’ll be done in 1-2 weeks.

Why is everything progressing so quickly? Because I’m extremely clear about my problems, I have the will to descend into hell each time to face everything again, and I know how to proceed (I described it last time).

**2) Relationship with My Daughter**

My daughter is quickly understanding who’s taking control and leading this family. I’ve noticed that she has started to respect me more, look for me more, and trust me more. She is the one who’s grasping what’s happening the fastest.

I am falling more and more in love with my daughter, and I’m realizing how much my personal self-esteem issues were negatively impacting her life. Now that I’m healing, she’s healing too.

I’m over the moon about this.

**3) Relationship with Others**

I’ve stopped being a people-pleaser. I no longer care about looking nice, being agreeable, or thanking people too much.

Simple, precise, and well-formulated interactions without fear. I don’t even recognize myself.

Every time I act differently from the past, I feel a fire of self-esteem inside that confirms what I’ve resolved in my mind.

**4) Relationship with My Wife**

Obviously, it’s not going well, which shouldn’t come as a surprise. I’m discussing everything with my lawyer to prepare for the divorce (in my country, there are specific laws and situations to be aware of).

My wife is not taking the power shift well, but:

The disrespect has decreased. I no longer accept being yelled at in the face—it’s unacceptable.

After several times of trying to calm her down, she threatened me, saying that we need to talk about going our separate ways, that the chances she gave me have run out, that it’s necessary to separate for the common good, etc.

One particular day, she mentioned it several times in the afternoon, and I replied: “Okay, let’s talk. I agree; we should go our separate ways. I need a real woman who loves me. I don’t need to stay with you.”

Each time, she watched my reactions. By the evening, she was silent and didn’t say anything. Two days later, she said again that we should talk about separation, and I again said, “Okay, no problem.” This morning, she put on makeup (I ignored her) and came to give me a kiss, saying that for the sake of the family, we need to give the relationship another chance.

However, I have understood what happened and why I’m in this situation:

When we met, I was 18 years old and insecure. I felt ugly, lonely, and miserable in my family home and was desperately looking for a woman to be with.

She is very beautiful and probably, after two relationships with bad boy archetypes where she was treated poorly and many dates with people with healthy attachments who recognized her (avoidant attachment) and didn’t continue, she found me: an insecure, good guy with nice ideals to drain all the love and sweetness she could, offering me only her beauty and sex as a reward.

Without the need to invest herself, without the need to commit to this relationship.

I was very hurt to discover all of this, but we move forward. Sometimes I am angry with her, other times I think about how “broken” I was, and it was my fault too. But it doesn't matter; my healing process moves forward and takes precedence.

To remove further power from her, I told her that I no longer want to have sex with her. I don’t intend to let my mind get clouded by sex. I need a person who loves, esteems, and cares for me 24/7. Then sex happens because it is the cherry on top of all the love, not a tool to control me.

Until next time!

--------------------------------------------------------

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/bWnDl5kXQB): **August 15, 2024**

I (34M) and my wife (43F) have been together for 16 years and married for 7. We have a 4-year-old daughter.

After the first few years where my wife was very kind, present, loving, and affectionate, things have changed a lot: I rarely receive kisses from her, let alone hugs or kind words. She doesn’t ask how I am in the morning, let alone say good morning or good night.

I am tired of this.

I have told her in every possible way that, as a man, I need these expressions of love to feel loved.

Her excuse is that she is too stressed because of the child (but these things were happening even before our daughter was born) or that everything depends on my behavior towards her; every time, it always depends only on me.

When we argue about this, she says I’m exaggerating.

Tired of arguing about this for a year, I have recorded in a diary all her expressions of love over the past month. Here you see a screenshot.

https://imgur.com/a/c8eJr14

I know it may seem exaggerated, but believe me, I am exhausted and don’t know how else to show her the lack of love I feel from her.

**Can you tell me if you, who have a beautiful marriage and are deeply in love with your husband/wife, have so few demonstrations of affection during the month?**

What I don’t understand is that, sexually, things are fine and we have sex 2-3 times a week, sometimes initiated by her.

I am fed up; I don’t feel loved as I would like, and I have lived like this for many years and now I can’t take it anymore. Please don’t get mad at me, everyone needs their own time to understand certain things, and I realized this over the past year.

I am a romantic, passionate, and attentive man. Normally, I can give 5-6 hugs a day, kisses, compliments, surprises, and I can talk about anything and discuss things in different ways. However, being treated like this makes me shut down and withdraw because of the lack of reciprocity.

I am seriously thinking of divorcing because I don’t feel heard or understood. I don’t see a person who understands and takes action to change the situation.

**Relevant Comments**

**What is the breakdown of the sacred chores or household work**

>I'm doing 50/50, working, watching the kid, trash, laundry, blah blah blah. The fact is that even before the kid she behaved like that. I don't want my wife to be my mommy and I'm fully capable to live alone and do everything (because I already had)

**GoldPeaco:** ""or that everything depends on my behavior towards her""

Can you elaborate on this one?

> **OOP:** Basically we're running in this circle until some months ago: I don't receive what I ask (affection) and I'm treated poorly so after a long time of patiently waiting for change I stonewall / get offended. We have a fight because of this. She says she has enough of the stone walling and me being offended because it hurts her. We end the fight with me being the one that ""swallows it"" and try to let it go, I try to tell her what is causing this and to take action. Time passes and we're again from the start. Some months ago I read about stonewalling and how bad it is so I ended it but still, it's really hard for me to get through this lack of affection. The problem is that I've been also treated very bad during this fights: yelled at, called names, divorce threatening by her side. I'm hurt on so many levels.

**OceanPoet87:** What are you doing to love her back? I feel like the diary can backfire because it focuses your emotions on her actions rather than on what you can control. 

> **OOP:** The diary is about facts not my emotions, if I receive no hugs for 5 days in a row it's no hugs for 5 days in a row. I tell her I love her, I tell her how beautiful she is, I joke with her, I buy her preferred premium soda when I do groceries, I ask her how she feels when she's ill and I take care of her. But do I feel reciprocated? Nah

**OOP elaborate more:** 

> Exactly this! I feel felt with this comment. Even if we have a difficult 4 yo child I mean, we have a lot of relaxed moments where I do kiss her, hug her for some seconds, tell her something nice. It is impossible that she's so stressed that she can't even hold my hand for some seconds.
> 
> I think that the issue with her is that she comes from a family where the father was really abusive (hitting, calling name, etc) and in constant fight with the mother (cheating). I think that she received love from her mother but she didn't from his father and that's the result. But from the other side I don't understand how she could give me what I needed the first 1/2 years of the relationship... just because it was new?
> 
> I also asked how her 2 previous relationships were with the partners, if they complained about these things, but she says they didn't and that she was giving them hugs etc (but in this case they were 3/4 years older than her)

**Commenter:** I'm not saying you were immature for your age, but you were still an 18 year old. You can only be so mature at that age, you know? I'm saying she had to be very immature for her age because it doesn't make sense otherwise. There had to be some manipulation there from her that you missed because you were an unassuming young man. Like you said, she had experience from previous relationships. She knew how to woo you in and get you to commit.

> **OOP:** Thanks, but why would a nice 27 yo woman pursue a 18 yo and manipulate him and get him to commit? what are your hyphoteses? Thanks 
> 
> **OOP:** But again, if you're 27, young and beautiful, won't you be able to do the same to same age men like you or older? They also already have everything in their life 
> 
> **Commentor:** No, because older men have more experience too and are harder to manipulate. Maybe they didn't want her for a reason? Maybe they saw she didn't have enough to offer for a long-term relationship? I'm just guessing, only you know the truth 
> 
> **OOP:** So you think they already understood her lack of affection and attention for a long-term relationship? The issues I'm having right now? I always thought that she doesn't have respect for me because (also) of the age gap so she doesn't treat me well... 
> 
> **Commentor:** When you think back to getting married, did she lack affection the majority of the marriage? If so, then yeah, I'd guess the other men probably noticed early on and didn't want to put up with it. If you feel she doesn't respect you, then that is a whole other problem  do you feel she looks down on you? 
> 
> OOP: Yep she did, I don't know how they were able to spot this

**OOP responds to multiple comments regarding the age gap, him being 18 and her at 27 at the time**

> She was not pursuing me, we just met in chat back in the old days, we talked and talked and then the interest born. She was very skeptical to consider me seriously because of the age but after some time she did, we met, we engaged. Could you please elaborate on ""Feel like the age gap could play a huge part""? What is you POV?
> 
> I was way more mature at my age because of my hard life before 18, so I wasn't an immature 18 year old freshman. I get your point, but you're missing some info. Maybe I was more mature and she was less mature? But still, I don't get why she had 2 relationships with guys 3/4 years older than her
> 
> So you think they already understood her lack of affection and attention for a long-term relationship? The issues I'm having right now? I always thought that she doesn't have respect for me because (also) of the age gap so she doesn't treat me well...

**Did OOP do something for his wife and if so, what was her response?**

> **OOP:** Yes, 2 months ago I even questioned myself to the point I treated her like a princess for 2 weeks straight: not getting offended, telling her constantly how I love her, how sexy she is, hugging, kissing a lot of times with hearth but what I received in return? Just 2 compliments and 1 ""I love you"" in 2 weeks. After this I felt so bad and not reciprocated that I decided to not do this ""test"" (if you want to call it this way) anymore. It hurt too much

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/brwrmReKjb): **August 18, 2024**

These days, after publishing the post, I've spent a lot of time reading online, watching reels, watching YouTube videos to better understand my situation, and thanks to one of these, I discovered the issue of Avoidant Attachment Style.

I was stunned by how closely my wife fit the description, and I set out to thoroughly study the case.

I also identified other things I should do in my relationship: set clear boundaries, demand that my requests are understood, respected, and fulfilled, stand firm in my position, and if necessary, make it clear that I am willing to leave.

I showed the Excel sheet to my wife the next day.

Her first response was, ""But yesterday we cuddled."" I told her, ""Look at the facts over the past month, there are things you never do and the few things you do are a result of my complaints or arguments. They’re not debatable, I’m sorry.""

Then I told her what I discovered and how she fits into the case, I read her the main characteristics of these people and the types of traumas they have gone through in their lives. I explained to her (knowing her personal family story) that this was mainly thanks to the abuse she received when she was a kid from her parents. My wife was stunned and listened, then asked me, ""So what should I do to solve this?""

My answer was ""I don't know"" because I really don't know. The thing I do know, and what I told her, is that these problems were generated in her childhood and need to be addressed now.

I'm now informing myself about the options available to solve or at least alleviate these issues. Sadly we have difficult schedules so a therapist is now off the table.

During the day I cried a lot because finally, after 16 years, I understood why we had these problems. A strong sadness came over me because I recalled all the situations where I was treated badly, with indifference, and did not receive the affection I wanted. I also remembered all the lies and manipulations used over time to cover up her shortcomings.

I think the first step is to focus on myself and solve my own problems since I developed an Anxious Attachment Style. I'll probably use an online course and books to do this since I have very little time between my daughter and work.

If it works, I will propose it to my wife, who says, ""I understand, don’t worry, now I know what I need to give you without courses or anything,"" but I have serious doubts about this statement and will continue to track what happens in my diary to have objective data.

I’ve already told her that if, unfortunately, this situation doesn’t resolve, I will proceed with divorce, and when I do, if forced, I won’t go back.

That will be the end.

I will also follow the excellent advice from [https://www.reddit.com/user/FeelingOk2951/](https://www.reddit.com/user/FeelingOk2951/) in the meantime.

I will let you know what happens.

Personally, I want to see how things go next week. I am sure (unless I am mistaken) that my wife will only last three days. In any case, I will continue on my path to heal and be ready for a new relationship when the time comes.

Stay tuned.

If anyone has experience with a spouse healing from an Avoidant Attachment Style please let me know!

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/wCfXweU4Ow): **August 23, 2024**

So, as expected my wife lasted less than 3 days, actually just 1 (in terms of giving kisses, hugs, cuddling).

But it doesn't matter, I found all the things I need to fix in me so I'm starting the journey alone in order to grow and be able, without hesitation, to proceed with a divorce and don't go back to her.

I'm also seeing a lawyer to have everything checked before I proceed in the future.

The interesting thing is that I listed all my insecurities and issues related to the trauma I experienced in my childhood and I see a lot of thing that I need to work about and to fix in me

I asked out of curiosity to my wife what are the top 3 things she things should be fixed (expecting them to be at least 10 items) but she just told me that defensiveness and stonewalling are the only two things and that, without them, I would be a perfect husband.

I was stunned and confused the whole day. I also asked her if removing these 2 things would result in her loving me more, but she told me no because she already loves me the way I am and this is just my cross...

So it seems she's happy with the marriage while I'm not. I want more from a relationship, at least the basic caring of a wife

I don't think I'll give you any other update because I'll be focused improving things in myself, but once the times come for me to proceed with the divorce, I'll let you know what happens

Stay tuned

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP responds on how he is moving forward and working on himself**

> Thanks for sharing your story. While I'm trying to start my healing process I'm literally crying every day preparing myself for divorce. The probability of her change is less than 1% and the issues we have are deep rooted in the past. I tried everything to get her attention, I gave her all the love I could possibly give, I tried so many times to accomodate to her way of being but I have enough. I'm heart broken. My dear wife, my dear lovely wife, my first woman in my life. I did everything I could to love her with all my heart and be recognised for this, loved for this. Every small bid for attention is lost in the dark. I'm really heart broken, I'm just preparing myself for the divorce, trying to cry out all the tears before I finally tell her I'm leaving. It's one of the most difficult things to do in my life, and believe me, I did crazy and difficult things in the past. This one is probably going to kill me but I need to proceed. I can't live like that any longer and I don't want my child to see and become like this because the chances for her to find a good partner will lower considerably...

**Did OOP try to connect with his wife over the years, being affectionate in their marriage?**

> **OOP:** Yes I tried that for a couple of years, also during covid, but man, it was hell. Me just working, playing video games till 1/2 in the morning, sometimes watch a movie with her where she always fell asleep... no real connection. Just me doing something and she on her phone... I remember one time one friend of ours saying that he was about to disconnect from the game because he was ""requested"" by his girlfriend that wanted to stay with him and watch something together... I tried this but it feels to me like I'm always missing something, I don't have that deep connection, I'm alone, and feel alone. Then, when we have arguments, I have no love bank filled to be able to face that (you know sort of: ok you're mean to me but 3 hours ago you were kissing me telling me I love you), I have only negative feelings. Also this way of being it's not me. I want to feel wanted. I want to be cuddled. I need love. If I'm feeling bad I want someone being able to hug me and tell me ""sweetheart don't worry, everything is going to be all right"". She never does this, instead says things like ""level up"" ""life is hard blah blah blah"". I know that it's her traumas and I don't have any resentment towards her. I just can't keep up with this. Also I love to give love, stopping from doing this is devastating. I also have other issues like she almost never initiate any discussion, doesn't allocate time for me, it's always me chasing her and I have enough of it. Sex can't be our only way of connection. She's always with me but her mind is somewhere else. I tried to enter in her mind, but no luck in 16 years.
+ 
> It's been a full year that I'm talking about this issue with my wife. And she frequently denied it by saying things like ""it's not true"" ""tomorrow I'll show you"" ""this very morning I gave you a kiss, I'm affectionate"", ""see other couples they don't engage any more after all these years"", blah blah blah. How would you feel after 1 full year of sweet attempts to talk about an issue? And frequently she would say that her lack of affection is due to me doing x y z. I'd to create the spreadsheet to have EVIDENCE of an issue. And the evidence shows that the affection I receive it's only when I have a fight with her or I complain the day before. 1 day of change followed by weeks of nothing. It bothered her and she was angry, sure, I get the frustration of seeing something like that, but does she get my 1 year frustration? And I'm not threatening divorce over a spreadsheet, I'm threatening over 1 year of trying to talk and solve the issue. I could've said just ""I'm done, bye bye"" 1 year ago, I rather fought with everything that came to my mind
+
> Yeah, so I created a spreadsheet after months, months, of no affection. So you could create a spreadsheet with 0 in every cell for 90 days. You don't know what you're talking about and surely you don't know what it feels like to receive no affection in a marriage for so long. Do I have personal issues and traumas? Yes Sir, and I'm going to address them. Does my wife have issues and traumas? Yes Sir, but is she going to do something about it? Nope (at least this will be the most probable scenario). So hence the divorce so she can provide her careless to whoever she wants to

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Update #3](https://new.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ffe1mh/update_3_i_kept_a_diary_to_track_my_wifes/): **September 12, 2024**

I decided to write an update on my story and let you know how things are going.

Previous post -> https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ez8tc5/update_2_i_kept_a_diary_to_track_my_wifes/

I began my journey of shadow work on my own. I thoroughly read about how to do it, studied everything carefully, and started confronting (with much pain) my past and what I experienced in my family of origin.

The first thing I realized was this very clingy and needy part of me that craved love, a bit too much, and I understood what a wounded and defenseless child lived inside me. I realized I needed to embrace him, hold him, and take care of him myself, as I was the only one who could give him unconditional and always available love.

It might sound strange, but realizing this allowed me to somehow talk to my deep self, embrace him, and make him understand that now I comprehend, I am here, I protect, and I am here for him.

From that moment, I stopped seeking attention from my wife, a total reset, and with the new love I now know how to show myself, I feel calm, secure, and most importantly, no longer needy.

I stopped seeking my wife entirely, no kisses, no hugs, no sweet words, and zero conversations initiated by me. If she wants to, she can do it, otherwise, I am no longer interested. I am happy with myself.

In the two weeks this has been happening, she hasn't complained about anything. This made me realize that my hypotheses regarding her type of attachment were correct.

After realizing this, I understood almost all the things that trigger me in my marriage and why, linking them to the traumas I experienced in the past.

I first tackled the issues of criticism and stonewalling.

I discovered that because of how my mother treated me and all the physical and verbal abuse from my stepfather (who hated me), I was always hyper-vigilant in trying to understand if I was in danger and if anyone wanted to harm or criticize me.

I suffered immensely reliving all this again, but I managed to understand why I was triggered, reasoned about why all this happened, tried to put myself in my mother’s and stepfather’s shoes to understand why they became the way they did (I know both of their childhood stories), and I have radically desensitized myself from this.

Without going into details, I told my wife that I resolved that one problem she always talked to me about, and to see the results in the following days.

In the following days, there were countless situations where I would normally have exploded and/or stonewalled, but I got through them calmly and unscathed, without being triggered. Even in important situations.

This made me happy because I realized how much my past was negatively impacting my present.

Unfortunately, although we no longer have frequent arguments with my wife, she hasn't had significant changes. I just saw her happier and calmer, but she hasn't changed at all. I had asked her before starting this journey if resolving this issue would make her the loving, present, in-love woman from 2008 again. She said yes, but I have yet to see any changes.

Some evenings she has come to hug me for barely 3 minutes, once she gave me a quick kiss calling me love, that's it.

It’s okay, at the moment the focus is that I need to heal.

What surprised me the most instead was the rapid response of my 4-year-old daughter. Becoming calmer and more confident, I saw a surge in her tranquility and happiness, and now she wants to play and spend time with me much more willingly. She immediately noticed the change and feels very secure with me. This filled me with joy, and I bonded even more with her.

Continuing the shadow work, I am now dealing with another theme: the constant arguments and rejections from my stepfather whenever I asked for something.

Every time I asked for something, like going out with friends, going to eat a pizza, playing soccer, or some money to buy a sandwich in the evening, there were always constant arguments where he said no, I had to fight with him, argue endlessly. Besides the many noes, he always repeated that the NOs were tied to things I hadn’t done or things I had done wrong. I won't go into details now because otherwise, this post would become too long, but believe me, he hated me to death and nearly drove me to suicide.

Reliving all this crap, I understood the dynamics in the relationship with my wife who, although she does a lot wrong, always tells me that everything depends on me and what I did/didn't do with her.

I am almost done addressing this aspect, the rejections from my stepfather, my inferiority, anxiety, low self-esteem, and little by little, I am discovering a sea of self-esteem, grit, determination, and anger that lies within me.

With my wife, I am becoming a different person: confident, strong, understanding her needs as well. In these two weeks, I have experienced a calm and serenity that I hadn’t felt in a long time. Zero arguments with my wife and zero dramas.

But unfortunately, there is a but.

As you know, we have a stressful situation with our daughter, and sometimes the days are very heated. Like 2 days ago.

In one of these, my wife verbally insulted me, using various bad words, but I confronted her (without using bad words or anything) that she can save that behavior for her street friends, not for me, her husband (I hadn’t done anything wrong in that situation). The next day we had another situation where she physically threatened to slap me, again I wasn’t scared but rather, a strong anger and desire to defend myself arose within me. I told her that she absolutely must not dare, and I no longer tolerate these things, I am not the same person anymore, and I am not afraid of her.

So my life now is really heated with many problems and changes happening, doing this shadow work hurts, but the results are there and are evident.

I am finally understanding myself, helping myself, my self-esteem is rebuilding, and it is drastically changing my family dynamics.

I am also going to the lawyer next week to clearly understand my situation and what a divorce would entail regarding my daughter, money, and other factors.

Finally, I am no longer afraid of being left or leaving my wife, which is what has held me back for 16 years from taking this step if necessary.

I’ll end with two things:

1. I hope to heal quickly, now that I am healing I can more easily recognize my wife's problems and how to help her. I aim to be at least 90% healed before explaining to her how I resolved my issues and what I am now.

2. Many of you criticized me for my Excel diary, but it was useful to do it, not so much for my wife, but for me. Now that I recognize my flaws, insecurities, fears, anxieties, and triggers, I know what to work on.

Until next time!

**Additional Information from OOP**

> **OOP:** I'm using the time to heal, having someone who triggers you helps you understand better yourself. Once I'm healed and I'm sure, I can proceed with the divorce with calm and serenity, if things don't improve. She needs to heal as well but now I'm not in the position to tell her anything or to expect anything, first I need to heal. If she decides that she is ok the way she is then a bye bye is guaranteed.

**OOP on what resources he used to deal with his trauma**

> **OOP:** Nothing specific, I'm just using a moleskine and a pen. I'm exploring my traumas with 5 questions:
1.	What am I doing right now? And I explain what triggers me, how, what are the emotions involved, what are the people involved. I try to be as honest as possible
2.	What are the past experiences that lead me to this behaviour? I explore my child trauma related to this behaviour, what happened, just stating facts I remember and connecting the dots
3.	Why this happened? Where I explore the people involved (mostly my mother and step father). I put myself in their shoes and understand their trauma and POV, so they no more are monsters now but simple grown children with traumas and issues. I then have compassion for them and I forgive them
4.	What did I understand? Where I reason on what I understood by answering the 3 questions above
5.	What do you want to say to yourself? Where I talk to myself and I hug myself and explain to myself that is ok to feel the way I feel, that I'm strong now, that I'm here for me

And then I feel ""free""

[Update #4](https://new.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1fki3oe/update_4_i_kept_a_diary_to_track_my_wifes/): **September 19, 2024**

It has been 7 days and I want to give you an update on how things are going.

The last post is this one -> https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ffe1mh/update_3_i_kept_a_diary_to_track_my_wifes/

I'll break it down into points to make it easier to read:

**1) My Healing Process**

It’s going really well, I’ve dealt with more issues from my childhood and all of this has given me incredible confidence and self-esteem.

After years of hating myself and calling myself awful names, I looked in the mirror and loved myself. I actually said: “I love you, and you are the most important person in my life. I love you exactly as you are, with your strengths and weaknesses.”

These were the words I always sought from a woman, but my wife never said or made me feel this way. I did it for myself.

Now that I’ve matured, I’ve become a man for the first time. I realized that no one was going to come help me and that it was all and only up to me. I understood that everything is my sole responsibility, and I alone can change what happens in my life.

From this moment on, when I have difficult and sad times because of my situation, I no longer end up in despair. I’m there to console myself and lift my spirits. This is so new for me that I’m genuinely happy for the first time in my life.

In the coming weeks, I’m tackling the remaining issues. I think I’ll be done in 1-2 weeks.

Why is everything progressing so quickly? Because I’m extremely clear about my problems, I have the will to descend into hell each time to face everything again, and I know how to proceed (I described it last time).

**2) Relationship with My Daughter**

My daughter is quickly understanding who’s taking control and leading this family. I’ve noticed that she has started to respect me more, look for me more, and trust me more. She is the one who’s grasping what’s happening the fastest.

I am falling more and more in love with my daughter, and I’m realizing how much my personal self-esteem issues were negatively impacting her life. Now that I’m healing, she’s healing too.

I’m over the moon about this.

**3) Relationship with Others**

I’ve stopped being a people-pleaser. I no longer care about looking nice, being agreeable, or thanking people too much.

Simple, precise, and well-formulated interactions without fear. I don’t even recognize myself.

Every time I act differently from the past, I feel a fire of self-esteem inside that confirms what I’ve resolved in my mind.

**4) Relationship with My Wife**

Obviously, it’s not going well, which shouldn’t come as a surprise. I’m discussing everything with my lawyer to prepare for the divorce (in my country, there are specific laws and situations to be aware of).

My wife is not taking the power shift well, but:

The disrespect has decreased. I no longer accept being yelled at in the face—it’s unacceptable.

After several times of trying to calm her down, she threatened me, saying that we need to talk about going our separate ways, that the chances she gave me have run out, that it’s necessary to separate for the common good, etc.

One particular day, she mentioned it several times in the afternoon, and I replied: “Okay, let’s talk. I agree; we should go our separate ways. I need a real woman who loves me. I don’t need to stay with you.”

Each time, she watched my reactions. By the evening, she was silent and didn’t say anything. Two days later, she said again that we should talk about separation, and I again said, “Okay, no problem.” This morning, she put on makeup (I ignored her) and came to give me a kiss, saying that for the sake of the family, we need to give the relationship another chance.

However, I have understood what happened and why I’m in this situation:

When we met, I was 18 years old and insecure. I felt ugly, lonely, and miserable in my family home and was desperately looking for a woman to be with.

She is very beautiful and probably, after two relationships with bad boy archetypes where she was treated poorly and many dates with people with healthy attachments who recognized her (avoidant attachment) and didn’t continue, she found me: an insecure, good guy with nice ideals to drain all the love and sweetness she could, offering me only her beauty and sex as a reward.

Without the need to invest herself, without the need to commit to this relationship.

I was very hurt to discover all of this, but we move forward. Sometimes I am angry with her, other times I think about how “broken” I was, and it was my fault too. But it doesn't matter; my healing process moves forward and takes precedence.

To remove further power from her, I told her that I no longer want to have sex with her. I don’t intend to let my mind get clouded by sex. I need a person who loves, esteems, and cares for me 24/7. Then sex happens because it is the cherry on top of all the love, not a tool to control me.

Until next time!

This election wasn’t lost because of your least favorite interest group,"In the coming days, dozens of post-mortems will be published trying to dissect why the Democrats lost. Fingers will be pointed everywhere, and more likely than not everyone will look for a myriad of reasons why the Democrats lost, be it certain issues, campaigns strategies, constituencies defecting, etc. This election will be viewed as a catastrophic failure of the Democratic Party on brand with 2004. Every commentator across the political spectrum will claim that had the Democrats just gone with their preferred strategy, then Kamala would be President-elect right now.

I think it’s safe to say that all of that is reading too much into it. The Democratic Party was in complete array. Progressives, liberals, moderates, centrists, whoever, fell in line behind Kamala as the candidate. Fundraising was through the roof, the ground game had a massive amount of energy and manpower in it, and Democratic excitement was palpable.

By all accounts, the Democrats showed up and showed out for this election across the board. Unfortunately, that isn’t enough. It kept the bottom from falling out like in 1972 or 1980, but the vast majority of independent and swing voters broke for the Republicans. A majority of the nation, for the first time in 20 years, put their faith in the governance of the Republican Party.

The median voter exists in an odd, contradictory vortex of mismatched beliefs and priors that cannot be logically discerned or negotiated. You just have to take them at their word. If they say they don’t like inflation, it’s because they believe that Biden is making the burgers more expensive. No amount of explaining why Trump’s economic policies are terrible, or why Biden’s policies were needed to avoid a massive post-COVID recession, or why they’re actually making a paycheck that offsets inflation, will win them over. 

In view of this, it was probably impossible for Kamala to win. She secured the Democratic base, made crossover appeals, and put forward some really good policies. And it worked. Her favorables are quite good, higher than Trump’s, and it’s obvious that she outperformed whatever Biden was walking into. Her campaign had flaws, certainly, but none nearly as obvious and grievous as Trump’s. 

Kamala being perceived as too liberal didn’t matter. The Democrats being too friendly to Israel (or not friendly enough) didn’t matter. Cultural issues didn’t matter. Jill Stein didn’t matter. Praising Dick Cheney didn’t matter. The reality of the American economy didn’t matter. If issue polling is correct, even immigration didn’t really matter, and is mostly viewed as a proxy for the economy. 

What mattered was that 67% of voters thought the economy was doing poorly, in spite of most of them thinking that their own financial situation was fine. Voters want to see a low price tag on groceries, a DoorDash fee of $10, and a 3,500 sq. ft. house on the market for $250k, even if it means 10% unemployment and low wages for workers. Of those things, they associate it most with Trump, as much of a mirage as that is, and were willing to accept everything else for the chance to have that back. This election isn’t a victory of all of Trumpism necessarily, or even a complete failure of the Democrats. It’s a reminder of the priorities of the voters that will decide the election, in spite of how good your campaign was, or how economically sound your actually policies were. There’s a hell of a lot that people will look past in order to have a cheap burger again.

If there is a failure, it’s that Democrats spent to long believing that there could ever be a return of civility and normality. There was a clear and evident reluctance to use the full power of the state against the insurrectionists and crooks, chief among them Donald Trump. Biden thought that he could restore the soul of the nation and get people to respect and value the unwritten rules of politics that have guided us through the current liberal era. As it turns out, voters don’t even care for the written ones.

Don’t blame the progressive, or the liberal, or the centrist Democratic voter. This election wasn’t really on them. They voted. They probably donated, walked the blocks, or did some phone banking. They did what they were supposed to. If liberalism is to weather the coming storm, it will need the tent to stay intact, readjust, and come back stronger for 2026 and 2028.

"March 7-9 Box Office Recap: 'Mickey 17' flops with an underwhelming $19 million domestically and a weak $53.3 worldwide total, against a $118 million budget. 'Ne Zha 2' crosses $2 billion in China.","https://preview.redd.it/aofa0t30pxne1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=367e3fc800286c66b0f76329f8703a94f53e9972

It was a very weak start for the month of March.

With incredibly weak competition, Bong Joon-ho's ***Mickey 17*** topped the box office, but it still proved to be the latest sci-fi flop at the box office. There were 3 other wide releases, all of which flopped as well. Needless to say, it was brutal.

The Top 10 earned a combined $49.2 million this weekend. That's an awful 62.4% drop from last year, when ***Kung Fu Panda 4*** topped the box office. This weekend is also barely up from last week, when there was just one wide release.

Opening at #1, WB's ***Mickey 17*** flopped with just $19 million in 3,807 theaters. These numbers are eerily similar to the box office failures of other sci-fi films like ***Jupiter Ascending*** ($18.3 million), ***Ad Astra*** ($19 million), and ***The Creator*** ($14 million). The only comfort is that it was Bong Joon-ho's biggest debut, but that's not saying much considering his prior films all opened in limited release. And it cost more than all his films ($118 million).

The failure of ***Mickey 17*** isn't surprising. There's a risk in opening a new sci-fi film, citing the failure of the previously mentioned titles. Even though ***Mickey 17*** is based on a book, it was treated as an original title anyway. So the film's disappointing numbers are another hit at the argument that audiences crave for new and original films.

Bong is popular with the cinephile audience; there was enormous interest in seeing what he would do after the colossal success of ***Parasite***. But it's been 5 years since that film won Best Picture, and it appears that the public moved on. This film was originally set for March 2024, but it faced many delays. WB reportedly spent $80 million in marketing the film, and while it properly sells the film, many were taken aback by the film's humor and tone. Even though this is consistent with Bong's films, perhaps the audience was expecting something more serious, as sci-fi comedies are very niche. 

This also brings up the topic of star power. Robert Pattinson is definitely popular, thanks to his roles in franchises like ***Harry Potter***, ***Twilight*** and ***The Batman***. But the thing is that his roles as leading man in non-IPs have not translated to box office success. Most of his films have been limited releases, and his last box office hit besides the three previously mentioned was ***Water for Elephants***, which came out back in 2011. This is not something exclusive to Pattinson, given that a lot of actors have struggled to open original titles. Reviews were positive (78% on RT), but not strong enough to convince those skeptical.

According to Warner Bros., 65% of the audience was male and 71% was 25 and over. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore, which is neither bad nor great. There's a strong chance ***Mickey 17*** could be front-loaded, given that its Thursday previews ($2.5 million) should've guaranteed a $20+ million debut and it fell far short of it. For now, a $50 million domestic total is likely for ***Mickey 17***, marking the latest box office misfire for WB.

After topping the box office for three weekends, ***Captain America: Brave New World*** had to go to second place. It dropped 44%, adding $8.3 million this weekend. That's a fine drop, although it would've been ideal if it happened far sooner. Through almost one month, the film has earned $176.4 million, and it should get close to $200 million. Better than its second weekend suggested, but still not really a win.

In third place, Focus Features' ***Last Breath*** dropped 48%, adding $4 million this weekend. Through ten days, the film has amassed $14.5 million so far, and it should finish with over $20 million by the end of its run.

In fourth place, Neon's ***The Monkey*** eased 39% this weekend, adding $3.9 million this weekend. The film has earned $31 million domestically, and it has already passed ***I, Tonya*** ($30 million) to become Neon's third highest film ever.

***Paddington in Peru*** had its best drop yet. It eased just 18% this weekend, adding $3.7 million. The film has earned $36.8 million, and it should close with around $45 million domestically.

DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** dipped a light 20%, earning $3.3 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $88.6 million so far, and it's fighting to hit the $100 million milestone.

After earning 5 Oscar wins, Best Picture winner ***Anora*** got expanded to 1,938 theaters. The film earned $1.8 million, taking its domestic total to $18.3 million. Quite impressive, considering it has been on digital platforms since December.

***Mufasa*** refuses to leave the Top 10. It eased just 16% this weekend, adding $1.6 million. With this, it has crossed $250 million domestically.

Angel Studios also opened ***Rule Breakers*** in 2,044 theaters, but it flopped with just $1.5 million. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing at over 2,000 theaters, and translates to a very poor $736 per-theater average. Even with an ""A"" on CinemaScore, this film will disappear quickly from theaters.

Rounding up the Top 10 was another flop. It was Paul W.S. Anderson's new film, ***In the Lost Lands***, which debuted with a meager $1 million in 1,370 theaters. That's Anderson's worst debut ever, even below ***Monster Hunter*** ($2 million), which came out during terrible conditions in December 2020. Expect this to fade quickly.

What's worse than 3 wide releases flopping? 4 wide releases flopping. Viva Pictures released ***Night of the Zoopocalypse*** into 1,400 theaters, but it earned just $804,370 this weekend. Pathetic.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mickey 17*** also made its appearance worldwide, but it was very unimpressive. The film debuted with $24.5 million overseas; adding its South Korean numbers from last week, the film has earned a weak $53.3 million worldwide. It had very soft debuts in France ($2.9M), the UK ($2.7M), Germany ($1.3M) and Mexico ($1.3M). Its biggest market, unsurprisingly, is South Korea with $14.6 million so far. With these numbers, it's clear ***Mickey 17*** won't be a box office success.

***Captain America: Brave New World*** has added $9.2 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $371 million. The best markets are the UK ($21.2M), Mexico ($14.5M), China ($14.3M), France ($12.8M) and South Korea ($11.2M). The film might actually cross $400 million, although it's still far from breaking even.

***Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy*** added $7.3 million, allowing it to cross $103.8 million in the overseas markets. Its best marekts are the UK ($51.1M), Australia ($8.6M), Netherlands ($5M), Poland ($4.8M) and Germany ($4.1M). 

Back in China, ***Ne Zha 2*** made history by crossing $2 billion in the country. In the process, it already passed ***Avengers: Infinity War*** to become the sixth highest grossing film worldwide.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Conclave* | Oct/25 | Focus Features | $6,601,995 | $32,580,655 | $104,360,856 | $20M

- ***Conclave*** has ended its run with a fantastic $104 million worldwide. That's a great result for an adult drama, and a sign that there's an audience for films like this. Whether you like the film or not, it's great that a film like this could find an audience instead of being sent to straight-to-streaming.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We've got three wide releases this weekend, and there's a strong chance that there won't be a single film hitting $10 million this weekend.

The first is Paramount's action comedy ***Novocaine***, which stars Jack Quaid as a bank executive with the inability to feel pain who goes out to rescue his coworker after she is taken hostage by a group of bank robbers. The film has already screened for critics, and reviews are quite solid (89% on RT). A possible sleeper hit?

The other release is Steven Soderbergh's newest film, Focus Features' ***Black Bag***. It stars Cate Blanchett, Michael Fassbender, Marisa Abela, Tom Burke, Naomie Harris, Regé-Jean Page, and Pierce Brosnan, and follows an intelligence agent who suspect his wife might be a traitor. Soderbergh is coming off ***Presence***, which made just $9.2 million, becoming one of his lowest grossing titles. Focus has emphasized action and intrigue, and the reviews are currently on fire (91% on RT), so this should have no problem in opening far higher.

Finally, there's ***The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie***. In a twist of fate, WB is not handling this movie, deciding to sell it off instead. The distributor is Ketchup Entertainment, a recent company that hasn't had box office success in the past few years. And it's unlikely this movie changes that trajectory.

This is not something exclusive to Pattinson, given that a lot of actors have struggled to open original titles. Reviews were positive (78% on RT), but not strong enough to convince those skeptical.

According to Warner Bros., 65% of the audience was male and 71% was 25 and over. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore, which is neither bad nor great. There's a strong chance ***Mickey 17*** could be front-loaded, given that its Thursday previews ($2.5 million) should've guaranteed a $20+ million debut and it fell far short of it. For now, a $50 million domestic total is likely for ***Mickey 17***, marking the latest box office misfire for WB.

After topping the box office for three weekends, ***Captain America: Brave New World*** had to go to second place. It dropped 44%, adding $8.3 million this weekend. That's a fine drop, although it would've been ideal if it happened far sooner. Through almost one month, the film has earned $176.4 million, and it should get close to $200 million. Better than its second weekend suggested, but still not really a win.

In third place, Focus Features' ***Last Breath*** dropped 48%, adding $4 million this weekend. Through ten days, the film has amassed $14.5 million so far, and it should finish with over $20 million by the end of its run.

In fourth place, Neon's ***The Monkey*** eased 39% this weekend, adding $3.9 million this weekend. The film has earned $31 million domestically, and it has already passed ***I, Tonya*** ($30 million) to become Neon's third highest film ever.

***Paddington in Peru*** had its best drop yet. It eased just 18% this weekend, adding $3.7 million. The film has earned $36.8 million, and it should close with around $45 million domestically.

DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** dipped a light 20%, earning $3.3 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $88.6 million so far, and it's fighting to hit the $100 million milestone.

After earning 5 Oscar wins, Best Picture winner ***Anora*** got expanded to 1,938 theaters. The film earned $1.8 million, taking its domestic total to $18.3 million. Quite impressive, considering it has been on digital platforms since December.

***Mufasa*** refuses to leave the Top 10. It eased just 16% this weekend, adding $1.6 million. With this, it has crossed $250 million domestically.

Angel Studios also opened ***Rule Breakers*** in 2,044 theaters, but it flopped with just $1.5 million. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing at over 2,000 theaters, and translates to a very poor $736 per-theater average. Even with an ""A"" on CinemaScore, this film will disappear quickly from theaters.

Rounding up the Top 10 was another flop. It was Paul W.S. Anderson's new film, ***In the Lost Lands***, which debuted with a meager $1 million in 1,370 theaters. That's Anderson's worst debut ever, even below ***Monster Hunter*** ($2 million), which came out during terrible conditions in December 2020. Expect this to fade quickly.

What's worse than 3 wide releases flopping? 4 wide releases flopping. Viva Pictures released ***Night of the Zoopocalypse*** into 1,400 theaters, but it earned just $804,370 this weekend. Pathetic.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mickey 17*** also made its appearance worldwide, but it was very unimpressive. The film debuted with $24.5 million overseas; adding its South Korean numbers from last week, the film has earned a weak $53.3 million worldwide. It had very soft debuts in France ($2.9M), the UK ($2.7M), Germany ($1.3M) and Mexico ($1.3M). Its biggest market, unsurprisingly, is South Korea with $14.6 million so far. With these numbers, it's clear ***Mickey 17*** won't be a box office success.

***Captain America: Brave New World*** has added $9.2 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $371 million. The best markets are the UK ($21.2M), Mexico ($14.5M), China ($14.3M), France ($12.8M) and South Korea ($11.2M). The film might actually cross $400 million, although it's still far from breaking even.

***Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy*** added $7.3 million, allowing it to cross $103.8 million in the overseas markets. Its best marekts are the UK ($51.1M), Australia ($8.6M), Netherlands ($5M), Poland ($4.8M) and Germany ($4.1M). 

Back in China, ***Ne Zha 2*** made history by crossing $2 billion in the country. In the process, it already passed ***Avengers: Infinity War*** to become the sixth highest grossing film worldwide.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Conclave* | Oct/25 | Focus Features | $6,601,995 | $32,580,655 | $104,360,856 | $20M

- ***Conclave*** has ended its run with a fantastic $104 million worldwide. That's a great result for an adult drama, and a sign that there's an audience for films like this. Whether you like the film or not, it's great that a film like this could find an audience instead of being sent to straight-to-streaming.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We've got three wide releases this weekend, and there's a strong chance that there won't be a single film hitting $10 million this weekend.

The first is Paramount's action comedy ***Novocaine***, which stars Jack Quaid as a bank executive with the inability to feel pain who goes out to rescue his coworker after she is taken hostage by a group of bank robbers. The film has already screened for critics, and reviews are quite solid (89% on RT). A possible sleeper hit?

The other release is Steven Soderbergh's newest film, Focus Features' ***Black Bag***. It stars Cate Blanchett, Michael Fassbender, Marisa Abela, Tom Burke, Naomie Harris, Regé-Jean Page, and Pierce Brosnan, and follows an intelligence agent who suspect his wife might be a traitor. Soderbergh is coming off ***Presence***, which made just $9.2 million, becoming one of his lowest grossing titles. Focus has emphasized action and intrigue, and the reviews are currently on fire (91% on RT), so this should have no problem in opening far higher.

Finally, there's ***The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie***. In a twist of fate, WB is not handling this movie, deciding to sell it off instead. The distributor is Ketchup Entertainment, a recent company that hasn't had box office success in the past few years. And it's unlikely this movie changes that trajectory.

I took in a lodger 4 months ago on a rolling month-to-month contract to help with cost of living. They have begun treating me like a slave, so I put my foot down and told them they have 6 weeks to move out. 

He has stated that this will not be happening, and sent a message to the WhatsApp group of a fake contract he has made that has ""my signature"" on it. He has told me that any attempt to move him out will mean trouble for me, but he hasn't put this in writing. 

So far my wife's ashes have gone missing, only for him to announce that he ""found the urn"" and it would be ""a shame if it got lost permenantly."" 

I really need help.

>He’s blackmailing you, and has tried to defraud you, call the police on them and have them removed immediately. For lodgers all you have to give them is reasonable notice, often this is a minimum of 24hrs-1 week but if there’s a threat to yours or your property’s safety, you can change the locks and ask them to leave immediately. It’ll be easier to do this with the police being there obviously, so you might want to save this until they come to question your lodger about the thefts/fraud etc.

Can't log into my previous account, but wanted to give an update. 

I took the advice from /r/LegalAdvice and attempted to do the following: 

*""In this order.* 

1. *Police report and pull together what information you have and give the police the date and time you will be having this Individual leave.* 

2. *Immediate notice is reasonable in this scenario you do not need six weeks more.* 

3. *Give the updated notice in writing for him to immediately quit the property and have a witness present when you deliver it. I would truly recommend having a few family or friends there as witnesses not just one person. Whilst his items are being removed also ensure everybody remains with you. If he refuses the notice and/or threatens you (as you will have witnesses, make sure one of them has their phone recording throughout if they can safely do so) call the police.* 

4. *Pre-arrange for the date a lock smith to come whilst your witnesses are there and do a full lock change so you can bolt the door once he has gone.* 

5. *You may wish to pop in some nest or similar cameras on the entrance etc in addition.* 

6. *You may also want a family member to stay a few nights afterwards just so you aren’t alone if he comes back.""* 

I went to the police station on the evening of my first post. I explained what was going on - that I had a lodger who was refusing to leave, and pretending that he was an actual tenant. 

Police agreed to return with me that evening for the eviction, but I had to wait close to 4 hours in the station. Whenever the officers arrived at my house the lodger opened the front door and spoke with the officers. He presented them with the fake contract, stating that he was renting this place, that I was the landlord, and that I was attempting an illegal eviction. 

At this point the police informed me that they didn't have enough evidence to make a decision on what amounted to a civil matter. I tried to enter my property, the lodger stopped me and said I was trespassing as a landlord legally has to give 24 hours notice if they wish to enter. 

The police sided with the lodger and informed me I would have to find alternative accommodation. 

I ended up having to stay in a dog-friendly BnB for a full week while I spoke with my homeowners insurance and my bank. I also tried to escalate with the police, but they refused to get involved in a civil matter. 

Upon returning to my property after a couple of days I discovered my keys no longer work, so it appears the lodger has changed the locks. 

I'm now living for free with a friend from my church while my home insurance is working with a solicitor (and hopefully my bank) to apply more pressure to the police to take action against the lodger. 

Not a happy situation at present, I'm afraid.

I have not been able to update earlier. 

Lodger has engaged in several dubious practices which makes it hard for eviction to continue. This includes: 

*  providing a fake name to me originally. So eviction documents were served on him with wrong name;
* getting court hearing delayed by feigning illness;
* Taking on his own lodgers/subtenants - a woman and young girl and signing them up for a 1 year rental contract in my home. 

My insurance company and solicitor work on this matter. Not easy. Not going well. 

Thank you to local Chinese community and kind local people as well for their support. The end is in sight and I will soon be back in my home.

In ""I Would Like To Solve the Puzzle - Roaring Kitty's 2024 Gamestop Play"", **I relied too heavily on my speculated narrative of various memes and tweets to try and create a story that fit GME's price movement.** I realized soon after I made that post that I could have unintentionally caused damage to innocent people who love the stock as much as we do and just love to buy it.

I believe that I and other GME lovers need to be **far more careful** when any public figure is brought into our speculation. After MOASS, the entire U.S. and possibly the world will be looking to us to blame. **We are completely innocent in this fucked up situation and I don't want to give any reason for the righteous fury of future economic victims to be steered towards the GME community.**

That being said, if by coincidence or sheer luck, I believe **I have finally understood why certain price action occurs for our favorite stock.**

I will be re-iterating some portions of my original post for context; however...

**I want this post to be far less focused on meme speculation and more focused on what I call ""FTD Settlement Period Limits"" and how we can use them to accurately predict price movement in the event of great and sudden purchase volume.**

# It's Not Delivery, It's DiGiorno! - Failure to Deliver

**Before Starting**

The T in T+X stands for **Trade Date. It is not to delineate Trading Days.**

The trade date is the date that you submit a purchase and it ""completes"" through your broker.

Anyone who is using C+35 for *any reason*, please **break that habit and start using T+35** when referring to Market Maker/Authorized Participant FTD settlements.

The difference between Calendar Days and Trade Days is related to the specific privilege given only to Market Makers and Authorized Participants. Only these massive institutions are given this exclusive 35 **Calendar** **Day** extension.

**Market Makers must follow the small player's Trade Date limits until they hit those limits. THEN they swap to a calendar day countdown that includes the previous calendar days they have already used up. 35 Calendar days and the pre-market following the 35th day (more on that below) is the absolute limit they can avoid buying shares from specific trade dates.**

**-**

First off, I want to immediately make a correction to my previous post.

In my first post, I relied on the format of T+35+Bank Holidays to explain price movements corresponding with possible large stock purchase dates.

**This format is incorrect. Bank Holidays are considered a normal calendar day. Market Makers/Authorized Participants do not receive extensions for each Bank Holiday.**

**\*Edit\*** The above statement is true; however, in the rare case of a large FTD settlement happening to land directly on a Bank Holiday, that *may* extend the FTD settlement period, or possibly even shorten it by that one day.

My previous thinking was that the entire point of the T+35 exemption time period was intended to allow more possible ""settlement"" days to be available for a Market Maker/Authorized Participant. It seemed counter intuitive for Bank Holidays to remove those possible settlement days. **However, I could not find any documentation confirming Bank Holidays further extend the T+35.** Therefore, I must assume that my previous format is **incorrect.**

So what does this change? Actually, almost nothing. **In fact, this allowed me to finally understand what is going on with this stock.** Let me explain why.

It turns out I missed a crucial factor regarding the T+35 Market Maker/Authorized Participant settlement exemption period:

>*...the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than* ***the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date***\*, referred to as T+4...\*

Source: Rule 204 of Regulation SHO [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm)

In simplified terms, Market Makers and Authorized Participants have until the end of **Pre-Market on the morning following the settlement period limit.** T+3 is the last day of **Regular Trading Hours** that they can purchase; however, they are allowed to instead use **Pre-Market of the following day.** The SEC refers to this special privilege as T+4 even though its really more like T+3 and 1/2 or even less. (Extra note, I swear it feels like the SEC still uses T+3 almost everywhere else when talking about settlement for MMs and APs. I don't know what is up with that.)

**This also applies to their T+35 day limit as the Pre-Market of the next trade day following their 35 days is NOT considered ""regular trading hours.""**

The full **(albeit very simplified)** Market Maker/Authorized Participant's flow chart for a purchase would look like this:

>Purchase order comes into the Market Maker's queue from a Broker

>Market Maker does not buy the share that day

>3 Trading Days pass.

>Market Maker can choose to purchase in Pre-Market of the following Trade Day but decides **not** to. The limit is then pushed to T+6.

>3 more Trading Days pass.

>Market Maker can choose to purchase in Pre-Market on the following Trade Day but decides not to.

>Market Maker now enters T+35 special extension. All of the previous calendar days that have passed since the Trade Date retroactively count towards this 35 calendar day count.

>The 35th calendar day has arrived, the Settlement Period Limit has nearly been reached. The Market Maker REALLY doesn't want to buy that share.

>Market Maker pushes it to the very last moment by NOT purchasing on Calendar day 35. **Instead, they buy during Pre-Market on the next Trading Day.**

\*EDIT\* The flowchart above uses ""Market Maker"" in place of the actual counterparties. In reality, these FTDs are most likely being passed from counterparty to counterparty further up the chain until it lands on the Market Maker's queue after Pre-Market of T+6. Since extending to T+35 seems to be the default behavior for shorting Gamestop through ETFs like XRT, I simplified the flowchart by just inserting the Market Maker.

Let me show you an even more simple example of this flowchart on the *actual* chart. I will only bother using T+35. Why not? That's all the Market Makers seem to use.

The start dates for this period are as follows:

3/28, 4/1, 4/2 all in 2024.

We can calculate the Settlement Period Limit using T+35 and throw in Pre-Market for each date.

5/2-3(Pre-Market), 5/3-4(Pre-Market), 5/7-8(Pre-Market) all in 2024.

[Small Price Settlement Period 3\/28-4\/2 Through To 5\/2-5\/8 \(Pre-Market\)](https://preview.redd.it/ifbbv8yynj7d1.png?width=1896&format=png&auto=webp&s=633d6b9b1e88994af86fecaad804c285671ac179)

The price scale may be small, but the percentage gain is impressive over this 35 day period.

On the left we have an extended downtrend in the price over a multi day period. 35 calendar days later we have a large upward movement. **You might be thinking that the upward movement seems too large for those 3 days of FTDs, but FTDs are only half of the puzzle**. I'll explain the second half in the next section.

For most of us that have trouble with chart analysis it may be difficult to spot normal(ish) price action vs a spike in Naked Shorting that leads to FTD accumulation. For anyone that is interested in looking into the past, I would suggest looking for an extended multi-day period of price dropping. If there is a multi-day *harsh* downtrend on no news/announcements, **there is a higher chance that they are just refusing to complete a large portion of buy orders over those days.**

To wrap this section up, I will leave the entire Rule 204 of Regulation SHO here for you:

>*Rule 204 — Close-out Requirements.* Under Rule 204, participants of a registered clearing agency (as defined in section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act) must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date, or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows: the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4; if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona-fide market making activities, the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in “threshold securities” if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Threshold securities, as defined by Rule 203(c)(6), are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver.

Source: [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm)

And here is the SECs very poor attempt at an ELI5:

>Rule 204 provides an extended period of time to close out certain failures to deliver. Specifically, if a failure to deliver position results from the sale of a security that a person is deemed to own and that such person intends to deliver as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed, the firm has up to 35 calendar days following the trade date to close out the failure to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity. Such additional time is warranted and does not undermine the goal of reducing failures to deliver because these are sales of owned securities that cannot be delivered by the settlement date due solely to processing delays outside the seller’s or broker-dealer’s control. Moreover, delivery is required to be made on such sales as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed and situations where a person is deemed to own a security are limited to those specified in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO. A common example of a deemed to own security that cannot be delivered by the settlement date is a security subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933.

# Settlers of Catan - Gamma Ramp

In the previous small price example, the price increase after T+35 seemed to far outweigh the price loss from Naked Shorting. Why is that?

It was due to two major factors.

1. **Bull's Entry Point** - Gamestop's stock had experienced a major downtrend over several years. Volume was miniscule as the price had reached an extreme low of near $10 (Post-Split). This, along with several other TA indicators alerted both small and large investors that **Gamestop's stock was at a perfect entry point to buy back in.**

[Close-To-Perfect Entry Point Was The Week of 4\/20\/2024 \(lmao\)](https://preview.redd.it/dy2miajmrj7d1.png?width=1897&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6f950c9872c3ead790d9e94d0dd4bee872496d)

2. **More Investors = More Options = Gamma Ramp -** Both small and large investors began scooping up call options for absurdly low prices. More open call contracts causes the *potential* for increased options hedging.

But, depending on the strike prices chosen, the price won't drastically rise on it's own. If the price doesn't rise enough, the Options writers won't need to hedge which means a Gamma ramp isn't going to happen on it's own. **It needs a spark to ignite it.**

**That is where the real power of FTDs is on display and this why the Market Makers and Authorized Participants naked shorting Gamestop are in DEEP shit.**

Let's have a look at that first example again but this time let's double check the dates of the Settlement Period Limit.

[5\/1-5\/3 = Wednesday - Friday](https://preview.redd.it/39ly2gfntj7d1.png?width=1896&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b108d060a3aee986467619cd94c8af88af8ca65)

It is my opinion that we are looking at a mini gamma ramp triggered by a higher-than-normal amount of options contracts being pushed Into-The-Money by FTD settlement.

Market Makers are being forced to settle their FTDs leading right into the **end of week options expiration.** Thousands of options are pushed ITM due to the abnormal purchase volume from the FTD settlement. More options being pushed further ITM causes Options Writers to purchase more shares to hedge for their potential losses causing a Gamma Squeeze. **This is how a ""small"" amount of FTDs can have a massive impact on price.** And it is exactly what we saw in January of 2021.

[Ryan Cohen's 12\/17-12\/18 Purchase Settles](https://preview.redd.it/fx7nhopn2l7d1.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=06939c751f0d27f4b6ee29af63c991831aaa7298)

Ryan Cohen saw Gamestop as a possible turnaround story and pursued a stake in the Company.

His purchase Trade Dates are as follows:

12/17/2020 - Purchased 470,311 (Split Adjusted = 1,881,244)  
12/18/2020 - Purchased 500,000 (Split Adjusted = 2,000,000)  
12/18/2020 - Purchased 256,089 (Split Adjusted = 1,024,356)

Totals: 1,226,400 (Split Adjusted = 4,905,600)

Source: [https://fintel.io/n/cohen-ryan](https://fintel.io/n/cohen-ryan)

T+35 Calendar days from 12/17 and 12/18 would place his FTD settlement period limit at 1/21-23(Pre-Market)

Above you can see the sudden upward movement of the stock followed by an explosive price change. on January 23rd, 2020 in Pre-market.

Here are the values:

1/21/2021 - Opened at $9.81 Closed at $10.76 | Percentage Gain From Previous Close: 10.02%  
1/22/2021- Opened at $10.65 | Closed at $16.25 | Percentage Gain From Previous Close: **51.03%**  
1/23/2021 - Settlement Period Limit reached at 9:29am EST. Price opened at $24.18 | Percentage Gain From Previous Close: **48.8%**

*Edit* Fixed the years above to 2021 to correctly reflect sneeze date.

**Market Maker's ABUSE of Failure-To-Delivers via Naked Short Selling caused Ryan Cohen's purchase to be delayed until January 21-23(Pre-Market).** As thousands upon thousands of options contracts were pushed Into-The-Money, Options Writers **continued buying more and more shares to hedge their losses.** This created an extremely volatile trading day as millions upon millions of shares were quickly traded due to countless options contracts being **closed and re-opened.**

Okay but what about The Cycle™?

Ryan Cohen's purchase in to Gamestop may have inadvertently kicked off this whole saga, **but why did the stock have a pattern of jumps throughout these last 3+ years before April?**

Well, I can give you an example that will hopefully help us to understand this ""Cycle"" pattern.

[January 19th and 20th - February 23rd, 24th, and 25th \(Pre-Market\)](https://preview.redd.it/dhnspkx65k7d1.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fe7181e68d54bcb87fa6c422a26ff1fef302e69)

January 19th, 2021 was a Monday following a drastic price jump that Gamestop had not seen for a VERY long time. The week of January 11th, the stock opened at $4.85(Post-Split) it closed the week at $8.88(Post-Split). **That is an 83% gain from open on Monday to close on Friday.**

It would be speculation to say that there may have been emergency calls/meetings held for these Market Makers and Authorized Participants; however, **I can confidently guess that the decision was made to open the following week HARD on Naked Shorting.** Monday and Tuesday (1/19 and 1/20), the price hardly moved as this shorting occurred. Hardly any shares were purchased by the Market maker to cover any non-options related orders. **Bear in mind volume was over 100 million shares each day that week (Post-Split).**

Once the FTDs from Ryan Cohen's purchase came due, millions of shares had to be purchased sending the stock price higher and higher. Options Writers quickly began purchasing more and more shares to hedge their losses. The resulting Gamma Squeeze sent the stock **parabolic**.

As soon as the momentum from the Gamma Squeeze was exhausted, mass options sell offs occurred beginning a general down trend; however, Market Makers were not happy with a ""general downtrend."" They needed Gamestop dropped and fast.

[January 29th and February 1st Incredible Naked Shorting](https://preview.redd.it/3untl3ez7k7d1.png?width=1635&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b13b30b81ae35353ac0693584fb3b43f89b011f)

**The buy button was removed and the fall from the Gamma Squeeze was so absurdly quick that even** ***amateur*** **investors could tell something HISTORICALLY criminal just occurred.**

Any short institution with a stake in Gamestop that COULD Naked Short this stock did so through it's entire fall after the initial Gamma Squeeze.

With fewer brokers able to purchase Gamestop due to the Clearing House restriction put in place just after the Gamma Squeeze peak, institutions at lower levels waited for their usual T+3 settlement limit hoping to buy at a lower price point. Market Makers and Authorized Participants Naked Shorted every share they could creating a massive ball of FTDs on a T+35 Calendar Day clock. **All this effort to stop the stock from resting at a MUCH higher base price and to prevent margin calls from forcing them to close long dated short positions.**

Their collusion worked temporarily as the price plummeted back to the low price of around $10 (Post Split). This most likely allowed them time to breath and re-position to survive what came next. Their extension for FTDs expired and the stock rocketed back up due to their required buy ins scheduled for late February.

**Each subsequent run up and run down is a re-run of this exact situation played at a slightly smaller scale each time.** Over time as more and more public investors (large, small, and institutional) lose interest/hope for the stock, less and less purchases are made and fewer shares need to be marked as FTD. Eventually, Market makers managed to return the stock to a very low price and have relative control over it's movement. **That is, until 2024.**

Due to my understanding of the initial Gamma Squeeze in 2021 and it's subsequent run ups:

**I believe that the key to Gamestop's release from the unlawful PRISON that is ABUSIVE naked shorting is the occurrence of multiple back-to-back gamma ramps each ignited by the Market Maker's Failure to Deliver abuse.**

# Entering The Volume - Volume Inflation

I believe this has already been covered, but I wanted to create a small section just as a *reminder* of why Gamestop has such absurd levels of volume over the course of months.

We have often seen mentions of the volume easily exceeding the available float of Gamestop's shares. **A big reason for that is due to FTDs. Every single FTD counts as a minimum of 2 volume per share.**

When an investor purchases shares through a Broker, they are added to that day's volume. The purchaser is told they have the shares in their account even though the purchase has not affected the price value. T+35 days later, the Market Maker will *actually* purchase the share, adding 1 to the volume for the day they purchased it.

This causes Gamestop's volume to inflate on a larger time scale. Looking at 3 months of volume, you will be unknowingly seeing **a portion of volume that has been doubled** due to FTD settlement.

# Dark - The Future of the Cycle

Earlier, I mentioned that Bullish investors were buying back into Gamestop in late April.

Gamestop's stock is on an uptrend and is garnering more interest from the pool of public investors. The more momentum Gamestop's stock has, the more purchasing occurs which means **more FTDs accumulating.** **If these FTDs happen to line up correctly,** they may reach their Settlement Period Limit later in the month, specifically on the 3rd Friday the **week of options and futures expirations.**

>*Triple witching hour is the last hour of the stock market trading session (3:00-4:00 P.M., New York City local Time) on the third Friday of every March,* ***June***\*, September, and December. Those days are the expiration of three kinds of securities:\*

>

>*Stock market index futures;*

>*Stock market index options;*

>*Stock options.*

>*The simultaneous expirations generally increases the trading volume of options, futures, and their underlying stocks, occasionally increasing the volatility of prices of related securities.*

Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple\_witching\_hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_witching_hour)

**The FTD purchasing along with Options and Futures contracts expiring could compound into a massive Gamma Squeeze of a similar or even larger movement than the original 2021 Sneeze.**

All that it would need is a decent amount of FTDs' Settlement Period Limits **to coincide with the same week if we were lucky, maybe the same DAY** if we were here for a *reckoning*.

But for that, we would need large investors with 100's of millions of dollars to buy into Gamestop all because they believe it is a great investment opportunity.

**Thankfully, we have possibly the most downright insane investor on Gamestop's side, DeepFuckingValue** AKA Roaring Kitty. Roaring Kitty may be crazy (aren't we all?), but he is also an *incredibly* smart trader.

\*SPECULATION AHEAD\*

I believe that DFV has taken advantage of the recent run-up/run-down to further his position and he MAY have made a large purchase 5/16/2024 while the stock was heading down from a recent large movement.

[May 16th DFV Possible Re-Entry After Selling April Calls](https://preview.redd.it/3ssfyiv1ek7d1.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df6e1e9ce17d929d4e0809697715ac5dbe58ee2)

*""E\*Trade Considers Kicking Meme-Stock Leader Keith Gill Off Platform""*

[https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/e-trade-considers-kicking-meme-stock-leader-keith-gill-off-platform-f2003ec4](https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/e-trade-considers-kicking-meme-stock-leader-keith-gill-off-platform-f2003ec4)

In the above article (pay-walled, sorry), E-Trade has potentially broken Broker-to-Trader privacy regulations and leaked that DFV had purchased options previous to his social media return.

Due to the timing of Roaring Kitty's memes this year, it is my belief that DFV DID purchase options in April and sold them at or near the peak of May 15th. He then used the profits from that sale to purchase shares on the way down on 5/16/2024.

On Roaring Kitty's stream, he showed off how accurate the bull flag was to the bottom of the original Gamestop 2021 Sneeze. I believe that **Roaring Kitty predicted the stock would eventually bottom out to around this same price and chose a price near** **the bottom as his re-entry price.**

[\\""This is all a Test\\"" - Roaring Kitty most likely referring to \\""Testing Support\\"" on the Gamestop chart](https://preview.redd.it/ea6xhihjik7d1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a19547faed16aff5af32ff62dd7621f3e3c0218)

**I speculate that Roaring Kitty entered into additional positions slightly above the support level of $10.**

Trading done in the previous 3 years as well as this new position would have his cost basis be **substantially** lowered from his original $55.17. He has purchased 4.8 million shares in the past 3 years and **we know that he averaged down HARD.**

It is possible that DFV purchased a large portion of his 5 Million shares near the bottom. If true, his purchase must have been large enough that Market Makers and Authorized Participants did **NOT** want to fulfill the order immediately. Instead, they used their T+35 Calendar Day special exemption to extend their delivery time.

At some point either slightly before or after his purchase, DFV decided that the stock has *definitely* bottomed out and he then loaded up on call options to take advantage of the eventual upward movement.

This leads us to the May run up. DFV's original stock purchase slightly above Gamestop's support line has now come due T+35 days later. The FTDs are settled for what could potentially be millions of share purchases. The purchases drive investor's options In-The-Money, sparking a Gamma Squeeze. DFV notices the price action, sells his options purchase near the peak and tries to find a good entry point as the stock is moving down after the Gamma Squeeze is exhausted.

My theory is that he **MAY** have made a purchase on May 16th 2024 as the math on his current cost basis could be averaging up after his large purchase in April.

I am using this tool to do very basic math for the cost basis:

[https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/stock-average](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/stock-average)

Just as one example: In April, if DFV had managed to purchase the majority of his large position at $16, that would allow for a new purchase on May 16th at $28 to create a VERY similar cost basis of $21.33 vs his original June 2024 cost basis of $21.27. That is a $.06 difference while only using round price points for exit and entry.

I personally believe that DFV could have purchased in April at an even lower price point. The lower you use for his April purchase, the higher he may have purchased on May 16th.

*Disclaimer: Calculating cost basis is not as simple as I am depicting. This is just a scarcely detailed example to get my point across that this is a potential timeline of events. I am also did* ***not*** *try to perfectly re-create DFV's entire purchase history, I just used recent purchases to illustrate my point.*

**But why does any of this matter?**

Because if Roaring Kitty DID purchase on May 16th, it may have been a **substantial** purchase. Far too large for Market Makers or Authorized Participants to move off exchange. They clearly have a history of just delaying the purchase, so I am willing to bet that they have Naked Shorted here again. T+35 from May 16th, 2024 is June 20th, 2024. Market Makers are allowed to further extend the deadline until Pre-Market of the next day, June 21st, 2024.

**We have potentially been gifted a massive run-up on June 21st by Market Makers and Authorized Participants' extreme abuse of FTDs via Naked Short Selling. All of this because one small cat LOVES this damn stock.**

# Exercise Machine - Exercising VS Purchasing

*This topic was included in my original post. I will be adding an edited version and including it here for important context.*

I see many people going back and forth on whether DFV purchased shares directly or exercised some of his call options on June 13th, 2024.

I am here to tell you **he almost certainly did not exercise.**

Enough time has passed for us to know with near certainty that he has not exercised.

Per the Options Clearing Corporation:

>If it's an equity or ETF weekly option, exercise notices tendered on any business day will result in delivery of the underlying shares on the second (T+2)\* business day following exercise. Index options are cash-settled on the next business day following exercise.

*Edit* I think the OCC website was updated just today to reflect CAT changes. Options exercise delivery is now T+1.

Exercising options is very different from purchasing stock directly and apes are wise to recognize that purchasing options and exercising them allows retail to **actually affect the market price directly.** It essentially bypasses the T+35 day waiting period for our purchase to hit the market. To my knowledge, they do not and cannot delay settlement past T+2 for per options regulating restrictions.

However, DFV's transaction on June 13th would have **definitely** hit the market by now.

Since we have seen next to no upward pressure since his purchase, I would assume that he instead sold his options for cash on June 12th. The updated Open Interest dropped by a massive amount after market close. Roaring Kitty then posted his Dune tweet at 2PM EST on June 13th, and in my opinion, this is him excitedly posting that he just purchased the 4,001,000 shares. Can't imagine what that feels like. After hours on June 13th, DFV then posted his updated position confirming that he holds 4,001,000 additional shares.

If you need more solid evidence that DFV did **NOT** exercise, here is Dave Lauer's tweets with another user stating that they view this as an options sale to purchase more shares. Please remember Dave has been in the industry for **years**. Yes, he can make mistakes, but he is **NOT** an amateur investor trying to spread FUD.

[Dave Lauer on DFV's new Yolo](https://preview.redd.it/micri3ifpk7d1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6c03dced340a90f938b157178d37e586fa9c848)

A large part of the discussion seems to center around Premium cost factoring into cost basis.

**Dave's years of trading experience has led him to believe that Options Premium costs are not factored into your cost basis, only the Option's Strike Price.**

So a trader reached out to DFV's Broker, E-Trade, to clarify if they factor in a premium cost to a position's cost basis in your account position portal.

[E-Trade Does NOT Factor in Premiums to Cost Basis](https://preview.redd.it/pucdpmdypk7d1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=80708afd66cb414e55aaa0e7ce2bf59d2d36159a)

**E-Trade reported that they ONLY use the Options Strike Price to adjust your Cost Basis.**

**DFV** ***almost certainly\**** **did NOT exercise his call options.**

**\*EDIT\* \***  
Several of you have reached out to me with doubts regarding E-Trade factoring in premiums for options cost basis. I agree with all of you that it seems like an odd choice to leave them out. So I wanted to include my opinion here:

In my mind, the chances of DFV exercising vs purchasing direct stock are at *least* an equal stalemate.

The math on his cost basis can be reached in either situation, so we need to look at other variables to make a decision.

If DFV exercised early, he lost out on many days of theta value. Selling his calls and then buying directly would net him *substantially* more shares than exercising too early. In the past, DFV has exercised his options by allowing them to expire ITM. It is my personal view that, if he wanted to exercise while the price action was relatively normal, he would have used this same method of allowing them to expire ITM.

Some people will say that his decision to exercise early was a part of some plan; however, T+1 has passed for the Exercised Securities Settlement Period Limit and nothing has happened. If exercising was his plan, it did not seem to work.

>**Exercise Settlement Time:**  Exercise notices tendered on any business day will result in delivery of the underlying stock on the first (T+1) business day following exercise.

It is my personal opinion that DFV *does* have a plan to ride out the 2024 Gamestop action and selling his calls to buy the most shares possible seems to benefit him the most.

Coincidentally, it also can benefit us.



Since DFV is a trader that loves to interact with a community, he often **publicly posts his positions**. Now that DFV is a *whale,* a direct stock purchase that he makes on the market is almost *guaranteed* to be **millions of shares of FTDs**. With knowledge of the date of his purchase, we can make an estimate on when his purchase will *actually* affect the share price and take a position in the stock to benefit off of it. This unique set of circumstances is ONLY possible because one MASSIVE whale LOVES this stock *and* **Market Makers and Authorized Participants are ILLEGALY ABUSING THEIR RIGHTS TO NAKED SHORT.**

DFV's *near confirmed* June purchase date is June 13th, 2024.

**T+35 Calendar Days would put his direct stock purchase hitting the market on July 18th. However, Market Makers will most likely wait until the last minute by pushing it to Pre-Market of Friday, July 19th, 2024.**

I personally believe that DFV's *unconfirmed* May purchase date is May 16th, 2024,

**T+35 Calendar Days would put his direct stock purchase hitting the market on June 20th. However, Market Makers will most likely wait until the last minute by pushing it to Pre-Market of Friday, June 21st, 2024.**

# Conclusion - On the Shoulders of Giants

Thank you to anyone that stuck through and read this post!

The Gamestop saga is one **hell** of a ride and I personally cannot wait for GME to break free of it's Naked Short prison and fly free.

It is impossible for me to list everyone who has contributed DD to Superstonk but I am completely serious when I say that I am standing on the shoulders of absolute **GIANTS.** And those giants are standing on other giants ~~that are standing on other giants that also stand on giants that are all standing on Rick of Spades.~~

Seriously, 5 years ago if you told me that I would be spending time the equivalent of a full workday to write about this kind of shit in the stock market, I would have asked you to leave me alone.

Over three years of DD and chart watching must have formed a nice new wrinkle in my ape brain and that is thanks to all of you here at Superstonk.

**My understanding of this situation may need additional expanding or some small corrections; however, I believe I have at least nailed down what has caused this stock to behave so bizarrely starting from January 2021.**

**-**

With all of that said, I would like to put money in mouth:

[doxxed my account number because I am truly regarded. Edited Position Picture](https://preview.redd.it/hkk0dx1ndl7d1.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=38d3a7ea51e8a43fab386f1d0309f1bfc2e01ec8)

**This ugly fucking nightmare of a position is mine.**

I currently have 2,200 shares worth of leverage. I also have a bit more buying power left. Assuming the price stays relatively low on Thursday, I plan to purchase additional contracts for June 21st.

I want to make one thing **VERY** clear:

June 21st may or MAY NOT run up due to an FTD Settlement Period Limit+Gamma Hedging Squeeze.

I am LESS confident about June 21st than I am about July 19th.

The July 19th date is based off of two *nearly confirmed* data points: DFV publicly posted that he purchased a large amount of shares on June 13th, 2024. Even though we cannot be *absolutely* sure he purchased them *on that day* I believe due to his past posts, that **he is honest with the community**.

June 21st only has my ***best estimate*** of DFV's May purchase. **If my guess is wrong, I could lose all of the money I have poured into premiums for that ugly bastard of an options position that I call my own.**

Purchasing 1-2 Day To Expiry Options Contracts is historically a DumbFuckingMove™ and I do NOT recommend following me into **this risky as hell gamble.**

If you *are* like me and believe that the FTD Settlement Limit Periods are driving the stock movement, **it would be MUCH safer to bet on July 19th, 2024** as we have a much better idea of the exact purchase date our resident whale bought his shares on. I even have a small amount of money set aside as a backup in case my May purchase date theory is wrong and I will use that to essentially YOLO into July 19th, 2024 Expiry, or possibly the week after, July 26th, 2024.

*EDIT* Wanted to add this. PLEASE be aware how risky June 21st options are. The company completed a MASSIVE share offering in the middle of my May-June timeline. It is entirely possible that Market Makers used this offering to offset FTD settlement. It is also possible that Market Makers doubled down and added additional Naked Shorts during this offering. This is gamble I am taking.

Some have asked me how I feel about DRS. I will let this speak for itself:

[I deeply regret not YOLOing in for more shares during the $10-$12 dollar range...](https://preview.redd.it/0wo8u04xal7d1.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3d86705507f339f9ba1e77e9dc2b2a809ab8521)

I could not find a good spot to fit this into the post, but I did want to remind everyone that June 21st 2024 is the farthest dated LEAPS from January 2021. This may be an additional factor to consider as, anyone that was trying to reposition their options contracts *may* have chosen the farthest available date on the chain.

Oh and a neat trick I learned the other day...

As long as you have enough cash in your Options trading account, In-The-Money Options contracts **automatically exercise** by 5PM on the expiration date. (At least for Fidelity.)

I thought that was kind of neat.

**SMALL ASIDE REGARDING FTD DATA RELEASES**

The adjustments of my prediction for DFV's may purchase **completely invalidates** my previous theory about FTD reporting in my last post ""I Would Like To Solve the Puzzle - T+3, T+6, T+35"".

If I had to guess at why our FTD data is pretty much a crapshoot, I would reach for the utterly *classic* line of ""this data is self reported and cannot be fully relied upon."" *\*chefs kiss\**

Those missing days are most likely just days that reported 0 FTDs for that day. Whether you believe that they are reporting honestly is up to you.

Last, but not least. I thought to include my favorite song for all of you. Hopefully it will get you guys excited for Friday and remind you of all we are doing here in Superstonk.

# INTRO

Happy Juneteenth Superstonk.

I am the OP of ""I Would Like To Solve the Puzzle - Roaring Kitty's 2024 Gamestop Play"" and ""I Would Like To Solve the Puzzle - T+3, T+6, T+35"".

I am back with some minor corrections to my initial posts. **Don't worry, if you read my last posts my future date predictions are still the same.**

Many of you have reached out to me directly asking why I have removed my previous posts. I don't want to get into all of the reasons but I do want to clarify for you:

In ""I Would Like To Solve the Puzzle - Roaring Kitty's 2024 Gamestop Play"", **I relied too heavily on my speculated narrative of various memes and tweets to try and create a story that fit GME's price movement.** I realized soon after I made that post that I could have unintentionally caused damage to innocent people who love the stock as much as we do and just love to buy it.

I believe that I and other GME lovers need to be **far more careful** when any public figure is brought into our speculation. After MOASS, the entire U.S. and possibly the world will be looking to us to blame. **We are completely innocent in this fucked up situation and I don't want to give any reason for the righteous fury of future economic victims to be steered towards the GME community.**

That being said, if by coincidence or sheer luck, I believe **I have finally understood why certain price action occurs for our favorite stock.**

I will be re-iterating some portions of my original post for context; however...

**I want this post to be far less focused on meme speculation and more focused on what I call ""FTD Settlement Period Limits"" and how we can use them to accurately predict price movement in the event of great and sudden purchase volume.**

# It's Not Delivery, It's DiGiorno! - Failure to Deliver

**Before Starting**

The T in T+X stands for **Trade Date. It is not to delineate Trading Days.**

The trade date is the date that you submit a purchase and it ""completes"" through your broker.

Anyone who is using C+35 for *any reason*, please **break that habit and start using T+35** when referring to Market Maker/Authorized Participant FTD settlements.

The difference between Calendar Days and Trade Days is related to the specific privilege given only to Market Makers and Authorized Participants. Only these massive institutions are given this exclusive 35 **Calendar** **Day** extension.

**Market Makers must follow the small player's Trade Date limits until they hit those limits. THEN they swap to a calendar day countdown that includes the previous calendar days they have already used up. 35 Calendar days and the pre-market following the 35th day (more on that below) is the absolute limit they can avoid buying shares from specific trade dates.**

**-**

First off, I want to immediately make a correction to my previous post.

In my first post, I relied on the format of T+35+Bank Holidays to explain price movements corresponding with possible large stock purchase dates.

**This format is incorrect. Bank Holidays are considered a normal calendar day. Market Makers/Authorized Participants do not receive extensions for each Bank Holiday.**

**\*Edit\*** The above statement is true; however, in the rare case of a large FTD settlement happening to land directly on a Bank Holiday, that *may* extend the FTD settlement period, or possibly even shorten it by that one day.

My previous thinking was that the entire point of the T+35 exemption time period was intended to allow more possible ""settlement"" days to be available for a Market Maker/Authorized Participant. It seemed counter intuitive for Bank Holidays to remove those possible settlement days. **However, I could not find any documentation confirming Bank Holidays further extend the T+35.** Therefore, I must assume that my previous format is **incorrect.**

So what does this change? Actually, almost nothing. **In fact, this allowed me to finally understand what is going on with this stock.** Let me explain why.

It turns out I missed a crucial factor regarding the T+35 Market Maker/Authorized Participant settlement exemption period:

>*...the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than* ***the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date***\*, referred to as T+4...\*

Source: Rule 204 of Regulation SHO [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm)

In simplified terms, Market Makers and Authorized Participants have until the end of **Pre-Market on the morning following the settlement period limit.** T+3 is the last day of **Regular Trading Hours** that they can purchase; however, they are allowed to instead use **Pre-Market of the following day.** The SEC refers to this special privilege as T+4 even though its really more like T+3 and 1/2 or even less. (Extra note, I swear it feels like the SEC still uses T+3 almost everywhere else when talking about settlement for MMs and APs. I don't know what is up with that.)

**This also applies to their T+35 day limit as the Pre-Market of the next trade day following their 35 days is NOT considered ""regular trading hours.""**

The full **(albeit very simplified)** Market Maker/Authorized Participant's flow chart for a purchase would look like this:

>Purchase order comes into the Market Maker's queue from a Broker

>Market Maker does not buy the share that day

>3 Trading Days pass.

>Market Maker can choose to purchase in Pre-Market of the following Trade Day but decides **not** to. The limit is then pushed to T+6.

>3 more Trading Days pass.

>Market Maker can choose to purchase in Pre-Market on the following Trade Day but decides not to.

>Market Maker now enters T+35 special extension. All of the previous calendar days that have passed since the Trade Date retroactively count towards this 35 calendar day count.

>The 35th calendar day has arrived, the Settlement Period Limit has nearly been reached. The Market Maker REALLY doesn't want to buy that share.

>Market Maker pushes it to the very last moment by NOT purchasing on Calendar day 35. **Instead, they buy during Pre-Market on the next Trading Day.**

\*EDIT\* The flowchart above uses ""Market Maker"" in place of the actual counterparties. In reality, these FTDs are most likely being passed from counterparty to counterparty further up the chain until it lands on the Market Maker's queue after Pre-Market of T+6. Since extending to T+35 seems to be the default behavior for shorting Gamestop through ETFs like XRT, I simplified the flowchart by just inserting the Market Maker.

Let me show you an even more simple example of this flowchart on the *actual* chart. I will only bother using T+35. Why not? That's all the Market Makers seem to use.

The start dates for this period are as follows:

3/28, 4/1, 4/2 all in 2024.

We can calculate the Settlement Period Limit using T+35 and throw in Pre-Market for each date.

5/2-3(Pre-Market), 5/3-4(Pre-Market), 5/7-8(Pre-Market) all in 2024.

[Small Price Settlement Period 3\/28-4\/2 Through To 5\/2-5\/8 \(Pre-Market\)](https://preview.redd.it/ifbbv8yynj7d1.png?width=1896&format=png&auto=webp&s=633d6b9b1e88994af86fecaad804c285671ac179)

The price scale may be small, but the percentage gain is impressive over this 35 day period.

On the left we have an extended downtrend in the price over a multi day period. 35 calendar days later we have a large upward movement. **You might be thinking that the upward movement seems too large for those 3 days of FTDs, but FTDs are only half of the puzzle**. I'll explain the second half in the next section.

For most of us that have trouble with chart analysis it may be difficult to spot normal(ish) price action vs a spike in Naked Shorting that leads to FTD accumulation. For anyone that is interested in looking into the past, I would suggest looking for an extended multi-day period of price dropping. If there is a multi-day *harsh* downtrend on no news/announcements, **there is a higher chance that they are just refusing to complete a large portion of buy orders over those days.**

To wrap this section up, I will leave the entire Rule 204 of Regulation SHO here for you:

>*Rule 204 — Close-out Requirements.* Under Rule 204, participants of a registered clearing agency (as defined in section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act) must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date, or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows: the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4; if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona-fide market making activities, the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in “threshold securities” if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Threshold securities, as defined by Rule 203(c)(6), are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver.

Source: [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm)

And here is the SECs very poor attempt at an ELI5:

>Rule 204 provides an extended period of time to close out certain failures to deliver. Specifically, if a failure to deliver position results from the sale of a security that a person is deemed to own and that such person intends to deliver as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed, the firm has up to 35 calendar days following the trade date to close out the failure to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity. Such additional time is warranted and does not undermine the goal of reducing failures to deliver because these are sales of owned securities that cannot be delivered by the settlement date due solely to processing delays outside the seller’s or broker-dealer’s control. Moreover, delivery is required to be made on such sales as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed and situations where a person is deemed to own a security are limited to those specified in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO. A common example of a deemed to own security that cannot be delivered by the settlement date is a security subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933.

# Settlers of Catan - Gamma Ramp

In the previous small price example, the price increase after T+35 seemed to far outweigh the price loss from Naked Shorting. Why is that?

It was due to two major factors.

1. **Bull's Entry Point** - Gamestop's stock had experienced a major downtrend over several years. Volume was miniscule as the price had reached an extreme low of near $10 (Post-Split). This, along with several other TA indicators alerted both small and large investors that **Gamestop's stock was at a perfect entry point to buy back in.**

[Close-To-Perfect Entry Point Was The Week of 4\/20\/2024 \(lmao\)](https://preview.redd.it/dy2miajmrj7d1.png?width=1897&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6f950c9872c3ead790d9e94d0dd4bee872496d)

2. **More Investors = More Options = Gamma Ramp -** Both small and large investors began scooping up call options for absurdly low prices. More open call contracts causes the *potential* for increased options hedging.

But, depending on the strike prices chosen, the price won't drastically rise on it's own. If the price doesn't rise enough, the Options writers won't need to hedge which means a Gamma ramp isn't going to happen on it's own. **It needs a spark to ignite it.**

**That is where the real power of FTDs is on display and this why the Market Makers and Authorized Participants naked shorting Gamestop are in DEEP shit.**

Let's have a look at that first example again but this time let's double check the dates of the Settlement Period Limit.

[5\/1-5\/3 = Wednesday - Friday](https://preview.redd.it/39ly2gfntj7d1.png?width=1896&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b108d060a3aee986467619cd94c8af88af8ca65)

It is my opinion that we are looking at a mini gamma ramp triggered by a higher-than-normal amount of options contracts being pushed Into-The-Money by FTD settlement.

Market Makers are being forced to settle their FTDs leading right into the **end of week options expiration.** Thousands of options are pushed ITM due to the abnormal purchase volume from the FTD settlement. More options being pushed further ITM causes Options Writers to purchase more shares to hedge for their potential losses causing a Gamma Squeeze. **This is how a ""small"" amount of FTDs can have a massive impact on price.** And it is exactly what we saw in January of 2021.

[Ryan Cohen's 12\/17-12\/18 Purchase Settles](https://preview.redd.it/fx7nhopn2l7d1.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=06939c751f0d27f4b6ee29af63c991831aaa7298)

Ryan Cohen saw Gamestop as a possible turnaround story and pursued a stake in the Company.

His purchase Trade Dates are as follows:

12/17/2020 - Purchased 470,311 (Split Adjusted = 1,881,244)  
12/18/2020 - Purchased 500,000 (Split Adjusted = 2,000,000)  
12/18/2020 - Purchased 256,089 (Split Adjusted = 1,024,356)

Totals: 1,226,400 (Split Adjusted = 4,905,600)

Source: [https://fintel.io/n/cohen-ryan](https://fintel.io/n/cohen-ryan)

T+35 Calendar days from 12/17 and 12/18 would place his FTD settlement period limit at 1/21-23(Pre-Market)

Above you can see the sudden upward movement of the stock followed by an explosive price change. on January 23rd, 2020 in Pre-market.

Here are the values:

1/21/2021 - Opened at $9.81 Closed at $10.76 | Percentage Gain From Previous Close: 10.02%  
1/22/2021- Opened at $10.65 | Closed at $16.25 | Percentage Gain From Previous Close: **51.03%**  
1/23/2021 - Settlement Period Limit reached at 9:29am EST. Price opened at $24.18 | Percentage Gain From Previous Close: **48.8%**

*Edit* Fixed the years above to 2021 to correctly reflect sneeze date.

**Market Maker's ABUSE of Failure-To-Delivers via Naked Short Selling caused Ryan Cohen's purchase to be delayed until January 21-23(Pre-Market).** As thousands upon thousands of options contracts were pushed Into-The-Money, Options Writers **continued buying more and more shares to hedge their losses.** This created an extremely volatile trading day as millions upon millions of shares were quickly traded due to countless options contracts being **closed and re-opened.**

Okay but what about The Cycle™?

Ryan Cohen's purchase in to Gamestop may have inadvertently kicked off this whole saga, **but why did the stock have a pattern of jumps throughout these last 3+ years before April?**

Well, I can give you an example that will hopefully help us to understand this ""Cycle"" pattern.

[January 19th and 20th - February 23rd, 24th, and 25th \(Pre-Market\)](https://preview.redd.it/dhnspkx65k7d1.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fe7181e68d54bcb87fa6c422a26ff1fef302e69)

January 19th, 2021 was a Monday following a drastic price jump that Gamestop had not seen for a VERY long time. The week of January 11th, the stock opened at $4.85(Post-Split) it closed the week at $8.88(Post-Split). **That is an 83% gain from open on Monday to close on Friday.**

It would be speculation to say that there may have been emergency calls/meetings held for these Market Makers and Authorized Participants; however, **I can confidently guess that the decision was made to open the following week HARD on Naked Shorting.** Monday and Tuesday (1/19 and 1/20), the price hardly moved as this shorting occurred. Hardly any shares were purchased by the Market maker to cover any non-options related orders. **Bear in mind volume was over 100 million shares each day that week (Post-Split).**

Once the FTDs from Ryan Cohen's purchase came due, millions of shares had to be purchased sending the stock price higher and higher. Options Writers quickly began purchasing more and more shares to hedge their losses. The resulting Gamma Squeeze sent the stock **parabolic**.

As soon as the momentum from the Gamma Squeeze was exhausted, mass options sell offs occurred beginning a general down trend; however, Market Makers were not happy with a ""general downtrend."" They needed Gamestop dropped and fast.

[January 29th and February 1st Incredible Naked Shorting](https://preview.redd.it/3untl3ez7k7d1.png?width=1635&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b13b30b81ae35353ac0693584fb3b43f89b011f)

**The buy button was removed and the fall from the Gamma Squeeze was so absurdly quick that even** ***amateur*** **investors could tell something HISTORICALLY criminal just occurred.**

Any short institution with a stake in Gamestop that COULD Naked Short this stock did so through it's entire fall after the initial Gamma Squeeze.

With fewer brokers able to purchase Gamestop due to the Clearing House restriction put in place just after the Gamma Squeeze peak, institutions at lower levels waited for their usual T+3 settlement limit hoping to buy at a lower price point. Market Makers and Authorized Participants Naked Shorted every share they could creating a massive ball of FTDs on a T+35 Calendar Day clock. **All this effort to stop the stock from resting at a MUCH higher base price and to prevent margin calls from forcing them to close long dated short positions.**

Their collusion worked temporarily as the price plummeted back to the low price of around $10 (Post Split). This most likely allowed them time to breath and re-position to survive what came next. Their extension for FTDs expired and the stock rocketed back up due to their required buy ins scheduled for late February.

**Each subsequent run up and run down is a re-run of this exact situation played at a slightly smaller scale each time.** Over time as more and more public investors (large, small, and institutional) lose interest/hope for the stock, less and less purchases are made and fewer shares need to be marked as FTD. Eventually, Market makers managed to return the stock to a very low price and have relative control over it's movement. **That is, until 2024.**

Due to my understanding of the initial Gamma Squeeze in 2021 and it's subsequent run ups:

**I believe that the key to Gamestop's release from the unlawful PRISON that is ABUSIVE naked shorting is the occurrence of multiple back-to-back gamma ramps each ignited by the Market Maker's Failure to Deliver abuse.**

# Entering The Volume - Volume Inflation

I believe this has already been covered, but I wanted to create a small section just as a *reminder* of why Gamestop has such absurd levels of volume over the course of months.

We have often seen mentions of the volume easily exceeding the available float of Gamestop's shares. **A big reason for that is due to FTDs. Every single FTD counts as a minimum of 2 volume per share.**

When an investor purchases shares through a Broker, they are added to that day's volume. The purchaser is told they have the shares in their account even though the purchase has not affected the price value. T+35 days later, the Market Maker will *actually* purchase the share, adding 1 to the volume for the day they purchased it.

This causes Gamestop's volume to inflate on a larger time scale. Looking at 3 months of volume, you will be unknowingly seeing **a portion of volume that has been doubled** due to FTD settlement.

# Dark - The Future of the Cycle

Earlier, I mentioned that Bullish investors were buying back into Gamestop in late April.

Gamestop's stock is on an uptrend and is garnering more interest from the pool of public investors. The more momentum Gamestop's stock has, the more purchasing occurs which means **more FTDs accumulating.** **If these FTDs happen to line up correctly,** they may reach their Settlement Period Limit later in the month, specifically on the 3rd Friday the **week of options and futures expirations.**

>*Triple witching hour is the last hour of the stock market trading session (3:00-4:00 P.M., New York City local Time) on the third Friday of every March,* ***June***\*, September, and December. Those days are the expiration of three kinds of securities:\*

>

>*Stock market index futures;*

>*Stock market index options;*

>*Stock options.*

>*The simultaneous expirations generally increases the trading volume of options, futures, and their underlying stocks, occasionally increasing the volatility of prices of related securities.*

Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple\_witching\_hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_witching_hour)

**The FTD purchasing along with Options and Futures contracts expiring could compound into a massive Gamma Squeeze of a similar or even larger movement than the original 2021 Sneeze.**

All that it would need is a decent amount of FTDs' Settlement Period Limits **to coincide with the same week if we were lucky, maybe the same DAY** if we were here for a *reckoning*.

But for that, we would need large investors with 100's of millions of dollars to buy into Gamestop all because they believe it is a great investment opportunity.

**Thankfully, we have possibly the most downright insane investor on Gamestop's side, DeepFuckingValue** AKA Roaring Kitty. Roaring Kitty may be crazy (aren't we all?), but he is also an *incredibly* smart trader.

\*SPECULATION AHEAD\*

I believe that DFV has taken advantage of the recent run-up/run-down to further his position and he MAY have made a large purchase 5/16/2024 while the stock was heading down from a recent large movement.

[https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/e-trade-considers-kicking-meme-stock-leader-keith-gill-off-platform-f2003ec4](https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/e-trade-considers-kicking-meme-stock-leader-keith-gill-off-platform-f2003ec4)

In the above article (pay-walled, sorry), E-Trade has potentially broken Broker-to-Trader privacy regulations and leaked that DFV had purchased options previous to his social media return.

Due to the timing of Roaring Kitty's memes this year, it is my belief that DFV DID purchase options in April and sold them at or near the peak of May 15th. He then used the profits from that sale to purchase shares on the way down on 5/16/2024.

On Roaring Kitty's stream, he showed off how accurate the bull flag was to the bottom of the original Gamestop 2021 Sneeze. I believe that **Roaring Kitty predicted the stock would eventually bottom out to around this same price and chose a price near** **the bottom as his re-entry price.**

[\\""This is all a Test\\"" - Roaring Kitty most likely referring to \\""Testing Support\\"" on the Gamestop chart](https://preview.redd.it/ea6xhihjik7d1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a19547faed16aff5af32ff62dd7621f3e3c0218)

**I speculate that Roaring Kitty entered into additional positions slightly above the support level of $10.**

Trading done in the previous 3 years as well as this new position would have his cost basis be **substantially** lowered from his original $55.17. He has purchased 4.8 million shares in the past 3 years and **we know that he averaged down HARD.**

It is possible that DFV purchased a large portion of his 5 Million shares near the bottom. If true, his purchase must have been large enough that Market Makers and Authorized Participants did **NOT** want to fulfill the order immediately. Instead, they used their T+35 Calendar Day special exemption to extend their delivery time.

At some point either slightly before or after his purchase, DFV decided that the stock has *definitely* bottomed out and he then loaded up on call options to take advantage of the eventual upward movement.

This leads us to the May run up. DFV's original stock purchase slightly above Gamestop's support line has now come due T+35 days later. The FTDs are settled for what could potentially be millions of share purchases. The purchases drive investor's options In-The-Money, sparking a Gamma Squeeze. DFV notices the price action, sells his options purchase near the peak and tries to find a good entry point as the stock is moving down after the Gamma Squeeze is exhausted.

My theory is that he **MAY** have made a purchase on May 16th 2024 as the math on his current cost basis could be averaging up after his large purchase in April.

I am using this tool to do very basic math for the cost basis:

[https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/stock-average](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/stock-average)

Just as one example: In April, if DFV had managed to purchase the majority of his large position at $16, that would allow for a new purchase on May 16th at $28 to create a VERY similar cost basis of $21.33 vs his original June 2024 cost basis of $21.27. That is a $.06 difference while only using round price points for exit and entry.

I personally believe that DFV could have purchased in April at an even lower price point. The lower you use for his April purchase, the higher he may have purchased on May 16th.

*Disclaimer: Calculating cost basis is not as simple as I am depicting. This is just a scarcely detailed example to get my point across that this is a potential timeline of events. I am also did* ***not*** *try to perfectly re-create DFV's entire purchase history, I just used recent purchases to illustrate my point.*

**But why does any of this matter?**

Because if Roaring Kitty DID purchase on May 16th, it may have been a **substantial** purchase. Far too large for Market Makers or Authorized Participants to move off exchange. They clearly have a history of just delaying the purchase, so I am willing to bet that they have Naked Shorted here again. T+35 from May 16th, 2024 is June 20th, 2024. Market Makers are allowed to further extend the deadline until Pre-Market of the next day, June 21st, 2024.

**We have potentially been gifted a massive run-up on June 21st by Market Makers and Authorized Participants' extreme abuse of FTDs via Naked Short Selling. All of this because one small cat LOVES this damn stock.**

# Exercise Machine - Exercising VS Purchasing

*This topic was included in my original post. I will be adding an edited version and including it here for important context.*

I see many people going back and forth on whether DFV purchased shares directly or exercised some of his call options on June 13th, 2024.

I am here to tell you **he almost certainly did not exercise.**

Enough time has passed for us to know with near certainty that he has not exercised.

Per the Options Clearing Corporation:

>If it's an equity or ETF weekly option, exercise notices tendered on any business day will result in delivery of the underlying shares on the second (T+2)\* business day following exercise. Index options are cash-settled on the next business day following exercise.

*Edit* I think the OCC website was updated just today to reflect CAT changes. Options exercise delivery is now T+1.

Exercising options is very different from purchasing stock directly and apes are wise to recognize that purchasing options and exercising them allows retail to **actually affect the market price directly.** It essentially bypasses the T+35 day waiting period for our purchase to hit the market. To my knowledge, they do not and cannot delay settlement past T+2 for per options regulating restrictions.

However, DFV's transaction on June 13th would have **definitely** hit the market by now.

Since we have seen next to no upward pressure since his purchase, I would assume that he instead sold his options for cash on June 12th. The updated Open Interest dropped by a massive amount after market close. Roaring Kitty then posted his Dune tweet at 2PM EST on June 13th, and in my opinion, this is him excitedly posting that he just purchased the 4,001,000 shares. Can't imagine what that feels like. After hours on June 13th, DFV then posted his updated position confirming that he holds 4,001,000 additional shares.

If you need more solid evidence that DFV did **NOT** exercise, here is Dave Lauer's tweets with another user stating that they view this as an options sale to purchase more shares. Please remember Dave has been in the industry for **years**. Yes, he can make mistakes, but he is **NOT** an amateur investor trying to spread FUD.

[Dave Lauer on DFV's new Yolo](https://preview.redd.it/micri3ifpk7d1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6c03dced340a90f938b157178d37e586fa9c848)

A large part of the discussion seems to center around Premium cost factoring into cost basis.

**Dave's years of trading experience has led him to believe that Options Premium costs are not factored into your cost basis, only the Option's Strike Price.**

So a trader reached out to DFV's Broker, E-Trade, to clarify if they factor in a premium cost to a position's cost basis in your account position portal.

[E-Trade Does NOT Factor in Premiums to Cost Basis](https://preview.redd.it/pucdpmdypk7d1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=80708afd66cb414e55aaa0e7ce2bf59d2d36159a)

**E-Trade reported that they ONLY use the Options Strike Price to adjust your Cost Basis.**

**DFV** ***almost certainly\**** **did NOT exercise his call options.**

**\*EDIT\* \***  
Several of you have reached out to me with doubts regarding E-Trade factoring in premiums for options cost basis. I agree with all of you that it seems like an odd choice to leave them out. So I wanted to include my opinion here:

In my mind, the chances of DFV exercising vs purchasing direct stock are at *least* an equal stalemate.

The math on his cost basis can be reached in either situation, so we need to look at other variables to make a decision.

If DFV exercised early, he lost out on many days of theta value. Selling his calls and then buying directly would net him *substantially* more shares than exercising too early. In the past, DFV has exercised his options by allowing them to expire ITM. It is my personal view that, if he wanted to exercise while the price action was relatively normal, he would have used this same method of allowing them to expire ITM.

Some people will say that his decision to exercise early was a part of some plan; however, T+1 has passed for the Exercised Securities Settlement Period Limit and nothing has happened. If exercising was his plan, it did not seem to work.

>**Exercise Settlement Time:**  Exercise notices tendered on any business day will result in delivery of the underlying stock on the first (T+1) business day following exercise.

Source: [https://www.theocc.com/clearance-and-settlement/clearing/equity-options-product-specifications](https://www.theocc.com/clearance-and-settlement/clearing/equity-options-product-specifications)

It is my personal opinion that DFV *does* have a plan to ride out the 2024 Gamestop action and selling his calls to buy the most shares possible seems to benefit him the most.

Coincidentally, it also can benefit us.



Since DFV is a trader that loves to interact with a community, he often **publicly posts his positions**. Now that DFV is a *whale,* a direct stock purchase that he makes on the market is almost *guaranteed* to be **millions of shares of FTDs**. With knowledge of the date of his purchase, we can make an estimate on when his purchase will *actually* affect the share price and take a position in the stock to benefit off of it. This unique set of circumstances is ONLY possible because one MASSIVE whale LOVES this stock *and* **Market Makers and Authorized Participants are ILLEGALY ABUSING THEIR RIGHTS TO NAKED SHORT.**

DFV's *near confirmed* June purchase date is June 13th, 2024.

**T+35 Calendar Days would put his direct stock purchase hitting the market on July 18th. However, Market Makers will most likely wait until the last minute by pushing it to Pre-Market of Friday, July 19th, 2024.**

I personally believe that DFV's *unconfirmed* May purchase date is May 16th, 2024,

**T+35 Calendar Days would put his direct stock purchase hitting the market on June 20th. However, Market Makers will most likely wait until the last minute by pushing it to Pre-Market of Friday, June 21st, 2024.**

# Conclusion - On the Shoulders of Giants

Thank you to anyone that stuck through and read this post!

The Gamestop saga is one **hell** of a ride and I personally cannot wait for GME to break free of it's Naked Short prison and fly free.

It is impossible for me to list everyone who has contributed DD to Superstonk but I am completely serious when I say that I am standing on the shoulders of absolute **GIANTS.** And those giants are standing on other giants ~~that are standing on other giants that also stand on giants that are all standing on Rick of Spades.~~

Seriously, 5 years ago if you told me that I would be spending time the equivalent of a full workday to write about this kind of shit in the stock market, I would have asked you to leave me alone.

Over three years of DD and chart watching must have formed a nice new wrinkle in my ape brain and that is thanks to all of you here at Superstonk.

**My understanding of this situation may need additional expanding or some small corrections; however, I believe I have at least nailed down what has caused this stock to behave so bizarrely starting from January 2021.**

**-**

With all of that said, I would like to put money in mouth:

[doxxed my account number because I am truly regarded. Edited Position Picture](https://preview.redd.it/hkk0dx1ndl7d1.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=38d3a7ea51e8a43fab386f1d0309f1bfc2e01ec8)

**This ugly fucking nightmare of a position is mine.**

I currently have 2,200 shares worth of leverage. I also have a bit more buying power left. Assuming the price stays relatively low on Thursday, I plan to purchase additional contracts for June 21st.

I want to make one thing **VERY** clear:

June 21st may or MAY NOT run up due to an FTD Settlement Period Limit+Gamma Hedging Squeeze.

I am LESS confident about June 21st than I am about July 19th.

The July 19th date is based off of two *nearly confirmed* data points: DFV publicly posted that he purchased a large amount of shares on June 13th, 2024. Even though we cannot be *absolutely* sure he purchased them *on that day* I believe due to his past posts, that **he is honest with the community**.

June 21st only has my ***best estimate*** of DFV's May purchase. **If my guess is wrong, I could lose all of the money I have poured into premiums for that ugly bastard of an options position that I call my own.**

Purchasing 1-2 Day To Expiry Options Contracts is historically a DumbFuckingMove™ and I do NOT recommend following me into **this risky as hell gamble.**

If you *are* like me and believe that the FTD Settlement Limit Periods are driving the stock movement, **it would be MUCH safer to bet on July 19th, 2024** as we have a much better idea of the exact purchase date our resident whale bought his shares on. I even have a small amount of money set aside as a backup in case my May purchase date theory is wrong and I will use that to essentially YOLO into July 19th, 2024 Expiry, or possibly the week after, July 26th, 2024.

*EDIT* Wanted to add this. PLEASE be aware how risky June 21st options are. The company completed a MASSIVE share offering in the middle of my May-June timeline. It is entirely possible that Market Makers used this offering to offset FTD settlement. It is also possible that Market Makers doubled down and added additional Naked Shorts during this offering. This is gamble I am taking.

Some have asked me how I feel about DRS. I will let this speak for itself:

[I deeply regret not YOLOing in for more shares during the $10-$12 dollar range...](https://preview.redd.it/0wo8u04xal7d1.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3d86705507f339f9ba1e77e9dc2b2a809ab8521)

I could not find a good spot to fit this into the post, but I did want to remind everyone that June 21st 2024 is the farthest dated LEAPS from January 2021. This may be an additional factor to consider as, anyone that was trying to reposition their options contracts *may* have chosen the farthest available date on the chain.

Oh and a neat trick I learned the other day...

As long as you have enough cash in your Options trading account, In-The-Money Options contracts **automatically exercise** by 5PM on the expiration date. (At least for Fidelity.)

I thought that was kind of neat.

**SMALL ASIDE REGARDING FTD DATA RELEASES**

The adjustments of my prediction for DFV's may purchase **completely invalidates** my previous theory about FTD reporting in my last post ""I Would Like To Solve the Puzzle - T+3, T+6, T+35"".

If I had to guess at why our FTD data is pretty much a crapshoot, I would reach for the utterly *classic* line of ""this data is self reported and cannot be fully relied upon."" *\*chefs kiss\**

Those missing days are most likely just days that reported 0 FTDs for that day. Whether you believe that they are reporting honestly is up to you.

Last, but not least. I thought to include my favorite song for all of you. Hopefully it will get you guys excited for Friday and remind you of all we are doing here in Superstonk.

[**Just got out of prison and owe SO much money...**](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4jyy8r/just_got_out_of_prison_and_owe_so_much_money/) - 18 May 2016  
  
I went to college and graduated but went to prison soon after about 18 months ago. I just got out on parole and am looking at the aftermath of my finances. I'm getting so many letters and calls from so many different companies I don't where to even begin...  
  
I know I had 3 credit cards, two from wells fargo and one from capital one. Apparently capital one sold off my debt a while back but wells fargo still has mine? Student loans are all over the place. I know I took out some personal loans through discover but I'm lost as who are all the companies (or just one company) that holds all my regular student debt from the university. I know at some point my loans started coming through another federal company cause of some changes in law but I'm completely lost. I just got a big ol pink letter saying my student loans are about to default.  
  
While I was in prison, some student loan company found me and sent me a letter and I was able to defer it for a year but that time has passed a few months ago. Right now I'm jobless and am crashing at a friend's house but I'm aware of how serious a student loan default is.  
  
This is all beyond what I'm mentally capable of handling right now. I just went through a stock pile of letters that were saved in the past year and am too overwhelmed to even know what to do first. What can I even do? Even if I had some crappy job (I'm engineering by education...) my first concern is a roof over my head and food. I don't even know what to tell these people when I figure out the mess of who the hell a actually owe and what. Please help me... I stayed out of trouble in prison and continued studying and try to study programming to maybe get a web dev job on the side. I want to do the right thing and get out of this endless black hole.  
  
---  
  
EDIT: I spent the last hour reading through every comment here and I think getting a free credit report to see who I owe since I haven't really had an address or phone would be a good first step. I should have said my debt is mainly student loans (80k public, 20k private...best guess...) and my credit card debt is about $6-7k so I'm really iffy about declaring bankruptcy but I will at least talk to a lawyer and learn more about the best route to take.  
  
Lastly, I got a lot of positive PMs and comments and even that small boost from a message from an internet stranger gives me hope when I let something like this bring me down. I hope one day I can post an update saying I got a great job, beat the statistics, and give hope to other felons who are trying to do the right thing. It was definitely a life changing experience and has changed my views about the prison system in general. Thank you very much.

[**[Update] Just got out of prison and owe SO much money...**](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/62uk9h/update_just_got_out_of_prison_and_owe_so_much/) - 01 Apr 2017  
  
It's been a year since I got out of prison and thought about updating for a few months but wanted everything to be absolutely settled before I did. I ended up moving to a more tech friendly city and the job search was still rough. I actually got a job offer 2 weeks after moving and was so excited to start. They asked about my background and I was totally honest with them. After some discussion, they still wanted to hire me but then a few days later I got a call saying HR wouldnt allow it. I was pretty beat up. Over the next few months I got a few interviews and even job offers but any time the background check came up I was denied. The only thing worse than not having a job is knowing you have the skills to get hired but something like this holds you back. Im not going to lie and say it was easy. I broke down some nights but picked myself back up the next day and put out my application again. I worked at a restaurant to make some kind of money and it was rough. I was coming home with $10 sometimes and wondered if this was really going to be my life.  
  
I continued to get calls from debt collectors but ignored them everytime. In the end of September I was having a particularly rough week making no money a work (serving tables) and had a job interview lined up. I didnt really have much hope for this job but figured screw it. Later that day they told me I had the job but at that point it didnt even bring me excitement as I've heard that line before. I did the usual background check and waited for the fatal call. A call came that Friday and was told I was to start on Wednesday of next week. I was confused and in disbelief. Everyday for a few weeks I expected someone to call me or pull me to the side work and tell me there's been a mistake. For the first three months I never even brung anything to put on my desk cause I figured it was any moment now. I worked there making more in one week sitting at a desk doing what I love to do than I was busting my butt for an entire month at a restaurant.  
  
Finally, one day in Janauary I was pulled to the side. The hiring manager asked me to see him in his office and he had a pretty serious look on his face. He sat me down and told me I've been doing very well these past couple of months. My supervisors are impressed with how fast I've caught on and they decided to give me promotion. I was blown away. So here I was, 4 months into a job and I was offered a promotion with a great raise.  
  
I still work hard everyday there. I study up and learn more and try to improve myself with programming everyday. I look back at those few months where I was job searching and know that I made it as far as I did because even on days I was so depressed I didnt even want to get out of bed, I still got up and tried. What else could I do? I still worry about the future but for now, I want to work here for a while getting as much experience and time behind me so my criminal history will pale in comparison to my skills and drive to succeed. Ive even managed to get a pretty good girlfriend who know all about my past and we've been dating for five months. She's supportive and is proud of how far I've gotten and how much I still do to make sure my past does not define me. I've helped a number of people start on their programming career and have even given presentations for new comers. Have I gotten some back lash? Yes, but screw those people.  
  
As for my loans, I've saved up an emergency fund for 6 months and as of 2 weeks ago, I paid the last bit I owe on my credit card. I still have a mountain of student debt but I pay it off bit by bit. I dont get anymore calls about money I owe and well, life is alright. I hope anyone who is in a similar situation as me can look at this and know, someone in the same boat as you has made it through and succeeded.  
  
TLDR; hard work and perseverance pays off.

This is all beyond what I'm mentally capable of handling right now. I just went through a stock pile of letters that were saved in the past year and am too overwhelmed to even know what to do first. What can I even do? Even if I had some crappy job (I'm engineering by education...) my first concern is a roof over my head and food. I don't even know what to tell these people when I figure out the mess of who the hell a actually owe and what. Please help me... I stayed out of trouble in prison and continued studying and try to study programming to maybe get a web dev job on the side. I want to do the right thing and get out of this endless black hole.  
  
---  
  
EDIT: I spent the last hour reading through every comment here and I think getting a free credit report to see who I owe since I haven't really had an address or phone would be a good first step. I should have said my debt is mainly student loans (80k public, 20k private...best guess...) and my credit card debt is about $6-7k so I'm really iffy about declaring bankruptcy but I will at least talk to a lawyer and learn more about the best route to take.  
  
Lastly, I got a lot of positive PMs and comments and even that small boost from a message from an internet stranger gives me hope when I let something like this bring me down. I hope one day I can post an update saying I got a great job, beat the statistics, and give hope to other felons who are trying to do the right thing. It was definitely a life changing experience and has changed my views about the prison system in general. Thank you very much.

Got out in 15 months for good time and parole. I'm glad you were able to start a career. This give me good hope since we have the same criminal history. Looking back I feel embarrassed for my actions so thinking of even having to even bring it up in an interview is stressful to say the least.

He had collectors calling him, threatening to sue him, and all that not so fun stuff. Getting a GOOD job was tough as shit and man, I watched him struggle. He went to school and got a bachelors, he is working on his masters, and he FOUGHT to get a job. Right now he is working on getting his sentence reduced (wobbler) and getting his record expunged.

I'm scared to meet a woman just to be looked at with disgust when I tell her I'm a felon. I do want to do right and I hope to find someone who can look past what I've done and see me who I am now. Seems like you stuck to him through a lot for a long time and as someone who is starting the struggle that he's gone through, having someone like that would make a huge difference right now.

[**[Update] Just got out of prison and owe SO much money...**](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/62uk9h/update_just_got_out_of_prison_and_owe_so_much/) - 01 Apr 2017  
  
It's been a year since I got out of prison and thought about updating for a few months but wanted everything to be absolutely settled before I did. I ended up moving to a more tech friendly city and the job search was still rough. I actually got a job offer 2 weeks after moving and was so excited to start. They asked about my background and I was totally honest with them. After some discussion, they still wanted to hire me but then a few days later I got a call saying HR wouldnt allow it. I was pretty beat up. Over the next few months I got a few interviews and even job offers but any time the background check came up I was denied. The only thing worse than not having a job is knowing you have the skills to get hired but something like this holds you back. Im not going to lie and say it was easy. I broke down some nights but picked myself back up the next day and put out my application again. I worked at a restaurant to make some kind of money and it was rough. I was coming home with $10 sometimes and wondered if this was really going to be my life.  
  
I continued to get calls from debt collectors but ignored them everytime. In the end of September I was having a particularly rough week making no money a work (serving tables) and had a job interview lined up. I didnt really have much hope for this job but figured screw it. Later that day they told me I had the job but at that point it didnt even bring me excitement as I've heard that line before. I did the usual background check and waited for the fatal call. A call came that Friday and was told I was to start on Wednesday of next week. I was confused and in disbelief. Everyday for a few weeks I expected someone to call me or pull me to the side work and tell me there's been a mistake. For the first three months I never even brung anything to put on my desk cause I figured it was any moment now. I worked there making more in one week sitting at a desk doing what I love to do than I was busting my butt for an entire month at a restaurant.  
  
Finally, one day in Janauary I was pulled to the side. The hiring manager asked me to see him in his office and he had a pretty serious look on his face. He sat me down and told me I've been doing very well these past couple of months. My supervisors are impressed with how fast I've caught on and they decided to give me promotion. I was blown away. So here I was, 4 months into a job and I was offered a promotion with a great raise.  
  
I still work hard everyday there. I study up and learn more and try to improve myself with programming everyday. I look back at those few months where I was job searching and know that I made it as far as I did because even on days I was so depressed I didnt even want to get out of bed, I still got up and tried. What else could I do? I still worry about the future but for now, I want to work here for a while getting as much experience and time behind me so my criminal history will pale in comparison to my skills and drive to succeed. Ive even managed to get a pretty good girlfriend who know all about my past and we've been dating for five months. She's supportive and is proud of how far I've gotten and how much I still do to make sure my past does not define me. I've helped a number of people start on their programming career and have even given presentations for new comers. Have I gotten some back lash? Yes, but screw those people.  
  
As for my loans, I've saved up an emergency fund for 6 months and as of 2 weeks ago, I paid the last bit I owe on my credit card. I still have a mountain of student debt but I pay it off bit by bit. I dont get anymore calls about money I owe and well, life is alright. I hope anyone who is in a similar situation as me can look at this and know, someone in the same boat as you has made it through and succeeded.  
  
TLDR; hard work and perseverance pays off.

"As an Elder Millennial, I think this election finally broke me","I'm in my 40's and I'm generally an optimist about everything. But I'm beginning to think all the political things I lived through the last 20 years broke me.

I first started getting involved in politics during the Clinton era and watched Newt Gingrich introduce tribalism and lack of decorum in politics. I watched him and Republicans bring in Ken Starr as an exploratory tool just for political gain just to weasel their way into demonizing Clinton in any way they can.

I voted in my first election for Gore and watched Republicans steal the election from him. But I took it in stride and still had faith in our democracy only to watch Bush lead us into Iraq under completely made up lies.

I had a glimmer of hope when Obama was elected and watched the country begin to go mask off with racism toward him.  I watched him try to enact policies for the good of the entire country only to have Republicans band together around obstructionism to prevent him from getting anything done. I then watched him kowtow to big money by bailing out big banks with no consequences and compromise a Universal Healthcare plan to the industrial money making medical machine that is our current healthcare system.

I watched Mitch McConnell rise to power and hold the Supreme Court hostage. Only to then have the Supreme Court destroy our democracy by opening the flood gates to money in politics in Citizens United.

I watched Fox News grow more and more conspiratorial during this time with hosts like Glenn Beck turning news into a mockery of lies and conspiracy theories. Then when he left the station, I watched as they turned up the dials on the hatred filled conspiratorial money making machine even further with Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. I watched as the rest of the news followed the money and become a laughingstock as well.

I watched the next election go completely sideways for Clinton as people elected a conman reality show host  that spent his entire campaign and term in office amping up hate and all the worst things about Politics.

I watched as we proved a candidate aligned themselves with a foreign adversary as a means to help him win the election, saw people on his campaign team go to prison for it, only for their to be zero consequences and have it shoved in our face as a ""negative"" somehow.

I watched that same President continue to destroy all decorum of the Presidency and sow distrust in absolutely everything and continue to ramp up anger in the country in anyway possible. I watched him continue to vilify any concept of journalism, while simultaneously working with the likes of Hannity and Carlson behind the scenes in secret talks with zero repercussions.

I watched him systematically destroy the rights of women, destroy the rights of LGBTQ+ community, imprison migrant families, subjugate protesters, and somehow rally his base around the farcical concept that in some imaginary world ""hE's PrOtEcTiNg MUH-FREEDOMS!""

I watched as he let a Global Pandemic ravage the country because it would be bad for his re-election campaign. I watched more far right extremist news outlets pop up out of nowhere and help him convince the American public that 1 million people didn't die COVID and that masks and doctors are the enemy.

I watched in complete horror and disbelief as a violent mob literally attacked our nation's capital when they didn't like the election results. I was convinced this was the end to a very very dark era in our country, only to see every Republican convince themselves this somehow simultaneously not a big deal (just some tourists), a Democratic psy-op (it wasn't us, it was ANTIFA), and also that it was a good thing and nobody died (even though people died).

I listened to a literal audio recording of him trying to subvert democracy with, once again, absolutely zero consequences.

I watched the country get photographic proof that he stole our top secret documents and kept them in his golf club's bathrooms for his own personal gain. And guess what? SPOILER ALERT: he saw absolutely Z.E.R.O. FUCKING consequences. What a big surprise! Amirite?

I watched with disgust as he made money directly from his Presidency and made money for his family members with foreign powers. I watched nepotism in full blown action as the American public cheered him on for it.

I watched him in repulsion as he shattered any dignity associated with the role of the President of OUR United States by reducing it into a cheap late night infomercial salesman as he peddled the most asinine bullshit with his name on it.

I watched as countless people that worked with him, literally tell our entire country that he is a fascist, a threat to democracy, and an existential threat. THEY TRIED FUCKING WARNING YOU and somehow that got turned around on us as if we shouldn't be saying these things because saying stuff like that is somehow out of line?????

And now, a few days ago on Nov 5th, about a quarter century after I first began to take an interest in politics, I just watched the American people vote loud and proud that this degenerate of a human being is who they want to lead this country again after watching all the same things I did about him.

Every step of the way, I remained positive and just tried so hard to make this a country that is slightly better for everyone. A country that is slightly more educated and knowledgeable. That is slightly more compassionate. That is slightly more understanding. I expected everyone to play by the rules and treat other with the respect, dignity, and professionalism they deserve. 

But this is where we ended up.

I think I'm done. I can't do this anymore. Fuck the system.

Feel free to change my view, but I think I'm an anarchist now. Let the people get exactly what they want. 

Let him ruin the economy. Let him take away healthcare and social security. Let him deport whoever he wants. Let him tear up the constitution. Let him destroy democracy. Let him be king. Burn it all down.

I didn't even leave him a fork,"Not a throwaway account because idgaf if he sees this.

My brother is 53 and has lived off of our parents his whole life.  He's never bought his own car or paid his own rent.  He's never even paid his own child support. Our mom died a couple of years ago and his behavior really spiraled. He had always been a violent drunk, and after her death he was always drunk. He also became more and more abusive to our dad. When he was finally arrested, I was able to step in and take care of dad for the last 5 months of his life.  I had tried before, but the fog of abuse was too dense and my dad couldn't admit his son had betrayed him like that. 

Over the months, my dad shook free of that fog and wanted me to throw everything of my brother's away.  He wanted him to get nothing from him ever again.  I didn't toss his stuff, I just put it in a storage building. Dad changed his will to leave the land to my nephew, brother's 10 year old son and everything else divided between bro and me. I thought.  After he died,  I found out that the land was deeded to nephew and EVERYTHING else went to me.  All of the physical possessions that were not the land or mobile home.

20 min after my brother found out about dad's death,  he showed up to throw me out of the trailer. He also tried to get into the bank and change the funeral so he could get the death certificate.  The lawyer told me I did have to get out, but I was ok to take everything and move it into storage if I chose to.  So,  I did.  

Our cousins  were happy to help.  My kids and husband also joined in and in 4 days we were able to get 99.99% of the stuff moved out.  Dad didn't want bro to have anything and I left him nothing.  Not even a fork. I turned off the power, the water,  the trash and the internet.  His car will be repossessed if he can't get it refinanced and he'll lose the trailer if he doesn't get a mortgage to cover what's owed. He works 2-3 days a week making pizza,  so the banks may be reluctant.

Power banks exceeding 160Wh  now banned on flights,"MANILA, Philippines — All power banks exceeding 160 watt-hours are strictly prohibited on both international and domestic flights, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) announced on Tuesday.

CAAP spokesman Eric Apolonio said the agency’s flight operations officials are coordinating with local and foreign airlines at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport and other major airports nationwide to regulate the use of power banks.

These devices, classified as portable lithium-ion battery packs, are being scrutinized following an incident last Feb. 28 in which an Air Busan aircraft caught fire at Gimhae International Airport, reportedly due to an overheating power bank inside a carry-on bag.

James Conner, head of CAAP’s flight operations department, addressed concerns in a radio interview on Tuesday morning regarding recent aviation incidents in which power banks were suspected of causing onboard fires.

Conner clarified that power banks with a capacity of up to 100Wh may be brought onboard without prior approval.

However, those between 100Wh and 160Wh require airline approval, while power banks exceeding 160Wh are strictly prohibited on aircraft.

CAAP strongly urges travelers to check the capacity of their power banks and comply with airline policies to avoid inconvenience during their flights.

The agency is also working closely with airlines to develop awareness policies and guidelines aimed at educating passengers on the proper handling of hazardous materials during air travel.

This initiative seeks to enhance information dissemination and ensure travelers are well-informed about regulations concerning power banks and other potentially dangerous items.",78,https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2025/03/06/2426224/power-banks-exceeding-160wh-now-banned-flights?fbclid=IwY2xjawI1-edleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHbB1TAl7JPo7JuocwgRr9-jKef3CThFyyFkQRuEYU8Zk20P4G1s51mLHmg_aem_Ra3-BF4Ec-xVZUionzxePg,1741232987.0,phtravel,"Power banks exceeding 160Wh  now banned on flights MANILA, Philippines — All power banks exceeding 160 watt-hours are strictly prohibited on both international and domestic flights, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) announced on Tuesday.

I built a battery bank to help charge the Jackery that powers my CPAP for just under $400,"The second pic is the parts list and running total thus far. The inverter has a modified sine wave, which can damage more sensitive electronics like CPAPs and laptops. While driving, the DC-DC charger will charge the auxiliary deep cycle battery; when parked, the inverter is turned on with my (much friendlier pure sine wave) Jackery plugged into it, with the latter charging my phone and powering my CPAP.

I have been using this setup for 4-5 nights now, and I wake up to the Jackery fully charged, which eliminates having to anchor down at one spot for up to 6+ hours at times. Even with daily use, i.e charging my phone/Switch/etc., my Jackery has not dipped below 50% before the end of the day, which is conventional wisdom for any deep cycle battery.

Grand total: $399.17.

I hope this post helps others who need their CPAP to work as long as they need it to and/or otherwise give someone hope that this is possible, even for compacts (I drive a Camry, and removed my passenger seat for more living space 😅)",77,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jd0mkv,1742172817.0,urbancarliving,"I built a battery bank to help charge the Jackery that powers my CPAP for just under $400 The second pic is the parts list and running total thus far.

Who is your forbidden space romance?,"As a veteran Skyrim& Fallout player, I was very surprised by how lackluster Starfield is at the romance part. I really hoped we would have more than 4 annoying options in the future patches but I doubt it would happen

My top 3 picks are: 

1 - Rayna Marquez. My first thought when I saw her was ""Wow, she is pretty"". I really wish we could have done more work for her on the Den


2 - Diana Blackenbridge - the rookie captain of the ECS Constant with a cute british accent. She had potential to be a very well written character with a way better quest then the one we currently have. I wish we could have actually helped them find a place and build their own comunity wich we could visit anytime, trade and other stuff.


3 - Lt. Jilian Toft  - Also a character with a great backstory who finally could make peace with the demons from her past if you choose to side with SysDef. Would've been cool to have a personal quest where she takes a break from SysDef and joins you as a companion to track down Naeva.


Personally I think there are a lot of characters wich have great potential story-wise and romance-wise but Bethesda is simply lazy or focused on the wrong things(like 1000 planets I will most likely never travel to)",1863,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g16lhb,1728642377.0,Starfield,"Who is your forbidden space romance?

Anyone use these small power banks with integrated plug/cable?,"This is on the bigger end (for 10 mAh). They range in size from about the size of a smaller phone (like iPhone mini or SE) to more of a thick credit card form factor (for 5000 mAh). 

Could potentially replace carrying a charging plug, two cables, and a small battery. Right now my pack out only uses low power charging so I don’t need a PD brick at all. So this could replace a small dual USB-A brick, my iPhone and USB cables, and the 3000 mah battery I keep in my tech pouch. 

But then this obviously wouldn’t be great for things like plugging in a tablet and using it while plugged in, and if the wall plug point is in an inconvenient place, the little USB-C pop out might also not be convenient. 

They’re on the order of $30-40 USD at least on AMZN. Probably the smaller 5000 mah ones are fine for me.

"In ""Batman - The Dark Knight (2008)"", when Joker asks the mob bosses for ""half"" in order to kill Batman, they all laugh at him except for the Chechen (who asked the question). I have an idea why...","My post got deleted from MovieDetails - the mod said it was ""just a theory"", So here we are.  I hope it is appropriate for the sub, as I believe it makes a subtle tie-in to events in the real world at the time this film was being made:

In [this scene from TDK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUo0-nHBqZA&t=113s) the Chechen mob boss asks Joker how much he wants to kiil Batman, and Joker answers ""Half"".  Everyone laughs at the audacity, except the Chechen, who just stares at the Joker, motionless.  Why?

Hold that thought...

Back in the real world, TDK was filmed in the late-2000's.  Vladimir Putin took over control of Russia in 2000, ostensibly using many rich and powerful ""oligarchs"" to help support his bid for presidency, in exchange for allowing them to continue plundering the Russian economy.

But in 2003, Putin arrested [Mikhail Khodorkovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Khodorkovsky), the wealthiest man in Russia, and had him imprisoned while the state seized/forfeited most of his assets.  

This was widely seen as setting an ""example"" to the rest of the Russian elite, to show them what would happen to them if they didn't play ball with Putin, and allegedly, in the years following, Putin demanded a portion of the remaining Russian elite's wealth if they wanted to avoid a similar fate.

How much did he demand?  Half.

So back to the movie - Joker knocks off a mob bank early in the film (i.e. Khodorkovsky) and when he demands half of what's left from the other mobsters (after singling out their overseas banker on the video call), the only person who doesn't laugh is from Chechnya - a Russian republic in the real world.

The Chechnyan mob boss has heard this before, and realizes that Joker's long-game is to take over the whole city.  That's why he's not laughing...

Edit to add: To take this even a step further, we can consider the context at [this later point in the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bsa30TLKac&t=88s).

From 1999-2009, the [Second Chechnyan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chechen_War) was Chechnya's attempt to break free of Moscow's hold on the region.  Ultimately, though, Putin transferred a lot of local military and administrative authority to pro-Russian Chechnyans, and eventually the separatist movement fell apart.

So when Joker tells the mob boss ""Your men work for me now"", and that he'll ""cut you up and feed you to your pooches - then we'll see how loyal a hungry dog **really** is!"", I think he's referring to the pro-Russian soldiers in the real world taking over from their local Chechnyan bosses.

*Dear Mrs. [Redacted]*

*I am writing this letter to inform you that your husband [redacted] has been having an affair with a neighbor of yours in [redacted] by the name of [redacted]. They have been sleeping together and having an affair for over two years. They meet at the pool area and the dog park in your community. They often go away on weekends together camping or to various hotel rooms. I felt like you should know what is going on and why [redacted] is gone so much. I have also een him drop off your dogs at her house. No woman should have to find out about an affair this way. I am sorry. I just thought you should know.*


**Post:**

Throwaway obviously…. 

I’ve been married almost 35 years, yes to the same person, And while it hasn’t been perfect, it’s been alright, kids, dog, white fence…. I’ve got those…. Our personal lives have suffered somewhat, I went from being a virgin on my wedding night, to stepping out of my comfort zones to please him sexually ( ménage a trios) to where Saturday, it will be 6 years since we’ve been intimate at all. 

For the longest time, I thought he was having an emotional affair with his male friend, that he had fished with, but had become ill, with cancer, because he would drop everything and anything for him, including plans we had, for him, plus there were a few texts, that while not sexual, were more then friendship! 

But for some reason, while I was hurt, I was not threatened, I know he is extremely ill, there is no physical relationship going on, his time is short, and once this was out of his system, he would be back to his ‘normal’ self and me his wife…(I’m really sorry if my words sound crude, that’s not how I want them to sound) but once he passed, my husband would be back to me. 

So I was gone this past week, dog sitting/house sitting for my sister, and got home last night to check the mail….. there was a blank envelope with everything typed, inside was a short note : picture above…. I know who the female is, it’s one of his ‘friends’ I’m completely devastated!!! To me a woman is harder to compete with, what does she have/do that I don’t? 

I decided to get healthy, and lost weight, I’ve lost over 130 lbs, I don’t hear nothing from him….. I went to the Dr last week, dressed nicely, and he told me I was embarrassing him that his wife was running around town looking like a whore. With her tits hanging out …. I had a slight my off the shoulders white ilet with dark jeans….? 

Since finding this out, I’ve become obsessed, in finding evidence, I stalk her facebook, their call logs, he calls her an average 68 times a day with calls lasting 5-15 minutes, I’ll drive by her house, I’ll type and delete her name, phone number, address.. wanting to confront both of them, blame her, blame him, . Wonder what she has I don’t, how I can fix this, Do I want to fix it, do he? What do I do? Where do I go? How? I’ve cried for 2 days now, I can’t stand to look at him, and I’m afraid to talk to him,

**Additional Information from OOP**

Between Blood Pressure, Diabetes, Depression, medication it messes with your body, I spoke with my dr got mine changed up , got the drive back, He didn’t, there wasn’t much that could change in terms of his meds, but it’s obvious I don’t do it for him

So after a few days of crying and feeling miserable, I became obsessed in finding more information, mind you, this all came to light last Sunday, before that I was walking around in an ignorance state of not knowing. 

So I started scanning phone logs, daily phone calls to and from her 6 to 7+ times a day 20-40 minutes each (I had a typo in my first post) I went through his office, nightstand, etc….. I don’t know exactly what I was looking for, but I was looking for something…..I would drive by her house when he would leave, ….. in other words…. I was going crazy And by Wednesday, I broke, I was tired of him acting like it’s a normal day, that there was nothing going on…. I could not take it anymore….. and I first wanted to talk to her!!!! 

So I took off in my car, drove to the dog park, empty… so I drove to her house, started pounding on her security door, and ringing her door bell (she has a Ring) telling her to ‘open her F’ing door’ and if ‘ your woman enough to FK a married man you should be women enough to talk to his wife!’ This went on maybe 10 minutes or so, she didn’t answer, I text my husband that we needed to talk and that ‘I Know!’ 

My sister is on the phone with my trying to calm me down and to get me to leave her place, before the police are called. In the 3 minutes (yes , he picks someone in our community) it took me to get home, not only had she called him she also sent him the video!! So I confronted him, somewhat, it was more like, he gaslit me the entire time, he talked down, Get your Ass in the house, I can’t believe you did something so F’ing stupid, etc….. turned it around on me: you are always sitting on the couch, unless your sister invites you out, And didn’t deny he was with her, it’s none of your business!!!! When I asked if he would stop seeing her he said he would not give her up, she is a good friend of his

And the biggest smack in my face, he wants me to apologize to her!! For embarrassing her in her neighborhood!! And I guess she is talking about filing a restraining order against me.

So Thursday, and Friday I finished, my pity party, and Saturday, I started doing things I never thought I would have to do on my 35 anniversary…. I reached out to divorce attorneys , they were closed, but filled out the forms for consultations. I also started a resume, and applying for jobs, but after not working for 20+ years, what kinda work am I going to be qualified for???

I stayed at my sisters this weekend, I needed the change of scenery, between his attitude, the not happening anniversary, and the funky feeling I needed a break

So it’s been about a month since I found out about his affair, It still sucks!! And I’d like to say I’ve totally gotten over him, but one doesn’t turn off feelings like a light switch, at least I don’t, And sometimes, I think, maybe we can fix this, but then he does something all Ahole again, and I’m back on track with my plans and goals!

So I’ve set goals for myself, and have been working towards them, my first one, Get a job! (I was a housewife 99% of my marriage) not only did I get one, I found 2 that I can work at the same time!! I opened a secret account, not in my name, and am stashing all my extra money in it… he controls all the house money, tightly, so I have to get creative, he knows about 1 job not the other one though! 

I’ve gone back to school to get my degree, geared towards what I’m doing, so far, it’s going good, I’m remaining positive and pushing forward, even when he gets negative towards me: your just going to quit! You will flunk out, etc….. I am saving for a small place, hopefully a little ADU or an apartment, that will allow my little dogs, Once the apartment is lined up, then I will file for divorce, I need to make sure I have a safe place to go, because he will become nasty once served

So far, things are calm here, I don’t ask about her although they speak daily still, and I’m sure are hanging out, 🙄. In our community, it’s like he is trying to rub my nose in it, the thing is I’m not letting him know or see that it’s bothering me, at all.. which in turn, is bugging the crap out of him!!! So he threatened to take my phone away, ok fine, I went and bought a cheap burner phone, just in case he does…. So now, he has switched to being nice, he has bought parts for my car, paid the labor, bought my scrubs and equipment I need for work and school, he asked for a list and bought it….,

It’s times when he’s nice, I think there might be hope for us, but as long as she is in the picture, nope! Then he turns back into The Ass again with empty threats, and knocking down my confidence, and I’m back to counting months until I can move

Previous post linked above

I’m still on my phone, and just worked an overnight shift, so I’m tired.

So we are in the month of June, and quite a bit has transpired, some good some not

I finally broke down and told my kids, those were extremely difficult calls to make, and I told them everything, I took responsibility for my part, and admitted I could had done things better. They, my kids -all older- said while not perfect, I did my best with what I had, And that didn’t excuse his cheating! 

My eldest wanted to come out and go a few rounds with his dad, and confront the other woman, I told him, it wasnt worth it. 2nd son is my thinker, he didn’t say much, but he is deep in thought, you can tell, 3rd son said it’s about time , with the way he talked to you, and treated you, I hope your thinking about leaving!!!!!

I was honestly on the fence, he would flip flop between I want to work on us, and fix us to his actions said differently

And my past 2 weeks have been the worst, so since he has been using my son’s car, my son put a tracking device in his car…. Yes I have access to it, no he does not know about it. He would tell me he is going to one place and go straight to the other woman’s house, and if I would ask where he was, he would lie to my face… I just kept notes on it….. until I couldn’t anymore…

Fathers. Day - I had worked the night before, got off work at 8am, had text him what he had wanted for dinner that night, stopped at the store, bought everything, came home got it started, and tried to take a nap. (mind you, he did nothing whatsoever on Mother’s Day) 

He wakes me up to borrow $40 to go to a sporting goods store, so I said fine, dinners in an hour- hour and a half, Plz don’t be late, 2 hours later not back, I check the tracking, he went straight to her house and had not moved… so I go do a drive by, his car is parked in the garage, she is parked outside, so I come back home…. I’m more upset for my son …. I text him: you need to come home, we need to talk, I know you’re not at the sports store! Nothing. 

After 30 minutes, his car still had not moved, so I called her, of course she doesn’t answer. So I leave a voicemail: I know my husband is at your house! You win, I’m done! It’s obvious he wants to be with you, I’m tired of the lies, his bull, he doesn’t want someone who has loved and fought for him for 35 years, I’m done!!!! Come get his Dog, and his stuff you’ve won!

And I hung up

10 minutes later he comes in, with a Walmart bag says he went to Walmart then a friend, made tacos for him, I dished up servings for my son and I , then threw the rest of the meal in the trash!!! He gives me attitude, because she feels threatened now because I called her, now she has to change her number, and in her line of work, she will lose clients 😭😭. I didn’t threaten her, I told him if he wasn’t happy here he knew where the door was, he was welcome to use it!!

He was quiet all week, but was a jerk as well, and his only concern was seeing that woman.

I had melanoma removed , I needed a driver, so he took me, when I got in the car, not one word, no how are you, how did it go? Are you ok? Nope! All he said was, I’m Hungry! And it was the 30th anniversary of losing my sister to melanoma, so I was extra sensitive….

Little things were just adding up, he was forgetting things, that I needed, or I had asked, I was at the bottom of his list!

On our son’s Birthday, he couldn’t even wait for him to blow out the candles before he went to her house.

So this last Sunday. He was going through the kitchen cabinets, pulling some soup out, and said he was going to take it to this couple who have been stranded down the road for a couple weeks in a broken down RV, So I gathered a few more items, and whatnot , and he leaves, but leaves the bag of stuff on the counter….. I check, and yep, he went right to her house…. This was it.. my last bit of energy, for this marriage….

So I text him again:

I don’t understand why you need to lie, there is no: dog park, hiking trail, fishing spot, sporting goods store, broken down RV , nor Walmart on Bunkerhill! Why not be honest and tell me you’re going to her house? It’s obvious, regardless of what you’re saying, you don’t want to work on our marriage. You have and are choosing her over your family.

And sent it… and I tried to call him, Didn’t answer,,, so I text. Didn’t think you would answer

Not even 5 minutes later he comes screeching in the driveway, slamming in the house, screaming, what the F is wrong with you ? You Fing Mother Fing B! (I’m sure if I was in the same room as him, he would have hit me) I told him I’m tired of him lying to me, just tell me he’s going to the whores house, he’s been going this entire time, and yet still lies about it, And doesn’t he think if I’m questioning where he is, I know ?!?!

He called me a few choice names and ignored me the rest of the night, I’m sure my neighbors loved it!!!

I went yesterday, Monday, to file for Divorce!!!!! And got 💩 news!! Because he is a 1099 employee, hasn’t technically worked in almost 2years, although my bills are paid, because I’m not on his bank accounts, I never have been, I’ve always had to ask for money from him,, And because he stopped me from doing his taxes 3 years ago, because they were too complicated for you! If I were to file for divorce right now, and ask for alimony, he could, immediately file to lower it, and the judge could agree with him… my lawyer suggested waiting 3 months, to file, as he is now working again, started this week, and submits paper bids, so I’m to collect as much evidence as I can in the meantime… he was impressed with as much as I did have this far.

So, I’m planning and playing it cool till September

**Embarrassed_Sky3188:** I know this hurts now, but you will be better off without a parasite sucking the life out of you.

I don't know anything about this, but I think you should get a second opinion from a different lawyer. 1099s are still proof of income. It feels like they could subpoena those and his full tax records (which he may not have filed at all).

> **OOP:** He owns his own business, and the company he sub contracts through sends him a 1099, I haven’t seen a tax return in 3 years as we file separately, I try to look when he isn’t home, but his office is a mess! I’m going to keep looking though, because there has to be something,

**OOP on why she needs his alimony. Her children are all grown and she works now**

> **OOP:** I just started back to work 2 months ago, I spent most of our marriage as a housewife, taking care of him and our kids, My youngest son is 20, but is special needs, and mentally is about 12.

**OOP explains why she is waiting until September to make a move onto the alimony**

**Picture transcript of the letter:** 

*Dear Mrs. [Redacted]*

*I am writing this letter to inform you that your husband [redacted] has been having an affair with a neighbor of yours in [redacted] by the name of [redacted]. They have been sleeping together and having an affair for over two years. They meet at the pool area and the dog park in your community. They often go away on weekends together camping or to various hotel rooms. I felt like you should know what is going on and why [redacted] is gone so much. I have also een him drop off your dogs at her house. No woman should have to find out about an affair this way. I am sorry. I just thought you should know.*


**Post:**

Throwaway obviously…. 

I’ve been married almost 35 years, yes to the same person, And while it hasn’t been perfect, it’s been alright, kids, dog, white fence…. I’ve got those…. Our personal lives have suffered somewhat, I went from being a virgin on my wedding night, to stepping out of my comfort zones to please him sexually ( ménage a trios) to where Saturday, it will be 6 years since we’ve been intimate at all. 

For the longest time, I thought he was having an emotional affair with his male friend, that he had fished with, but had become ill, with cancer, because he would drop everything and anything for him, including plans we had, for him, plus there were a few texts, that while not sexual, were more then friendship! 

But for some reason, while I was hurt, I was not threatened, I know he is extremely ill, there is no physical relationship going on, his time is short, and once this was out of his system, he would be back to his ‘normal’ self and me his wife…(I’m really sorry if my words sound crude, that’s not how I want them to sound) but once he passed, my husband would be back to me. 

So I was gone this past week, dog sitting/house sitting for my sister, and got home last night to check the mail….. there was a blank envelope with everything typed, inside was a short note : picture above…. I know who the female is, it’s one of his ‘friends’ I’m completely devastated!!! To me a woman is harder to compete with, what does she have/do that I don’t? 

I decided to get healthy, and lost weight, I’ve lost over 130 lbs, I don’t hear nothing from him….. I went to the Dr last week, dressed nicely, and he told me I was embarrassing him that his wife was running around town looking like a whore. With her tits hanging out …. I had a slight my off the shoulders white ilet with dark jeans….? 

Since finding this out, I’ve become obsessed, in finding evidence, I stalk her facebook, their call logs, he calls her an average 68 times a day with calls lasting 5-15 minutes, I’ll drive by her house, I’ll type and delete her name, phone number, address.. wanting to confront both of them, blame her, blame him, . Wonder what she has I don’t, how I can fix this, Do I want to fix it, do he? What do I do? Where do I go? How? I’ve cried for 2 days now, I can’t stand to look at him, and I’m afraid to talk to him,

So after a few days of crying and feeling miserable, I became obsessed in finding more information, mind you, this all came to light last Sunday, before that I was walking around in an ignorance state of not knowing. 

So I started scanning phone logs, daily phone calls to and from her 6 to 7+ times a day 20-40 minutes each (I had a typo in my first post) I went through his office, nightstand, etc….. I don’t know exactly what I was looking for, but I was looking for something…..I would drive by her house when he would leave, ….. in other words…. I was going crazy And by Wednesday, I broke, I was tired of him acting like it’s a normal day, that there was nothing going on…. I could not take it anymore….. and I first wanted to talk to her!!!! 

So I took off in my car, drove to the dog park, empty… so I drove to her house, started pounding on her security door, and ringing her door bell (she has a Ring) telling her to ‘open her F’ing door’ and if ‘ your woman enough to FK a married man you should be women enough to talk to his wife!’ This went on maybe 10 minutes or so, she didn’t answer, I text my husband that we needed to talk and that ‘I Know!’ 

My sister is on the phone with my trying to calm me down and to get me to leave her place, before the police are called. In the 3 minutes (yes , he picks someone in our community) it took me to get home, not only had she called him she also sent him the video!! So I confronted him, somewhat, it was more like, he gaslit me the entire time, he talked down, Get your Ass in the house, I can’t believe you did something so F’ing stupid, etc….. turned it around on me: you are always sitting on the couch, unless your sister invites you out, And didn’t deny he was with her, it’s none of your business!!!! When I asked if he would stop seeing her he said he would not give her up, she is a good friend of his

And the biggest smack in my face, he wants me to apologize to her!! For embarrassing her in her neighborhood!! And I guess she is talking about filing a restraining order against me.

So Thursday, and Friday I finished, my pity party, and Saturday, I started doing things I never thought I would have to do on my 35 anniversary…. I reached out to divorce attorneys , they were closed, but filled out the forms for consultations. I also started a resume, and applying for jobs, but after not working for 20+ years, what kinda work am I going to be qualified for???

I stayed at my sisters this weekend, I needed the change of scenery, between his attitude, the not happening anniversary, and the funky feeling I needed a break

[Update #2 (in comments)](https://new.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1bidj21/comment/kzn3z7c/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3): **April 14, 2024** 

So it’s been about a month since I found out about his affair, It still sucks!! And I’d like to say I’ve totally gotten over him, but one doesn’t turn off feelings like a light switch, at least I don’t, And sometimes, I think, maybe we can fix this, but then he does something all Ahole again, and I’m back on track with my plans and goals!

So I’ve set goals for myself, and have been working towards them, my first one, Get a job! (I was a housewife 99% of my marriage) not only did I get one, I found 2 that I can work at the same time!! I opened a secret account, not in my name, and am stashing all my extra money in it… he controls all the house money, tightly, so I have to get creative, he knows about 1 job not the other one though! 

I’ve gone back to school to get my degree, geared towards what I’m doing, so far, it’s going good, I’m remaining positive and pushing forward, even when he gets negative towards me: your just going to quit! You will flunk out, etc….. I am saving for a small place, hopefully a little ADU or an apartment, that will allow my little dogs, Once the apartment is lined up, then I will file for divorce, I need to make sure I have a safe place to go, because he will become nasty once served

So far, things are calm here, I don’t ask about her although they speak daily still, and I’m sure are hanging out, 🙄. In our community, it’s like he is trying to rub my nose in it, the thing is I’m not letting him know or see that it’s bothering me, at all.. which in turn, is bugging the crap out of him!!! So he threatened to take my phone away, ok fine, I went and bought a cheap burner phone, just in case he does…. So now, he has switched to being nice, he has bought parts for my car, paid the labor, bought my scrubs and equipment I need for work and school, he asked for a list and bought it….,

It’s times when he’s nice, I think there might be hope for us, but as long as she is in the picture, nope! Then he turns back into The Ass again with empty threats, and knocking down my confidence, and I’m back to counting months until I can move

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/e8knGdyRNg): **June 25, 2024**

Previous post linked above

I’m still on my phone, and just worked an overnight shift, so I’m tired.

So we are in the month of June, and quite a bit has transpired, some good some not

I finally broke down and told my kids, those were extremely difficult calls to make, and I told them everything, I took responsibility for my part, and admitted I could had done things better. They, my kids -all older- said while not perfect, I did my best with what I had, And that didn’t excuse his cheating! 

My eldest wanted to come out and go a few rounds with his dad, and confront the other woman, I told him, it wasnt worth it. 2nd son is my thinker, he didn’t say much, but he is deep in thought, you can tell, 3rd son said it’s about time , with the way he talked to you, and treated you, I hope your thinking about leaving!!!!!

I was honestly on the fence, he would flip flop between I want to work on us, and fix us to his actions said differently

And my past 2 weeks have been the worst, so since he has been using my son’s car, my son put a tracking device in his car…. Yes I have access to it, no he does not know about it. He would tell me he is going to one place and go straight to the other woman’s house, and if I would ask where he was, he would lie to my face… I just kept notes on it….. until I couldn’t anymore…

Fathers. Day - I had worked the night before, got off work at 8am, had text him what he had wanted for dinner that night, stopped at the store, bought everything, came home got it started, and tried to take a nap. (mind you, he did nothing whatsoever on Mother’s Day) 

He wakes me up to borrow $40 to go to a sporting goods store, so I said fine, dinners in an hour- hour and a half, Plz don’t be late, 2 hours later not back, I check the tracking, he went straight to her house and had not moved… so I go do a drive by, his car is parked in the garage, she is parked outside, so I come back home…. I’m more upset for my son …. I text him: you need to come home, we need to talk, I know you’re not at the sports store! Nothing. 

After 30 minutes, his car still had not moved, so I called her, of course she doesn’t answer. So I leave a voicemail: I know my husband is at your house! You win, I’m done! It’s obvious he wants to be with you, I’m tired of the lies, his bull, he doesn’t want someone who has loved and fought for him for 35 years, I’m done!!!! Come get his Dog, and his stuff you’ve won!

And I hung up

10 minutes later he comes in, with a Walmart bag says he went to Walmart then a friend, made tacos for him, I dished up servings for my son and I , then threw the rest of the meal in the trash!!! He gives me attitude, because she feels threatened now because I called her, now she has to change her number, and in her line of work, she will lose clients 😭😭. I didn’t threaten her, I told him if he wasn’t happy here he knew where the door was, he was welcome to use it!!

He was quiet all week, but was a jerk as well, and his only concern was seeing that woman.

I had melanoma removed , I needed a driver, so he took me, when I got in the car, not one word, no how are you, how did it go? Are you ok? Nope! All he said was, I’m Hungry! And it was the 30th anniversary of losing my sister to melanoma, so I was extra sensitive….

Little things were just adding up, he was forgetting things, that I needed, or I had asked, I was at the bottom of his list!

On our son’s Birthday, he couldn’t even wait for him to blow out the candles before he went to her house.

So this last Sunday. He was going through the kitchen cabinets, pulling some soup out, and said he was going to take it to this couple who have been stranded down the road for a couple weeks in a broken down RV, So I gathered a few more items, and whatnot , and he leaves, but leaves the bag of stuff on the counter….. I check, and yep, he went right to her house…. This was it.. my last bit of energy, for this marriage….

So I text him again:

I don’t understand why you need to lie, there is no: dog park, hiking trail, fishing spot, sporting goods store, broken down RV , nor Walmart on Bunkerhill! Why not be honest and tell me you’re going to her house? It’s obvious, regardless of what you’re saying, you don’t want to work on our marriage. You have and are choosing her over your family.

And sent it… and I tried to call him, Didn’t answer,,, so I text. Didn’t think you would answer

Not even 5 minutes later he comes screeching in the driveway, slamming in the house, screaming, what the F is wrong with you ? You Fing Mother Fing B! (I’m sure if I was in the same room as him, he would have hit me) I told him I’m tired of him lying to me, just tell me he’s going to the whores house, he’s been going this entire time, and yet still lies about it, And doesn’t he think if I’m questioning where he is, I know ?!?!

He called me a few choice names and ignored me the rest of the night, I’m sure my neighbors loved it!!!

I went yesterday, Monday, to file for Divorce!!!!! And got 💩 news!! Because he is a 1099 employee, hasn’t technically worked in almost 2years, although my bills are paid, because I’m not on his bank accounts, I never have been, I’ve always had to ask for money from him,, And because he stopped me from doing his taxes 3 years ago, because they were too complicated for you!

At first glance, these headlines and numbers might seem reassuring. A nice little recovery after yesterday's “hiccup” right? Eh..theres a lot happening and a lot to unpack. Im still working through it as I keep finding data.

# Yesterday vs. Today

***Data:***

* Japanese market: -12% (Aug 5), +10% (Aug 6)
* Taiwanese market: -8% (Aug 5), +3.5% (Aug 6)
* Turkish market: -7% (Aug 5), +2% (Aug 6)
* Historical- Dow Jones (Oct 2008): -18% in a week, +11% in a day

What I'm seeing:

This whiplash we're seeing is obviously not normal, we just want to know why and what it means. Yesterday markets worldwide took a nosedive as we all saw. Japan had its worst day in 40 years. Then boom today it's all green. We've seen this movie before, and the ending isn't always pretty.

in 2008 the Dow lost 18% in a week then shot up 11% in a day after governments promised bailouts. But the market kept falling for months after that.

Or how about March 2020? The Dow dropped 35%, then suddenly jumped 11.4% when stimulus was announced. That time it led to a bull run.

So which is it this time??

  


# The Yen Carry Trade Unwind:

***Data:***

* USD/JPY: -4.14% (145 to 139) since late July
* Yen gains: +11% vs USD, +9% EUR, +8% GBP
* Japanese 10-yr yield: >0.5%, highest since 2015
* BoJ (Bank of Japan) policy shift: July 28 yield curve adjustment

[https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/government-bond-yield](https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/government-bond-yield)

What i see:

We're seeing a potential unraveling of massive hidden leverage. The Yen carry trade, a $1.2 trillion behemoth has underpined global investments for nearly two decades.

And It's not just about Japan. We're seeing ripples hit U.S. tech stocks, Australian real estate, and emerging markets. That's how interconnected we are now.

there's trillions tied up in these Yen bets. As the Yen goes up -> losses pile up -> more investors bail out ->pushing the Yen even higher. It's a nasty cycle that feeds itself.

It really does start to remind you of 2008, while trying to remain unbiased. Back then the Yen jumped 23% in just three months. Could we see a repeat?

Meanwhile, the BoJ (Bank of Japan) is in a tough spot. They've gotta choose tofight inflation now or keep the Yen from going nuts.

Not only that, the unwinding process has not yet concluded. JPMorgan just came out saying we're only halfway through the unraveling. That's trillions more dollars of positions that might need unwinding. And with the fear of a US recession and more rate hikes in Japan, thing could get ugly fast. But you were already prepped for that...weren't you ape.

# WTF is up with VIX?

***Data:***

* VIX spiked to 65.73 on August 5, dropped to 28.06 in 24 hours (-27.25%)
* Highest level since March 2020 pandemic crash (82.69)
* 2024 average: 18.5
* S&P 500 1-day move: -3.8% (largest since June 2022)
* VIX futures volume: 3x average daily

My observations:

We hit levels higher than during the '08 crash yesterday. Thats serious. Thats nuts. Then the massive drop, plummeting 27% in hours. This kind of nasty swing usually signals the dead cat bounce so many are saying (me included) but the sheer magnitude is just wild.

Look, when the VIX goes crazy like this is usually a warning sign in a normal market. Its happened in every major crash. You think back to Oct. 20th 2008 and it went to hell. 2020, it all went to hell before cans were kicked. We know that dumb money (not us) is spooked and STILL unwilling to show it. How could they. Their game and gambles would crumble even faster than what they are, causing cataclysmic effects globally.

These VIX moves are starting to solidify the Dead Cat picture, however. The only reason I wont sign that picture is the consistent manipulation and loopholes that stave off the inevitable while digging a deeper grave, filled to the brim with cans that have been kicked.

TMy gut says this rapid cool down smells like intervention. Someone's trying to paint a pretty picture on a rotting canvas (quoting my Pops)

# The Trading halts:

We've always known the game was rigged. No suprise to us. Yesterday they showed their dirty hands to the whole world again in a big way.

During the freefall major platforms like RobingtheHood, TD Ameritraitors, and FUDelity conveniently had ""outages."" (same old song to us). Retail locked outb while WS kept playing. Some blamed tech issues, others admitted to halting trades. Either way, it reeks.

This time, everyone saw it. Mainstream media, social media..,.the world got the front row seat to the manipulation we've been shouting about.

Waters wet and the market's rigged.

Moving on to more juicy insights.

# Yield Curve:

***Data:***

* 10-year and 2-year Treasury spread: Now positive at 0.15%
* 3-month to 10-year spread: Still inverted at -0.22%
* 10-year yield: 4.05%
* 2-year yield: 3.90%
* Fed Funds Rate: 5.25-5.50%

[https://www.investing.com/rates-bonds/](https://www.investing.com/rates-bonds/)

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y3M](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y3M)

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm)

The yield curve is confusing me right now and I would love some added opinions. Yeah, the 10-2 spread flipped positive. But the 3 month to 10 yr is still upside down. Its not clear to me what to make of this. Its telling two different stories right now but I'm its above my head.

Historically, when the yield curve goes wonky like this it's been a pretty solid recession warning within 1-2 years. It's possible that the recent flip in the 10-2 spread is just a temporary blip and the inverted 3 month to 10 year spread is more accurate.

Normally, long term bonds have higher yields than short term ones due to greater risk. Essentially people are seeing a lot of uncertainty in the short term -> demanding a lot more return to invest in short term bonds.

What I can say is investors are flipping thier outlook in the short term. Short term yields are being trashed, showing a flight to safety as people pile into longer term bonds, but are still incredibly learing of the long term outlook. It looks better long term, but still not great.

# The Fed's:

Data:

* Fed balance sheet: Down from $9 trillion to $7.4 trillion
* U.S. budget funded by debt: 30%
* Global debt: 355% of GDP
* U.S. debt growth: $1 trillion every 100 days
* Fitch credit rating: Downgraded from AAA to AA+

Our friends at the Fed are still sticking to QT policy to ""fight"" inflation.

>

They've shrunk their balance sheet from $9 trillion to $7.4 trillion. Sounds good, but they love to look good. Pre 2008 it was under $1 trillion.

Theyre trying to undo years of money printing without crashing the whole system. 30% of the US budget is now funded by IOUs. Global debt's at 355% of GDP. And just when you thought it was bad enough, Fitch just down graded the Us credit rating from AAA to AA+ stating ""concerns about fiscal deterioration and governance issues"". No Shite...

This debt bubble's not just big...it's godzilla and it's eyeing Tokyo, which is super ironic, yet not even the full problem. Think about how drastic it has become. We are adding $1 TRILLION every 100 days to our debt. The bizzare/criminal government interventions and bailouts seen in 2008 and 2020 won't be feasible this time round given the already (literal) unfathomable levels of debt.





# The Global Domino Effect:

***Data:***

* First bank to flail in 2008: IKB Deutsche Industriebank (Germany), July 30 2007
* Early warning signs: China, Sain, Ireland housing bubbles (early 2007)
* Northern Rock bank run (UK): September 2007

This is crucial.

Financial crises dontt just appear out of thin air. They just don't. They start with tremors in unexpected places. Like in 2008, the first dominos fell in China, Spain, and Ireland...not the U.S.

The first major bank to go under wasn't Lehman. It was a German bank most people never heard of. And get this, a week before it collapsed they thought theydd hit their earnings goals. That's how fast things can unravel. How much more so today? We are much more intertwined and algorithmic trade as increased the speed at which markets move to exponential factors.

So when we see Japans market going nuts, it's not just about Japan it's not just about the U.S. In our interconnected world as I said before.

# Geopolitics:

***Data:***

* Turkeys Erdogan hinting at sending troops to Palestine
* Recent Israeli booping a Humus leader
* Reports of potential Iranian attack on Israel
* Ongoing Eastern Eruo conflict
* Turkey blocking social media apps (this is typically a pre war sign)

Im not going to get into this on here. You can connect the dots.

What happens when you mix extreme tensions in the Middle East with an ongoing Eastern European conflict, economic uncertainty, and top it off with bizare market volatility?

>

Moving on.

# Election Season:

Skipping details for obvious reasons. But election seasons do move markets so Its a point within this piece.

Just remember, tension is how they play the entire game. While we're distracted chosing sides, the real moves happen elsewhere and everyone falls for it every time.

# Sector Divergence:

***Data:***

* Energy sector YTD performance: -8.5%
* Financial sector YTD performance: -5.2%
* Technology sector YTD performance: +15.3%
* Sector correlation dropped to 0.35 from 0.65 last year

How im viewing this at the moment:  
Again, 2008 vibes all around. When sectors start moving in opposite directions it's often a precursor to big downturns.

# My Conclusion for Today:

We're not just watching normal market cycles. Today’s market movements are nothing short of chaotic. All the Fed's horses and all the government's men wont be able to put this Humpty Dumpty together again. The markets might be putting on a show of recovery today, but this based on everything im seeing, everything your seeing...its only just begining.

Power to the players forever."
"From a former salesperson, how to approach the process of buying a car.","Hello all, I have commented on multiple posts lately some general tips and tricks and thought maybe a longer form post would help people here.

To start, I sold cars for a few years pre covid. I know that doesn’t exactly make me an expert, but the tricks and tactics haven’t really changed that much over the last 40 years. Also, I know not every dealership or salesperson are the same, I’m intending this as a sort of rough guideline of advice. Unfortunately, there isn’t a one size fits all approach or answer to it. Having said that, please feel free to comment for more details or questions. 

First, I’d like to start off my explaining the ‘process’ of car buying is all about control. Dealerships want it to take forever as long as you are resisting their control. Basically, if you show up with $40k cash wanting to buy a car at sticker, they are happy to sell it to you. But, the more you look and resist, the slower they make it. That is all to facilitate the ‘yes’ and make it feel so much better once you finally cave, and that remorse takes longer to set in so you can’t back out. Dealerships control the information you get, whether it’s pricing online, in person, or on third party sites. They control access to their vehicles. It’s all to push you into a set process that the salespeople have done hundreds or thousands of times to be the most efficient and most successful at it.

So, what is the best way to buy? I’m going to start with knowing what you want. Possibly the worst thing you can do is just show up at a dealership. Do. Your. Research. You should have your selection down to maybe 2-3 models first, and they should be comparable. New or used is ok (but not ideal), but you almost certainly can’t compare a $70k truck with a $40k mid sized suv. If you want a truck, compare trucks. If you want an suv, compare those. Do that prior to making contact with a dealership, if at all possible.

Next, you want to do 2 things that sort of go hand in hand with the first. You want to narrow down your vehicle selections to specific trims and features. Go to the manufacturers website and spec out a specific vehicle, or shop the used market for the closest to exactly what you want. This will prevent you from getting ‘stuck’ with options and packages you don’t want/need, and also give you an advantage when it comes to actually looking. If you know what you want, and know what is available, it’s harder for you to be lied to or sold junk. You also want to get preapproval from whatever bank(s) you do business with, most people recommend credit unions. Regardless, you want confirmation from a bank that they will give you x% for y terms on a total price of $z. That preapproval is dealership kryptonite.

Now is when you start ‘shopping’ and at this point it could go a few ways depending on your style, so again take this as a sort of guideline not as the only way.

Assuming at this point you aren’t 100% set on an exact vehicle and may need to test drive to make sure, reach out to your closest dealerships via email with a message of something like ‘I’m beginning my shopping and would like to compare your x with the competitor’s y. I’d like to test drive each prior to looking numbers for either, so that I make up my mind of the strengths of the vehicles without letting numbers cloud things. If you are willing to have stock number _____ ready for me, I’d like to come in at ____ to test drive.’ They should absolutely set those appointments, but also know that they 99% won’t ‘let’ you go after. Show up on time, ask for the person that assisted in the email, and take your test drive. When the drive is done, leave. You don’t need an appraisal on your car, so they don’t need your keys. You don’t need to make an excuse or a promise. Take their card, thank them for their time, be as nice to them as they are to you. If they get snippy or pushy, simply tell them that you don’t appreciate that behavior. Again, it’s important to test drive all and decide on a specific model before looking at numbers, that means going HOME. Sleep on it, take notes, make lists, and rank your options. Then, take the advertised prices and make sort of value rankings. ‘I like #1 for $35k, but if #2 got down to 30k, I’d take it.’ 

Once you have done that, which may take a day or a week depending on your style, now it’s time to BUY. You have your preapproval, you have your tiered lists and exact wants and needs. You take your #1 vehicle and reach out to as many dealerships as you feel prepared to handle, via email, with something like this: ‘I’d like an out the door price on stock number ____, inclusive of all fees and applicable rebates, no trade, transfer tag, and fully broken down. I am reaching out to multiple dealerships, best price and honest practice wins, I’m ready to buy as soon as today for the right deal. Thank you.’ Keep it short, and don’t mention all your details because you want to engage them or let them filter themselves out. You will get replies like ‘we don’t give out numbers for customers to shop other dealerships’ and you just reply ‘that’s fair, but I refuse to waste hours of everyone’s time haggling to never reach an agreement. I thank you for being honest, have a nice day.’ They will be fine, they do this all day every day.

So, you take the numbers you got and compare them to make sure stock numbers are right and all fees and prices are as well. I will say to pay attention and give bonus points to anyone that does a sort of breakdown of the pricing and attempts to educate you, I used to give some pointers to customers on how to spot ‘fake’ pricing from dealerships. From there, you look at the best OTD price, compare it to any research you’ve done on what a ‘good’ price should be, and make an offer. It is VERY important that any offer you make be realistic and something you will honor. I’m not ever going to recommend the ‘offer them 1/2 and see what they reply with’ because that is how you lose all your power. If they have a vehicle listed at $33k down from $35 MSRP, and the other offers were at $34k, you probably don’t have much room. You may say something like ‘your sales price is $33k, which is not bad, but you do have $1500 in bogus fees. If you can knock the $37k OTD down to $35 even, I can be in today to sign and drive, as long as all the numbers and vehicle match.’ This is where a lot of people mess up, they never feel confident in how much to ask for, so they either just don’t ask or they ask for too much. Keep your ask relative to something. $1500 in junk fees? Ok, I’d like $2k off. That’s a lot more likely to happen than just saying ‘you have the best price but I want an extra $2k off just because.’ It’s very easy for a salesperson to refute those asks. 

It may take a day or two, or a week, but when you get that acceptance, make sure it is in writing and signed. Then you talk financing. Run credit with that single dealership but don’t tell them about your preapproval. Let them show you rates and you can say you have a preapproval that they need to beat in order to finance. If they beat it, not match, great. Otherwise, your bank writes them a check. 

*very important here! If they talk about a finance dependent rebate, you can likely get around that. Make sure your bank will allow you to finance through them after taking delivery, and make sure the dealership loan will not have a prepayment penalty. You don’t have to tell them you are going to immediately refinance, but even saying ‘I plan to pay it off quite soon, probably in less than 6-12 months.’ Don’t just go by what they say, look at the actual contract!*

Make sure your approval from the bank is still valid and up to date on the specific make/model, and make sure you have quotes on insurance. Go to the dealership, sign paperwork. It’s very important to PAY ATTENTION to that process, look at all the numbers and make sure they are all the SAME. Don’t get home to find out they snuck in warranties. You likely dont want or need any extended warranties, even gap is usually offered cheaper elsewhere.

Lastly, inspect the vehicle! Make sure it’s either daylight or well lit at night. do a full walk around, looking for scratches or dents or dings or panel gaps. Check for floor mats, check for both sets of keys, check for any warning lights. If ANYTHING is wrong, do not take delivery of that car until they put it in writing that they will fix it or they do fix it. Anything they promise needs to be on a ‘due bill’ that is basically a written promise for them to fix it. Be specific! Try to ask any questions about operations of navigations prior to leaving. They should be willing or insisting on doing a full deep dive of the systems for you. They HATE getting pestered for that sort of menu stuff and complaints later, so let them do it. 

When everything is done, take your vehicle and enjoy. Write the salesperson a good review on a review site and mention them by name, as long as they earned it. You can reach out if you have questions, but don’t expect immediate answers, don’t be pushy. ‘Hey, it’s ___. I had a question regarding the car I bought from you. It isn’t urgent and it isn’t a problem, I’m just confused how to find that one menu, could you help when you have a moment?’ They will probably send you a video link, offer for you to stop by, shoot their own video in another vehicle, or tell you the menu steps. Regardless, if you have issues have the sale, allow them the opportunity to correct them. 

I hope all that helps, and I apologize if it’s too vague. I specifically didn’t cover things like trading a car, negative equity, or first time buyers/bad credit because those could all be full posts in themselves. Again, please reach out with any questions.",1725,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/1i5u5mc/from_a_former_salesperson_how_to_approach_the/,1737390543.0,whatcarshouldIbuy,"From a former salesperson, how to approach the process of buying a car. Hello all, I have commented on multiple posts lately some general tips and tricks and thought maybe a longer form post would help people here.

To start, I sold cars for a few years pre covid. I know that doesn’t exactly make me an expert, but the tricks and tactics haven’t really changed that much over the last 40 years. Also, I know not every dealership or salesperson are the same, I’m intending this as a sort of rough guideline of advice. Unfortunately, there isn’t a one size fits all approach or answer to it. Having said that, please feel free to comment for more details or questions. 

First, I’d like to start off my explaining the ‘process’ of car buying is all about control. Dealerships want it to take forever as long as you are resisting their control. Basically, if you show up with $40k cash wanting to buy a car at sticker, they are happy to sell it to you. But, the more you look and resist, the slower they make it. That is all to facilitate the ‘yes’ and make it feel so much better once you finally cave, and that remorse takes longer to set in so you can’t back out. Dealerships control the information you get, whether it’s pricing online, in person, or on third party sites. They control access to their vehicles. It’s all to push you into a set process that the salespeople have done hundreds or thousands of times to be the most efficient and most successful at it.

So, what is the best way to buy? I’m going to start with knowing what you want. Possibly the worst thing you can do is just show up at a dealership. Do. Your. Research. You should have your selection down to maybe 2-3 models first, and they should be comparable. New or used is ok (but not ideal), but you almost certainly can’t compare a $70k truck with a $40k mid sized suv. If you want a truck, compare trucks. If you want an suv, compare those. Do that prior to making contact with a dealership, if at all possible.

Next, you want to do 2 things that sort of go hand in hand with the first. You want to narrow down your vehicle selections to specific trims and features. Go to the manufacturers website and spec out a specific vehicle, or shop the used market for the closest to exactly what you want. This will prevent you from getting ‘stuck’ with options and packages you don’t want/need, and also give you an advantage when it comes to actually looking. If you know what you want, and know what is available, it’s harder for you to be lied to or sold junk. You also want to get preapproval from whatever bank(s) you do business with, most people recommend credit unions. Regardless, you want confirmation from a bank that they will give you x% for y terms on a total price of $z. That preapproval is dealership kryptonite.

Now is when you start ‘shopping’ and at this point it could go a few ways depending on your style, so again take this as a sort of guideline not as the only way.

Assuming at this point you aren’t 100% set on an exact vehicle and may need to test drive to make sure, reach out to your closest dealerships via email with a message of something like ‘I’m beginning my shopping and would like to compare your x with the competitor’s y. I’d like to test drive each prior to looking numbers for either, so that I make up my mind of the strengths of the vehicles without letting numbers cloud things. If you are willing to have stock number _____ ready for me, I’d like to come in at ____ to test drive.’ They should absolutely set those appointments, but also know that they 99% won’t ‘let’ you go after. Show up on time, ask for the person that assisted in the email, and take your test drive. When the drive is done, leave. You don’t need an appraisal on your car, so they don’t need your keys. You don’t need to make an excuse or a promise. Take their card, thank them for their time, be as nice to them as they are to you. If they get snippy or pushy, simply tell them that you don’t appreciate that behavior. Again, it’s important to test drive all and decide on a specific model before looking at numbers, that means going HOME. Sleep on it, take notes, make lists, and rank your options. Then, take the advertised prices and make sort of value rankings. ‘I like #1 for $35k, but if #2 got down to 30k, I’d take it.’ 

Once you have done that, which may take a day or a week depending on your style, now it’s time to BUY. You have your preapproval, you have your tiered lists and exact wants and needs. You take your #1 vehicle and reach out to as many dealerships as you feel prepared to handle, via email, with something like this: ‘I’d like an out the door price on stock number ____, inclusive of all fees and applicable rebates, no trade, transfer tag, and fully broken down. I am reaching out to multiple dealerships, best price and honest practice wins, I’m ready to buy as soon as today for the right deal. Thank you.’ Keep it short, and don’t mention all your details because you want to engage them or let them filter themselves out. You will get replies like ‘we don’t give out numbers for customers to shop other dealerships’ and you just reply ‘that’s fair, but I refuse to waste hours of everyone’s time haggling to never reach an agreement. I thank you for being honest, have a nice day.’ They will be fine, they do this all day every day.

So, you take the numbers you got and compare them to make sure stock numbers are right and all fees and prices are as well. I will say to pay attention and give bonus points to anyone that does a sort of breakdown of the pricing and attempts to educate you, I used to give some pointers to customers on how to spot ‘fake’ pricing from dealerships. From there, you look at the best OTD price, compare it to any research you’ve done on what a ‘good’ price should be, and make an offer.

OnePlus magnetic power bank,"So I had ordered the one plus magnetic power bank shortly after I picked up the 100 watt power bank from them through aliexpress. While I didn't necessarily make a post about the power bank I can say that thing works like a charm and I'm glad I have it but what can I say about the magnetic mini power bank that they just revealed is coming to the US version of The One Plus store front? Well it's a little bit lackluster as I can honestly say it is very weird having a one plus accessory trickle charge my OnePlus device. 

Not that it matters but just so I can put it out there I'm using this power back with the OnePlus 13. The phone that it was advertised with as a brand new accessory coming to the OnePlus line of families and joining the lineup with the OnePlus 13. Now if there's anything I can say that's good about this power bank it would have to be its size and its looks. Let me just get this right out of the way this thing is tiny and built really well and I appreciate that as I've always been more drawn to smaller power bank accessories. That's probably what drew me to the Sharge OnepPlus Pouch even though that thing definitely ended up being a bit larger than a lot of the promotional images had us believe. It's not a bad charger it's just very clunky. 

As I'm writing this little overview the magnetic power bank has been slapped to the back of my OnePlus 13 for about 10 minutes now as of reaching this portion of this body of text and it has only managed to charge 3%. That is doing it via the coils through wireless charging. When I had originally opened up the battery pack this morning I tried the charging method using the cable and honestly the charging speed was about the same. The battery pack and the phone itself are still really cool to the touch and I'll be honest I'm not a big fan of a lot of magnetic accessories which is why I didn't go for the magnetic wireless charger. It just kind of seemed well pointless for me. 

This power bank kind of sits in between. I'm glad that I can at least have a power bank like this on the ready in case of emergencies that fits comfortably inside my wallet without making it feel bulky. But at the same time I wish it charged a little bit quicker. I'm not asking 80 or 100 Watts. But something closer to 40 or 50 watts would have at least been nice even if it meant I had to use the micro usb-c cable included in the box. 

It's unfortunate that the battery capacity for this little power bank is actually smaller than the OnePlus 13 and it's predecessor the 12. But I'm going to give it a few more runs and I'll gladly add an extra comment or answer any questions below but overall I can say it's not a terrible accessory but it does feel like it leaves a lot to be desired and it's asking price of $70 is relatively high for what you get and I think if it would have retailed at a starting price of about 40 to 50 it would have been a little bit more justifiable. But at $70 it kind of comes off as a really hard sell and I'm hoping that if they do bring the 100 watt power bank to the US site it's not going to be horribly overpriced because I would like to be able to purchase more of these accessories domestically rather than importing them and dealing with incompetent mail services from the likes of AliExpress and trading shenzen.",113,https://i.redd.it/ne38p0pujbre1.jpeg,1743119040.0,oneplus,"OnePlus magnetic power bank So I had ordered the one plus magnetic power bank shortly after I picked up the 100 watt power bank from them through aliexpress.

HDFC Credit Cards - A Complete Guide. [Please Read this before posting anything HDFC],"It's no surprise, HDFC is one of the biggest banks in India, if not the biggest. And every day, more and more people are either applying for HDFC Cards, or getting pre-approved offers as they have Salaried account, and we are getting REPEATED posts about the same topics, that makes it kind of difficult to get the right answers for newcomers. 

Here's a complete guide, so please read this before posting anything. 

### Core vs Co-brand cards

The Core cards from HDFC are-
- Freedom
- Moneyback/+
- Millenia / DinersClub Millenia
- DinersClub Privilege 
- Regalia Gold 
- DinersClub Black Metal
- Infinia Metal

The Co-brand cards from HDFC are-
- Swiggy 
- Tata Neu
- Mariott Bonvoy 
- Indian Oil
- Indigo 6E
- IRCTC

And two more cards from HDFC within PayZapp that qualify as core cards for discounts are
- Pixel Play {split limit, not recommended unless first}
- Virtual RuPay 

For self-employed or business people, these are also counted as core cards -
- Business Moneyback 
- Biz First
- Biz Grow
- Business Regalia
- BizPower
- BizBlack

There are a few older variants of cards which may or may not be discontinued for fresh applications.
- DinersClub Black (non metal, but many got LTF)
- Infinia (non metal - some users migrated already, but some are still having their old plastic infinia LTF. )
- TimesCard 

### What should be my first HDFC Card?

You should take one of the ***core cards*** from HDFC, as whatever co-brand card you take later, it will share the credit limit with your existing HDFC card.

If you take co-brand cards first, you may be able to apply for other co brand cards, and they will share the limit, but the bank would make it either super difficult for you to get a core card, or ask you to close existing co-brand cards before applying for a core card. We are recently seeing people getting freedom card from PayTM app even after holding co-brand cards, but then moving up the core card ladder may take some time and efforts.

The Pixel Play card is weird because it asks you to split your limit towards that card, and it's an irreversible reaction. (I have heard of people who got pixel play, not being able to tranfer back the limit to their OG core card even before/after closing pixel) (update- there seems to be an option to transfer a limit back, but I won't believe it till I see it)

### Is my new card lifetime free?

If you apply from the website, you probably got the 'choose your card' page, and you were either shown the card you were looking for, or given a choice between three. In the bottom, in blue color ribbon, the card fees were mentioned, so take a screenshot of that while applying. If it says ""Life Time Free"", it means it IS free, and you won't be charged Joining fees or Annual/Renewal fees. 

Alternatively, if you applied from from Swiggy or Tata Neu app, take screenshot of your LTF offer there.

Once you get the card, send a mail to customer care to confirm if the card issued to you is LTF. They will reply to you within a day mostly. 

customerservices.cards[at]hdfcbank.com

First Year Free means that you WILL have to pay the Annual/Renewal fees for the card after the first year unless you meet the spend criteria. 
You can always email them and request for LTF conversion, but results may vary. 


### Is HDFC Swiggy Worth It?

***YES*** 
Absolutely, infact, it's better than Millenia especially with the rewards redemption fee. 

I'll go ahead and say that it is worth it despite the fees if your usage aligns with it. If you get it LTF, go for it. Pounce on the offer/card 

### Why is Swiggy not LTF for me?

We don't know. You should just wait for a few months, you will get the LTF offer. Till then, you can get SBI Cashback and/or Airtel Axis and/or HSBC Live+

### Which HDFC Card am I eligible for? Which cards can be offered via FD

A short while ago, this post was shared on the sub. It has the current eligibility criteria for the HDFC Card suite

https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/s/sZGbaKxl88

Refer to this above post to see the minimum limits, salary eligibility, government salary eligibility, ITR requirement and/or FD criteria (if available)

### HDFC is not offering me Limit Increase/Enhancement 

First check from your netbanking/app, and if you don't see an offer, Email their greviance redressal team. Usually HDFC rolls out LE offers between 20th-23rd of the month. 

### HDFC Card Upgrade

Same as above. Usually to move to DCBM or Infinia Metal is a tryst of its own, so tread with preparation. 
They may ask you to mail documents to their Chennai office, so you can either do this yourself or drop off documents at your nearest branch. They will mail it for you. 

The other upgrades may be FYF Regalia Gold or FYF DCP from Millenia. These are also good, but choose according to use case. 

### One Line Review of the following cards from my side-

#### Core
- **Freedom** - Great to get your foot in the door for HDFC Core Cards ladder and get the sale discounts.
- **Moneyback** - Slightly better than freedom, still basic. Milestones easy to hit to get gift vouchers.
- **Millenia** - Good cashbacks but lower caps. Redemption fees are bad. Prefer Swiggy HDFC over this, keep this for core discounts offers. Again, good and easy to hit milestones and get gift vouchers. 
- **DinersClub Millenia** - Same as Millenia, but on Diners Network. Poor acceptability.
- **DinersClub Privilege** - Great beginner card for lounge and movie benefits. Prefer if offered LTF over Millenia. Acceptance may be an issue. SmartBuy points make sense!
- **Regalia Gold** - Best beginner card for entering points and miles game. Amazing for lounge access. SmartBuy is super useful!{Atlas is better but costs twice and from a different bank}.
-  **DinersClub Black Metal** - Almost Infinia. 9.9% on GCs, 16.6% on Flights, 33% on Hotels through SmartBuy. Unlimited Lounge and Golf! Some milestone benefits are good too. High annual fees. 
- **Infinia Metal** - Apun ich bhagwaan hai.  

#### Co Brand
- **Swiggy** - Great for those who didn't get SBI Cashback. Better than Millenia as cashback comes in statement directly. 
- **Tata Neu Plus/Infinity** - Good ones. Infinity is better. Great for UPI if taken RuPay and spends in Tata ecosystem. Unconditional lounge access. 
- **Mariott Bonvoy** - Great for Mariott Silver states, one night stay and lounge access. 
- **Indian Oil** - good for fuel spends. RBL, SBI, Axis options should also be checked. 
- **Indigo 6E** - weird as the rewards program is not yet integrated with the Blue Chip ecosystem. Still looks good to me. Check as per your use case. 
- **IRCTC** - half decent. I've heard that there are too many cashback exclusions.

#### PayZapp
- **Pixel Play** - If you cannot get SBI Cashback, Millenia or Swiggy, then only look at this. 
- **Virtual RuPay** - no. Unless you started with a co-brand card and desperately need a HDFC Core card for FK/AZ sales or instant discount offers. 

#### Business Cards
- BizFirst, BizGrow, Business Moneyback - Basic Starter cards. Good for instant discounts.
- Business Regalia - Lounge was the only good perk, and even that has a spend criteria now. Won't recommend. 
- BizPower - This is good. But the rewards accelerator kicks in at 20k spends a month. Risky if you don't have fixed expenses. If you do, you can get good rewards! Great for tax payments. 
- BizBlack - Also great card. Especially alongside infinia. The reward rate is mind-blowing. Do note that this also has same issue as above, where you need X amount of spends for the rewards to kick in. The redemption is also through NetBanking.

The Brahmastra of HDFC Cards. It has 3x, 5x and 10x multipliers for rewards/cashbacks, and you can use it to book flights and hotels, and also order high value products at higher reward rates.

",1304,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1j9bd4e/hdfc_credit_cards_a_complete_guide_please_read/,1741754887.0,CreditCardsIndia,"HDFC Credit Cards - A Complete Guide. [Please Read this before posting anything HDFC] It's no surprise, HDFC is one of the biggest banks in India, if not the biggest. And every day, more and more people are either applying for HDFC Cards, or getting pre-approved offers as they have Salaried account, and we are getting REPEATED posts about the same topics, that makes it kind of difficult to get the right answers for newcomers. 

Here's a complete guide, so please read this before posting anything. 

### Core vs Co-brand cards

The Core cards from HDFC are-
- Freedom
- Moneyback/+
- Millenia / DinersClub Millenia
- DinersClub Privilege 
- Regalia Gold 
- DinersClub Black Metal
- Infinia Metal

The Co-brand cards from HDFC are-
- Swiggy 
- Tata Neu
- Mariott Bonvoy 
- Indian Oil
- Indigo 6E
- IRCTC

And two more cards from HDFC within PayZapp that qualify as core cards for discounts are
- Pixel Play {split limit, not recommended unless first}
- Virtual RuPay 

For self-employed or business people, these are also counted as core cards -
- Business Moneyback 
- Biz First
- Biz Grow
- Business Regalia
- BizPower
- BizBlack

There are a few older variants of cards which may or may not be discontinued for fresh applications.
- DinersClub Black (non metal, but many got LTF)
- Infinia (non metal - some users migrated already, but some are still having their old plastic infinia LTF. )
- TimesCard 

### What should be my first HDFC Card?

You should take one of the ***core cards*** from HDFC, as whatever co-brand card you take later, it will share the credit limit with your existing HDFC card.

If you take co-brand cards first, you may be able to apply for other co brand cards, and they will share the limit, but the bank would make it either super difficult for you to get a core card, or ask you to close existing co-brand cards before applying for a core card. We are recently seeing people getting freedom card from PayTM app even after holding co-brand cards, but then moving up the core card ladder may take some time and efforts.

The Pixel Play card is weird because it asks you to split your limit towards that card, and it's an irreversible reaction. (I have heard of people who got pixel play, not being able to tranfer back the limit to their OG core card even before/after closing pixel) (update- there seems to be an option to transfer a limit back, but I won't believe it till I see it)

### Is my new card lifetime free?

If you apply from the website, you probably got the 'choose your card' page, and you were either shown the card you were looking for, or given a choice between three. In the bottom, in blue color ribbon, the card fees were mentioned, so take a screenshot of that while applying. If it says ""Life Time Free"", it means it IS free, and you won't be charged Joining fees or Annual/Renewal fees. 

Alternatively, if you applied from from Swiggy or Tata Neu app, take screenshot of your LTF offer there.

Once you get the card, send a mail to customer care to confirm if the card issued to you is LTF. They will reply to you within a day mostly. 

customerservices.cards[at]hdfcbank.com

First Year Free means that you WILL have to pay the Annual/Renewal fees for the card after the first year unless you meet the spend criteria. 
You can always email them and request for LTF conversion, but results may vary. 


### Is HDFC Swiggy Worth It?

***YES*** 
Absolutely, infact, it's better than Millenia especially with the rewards redemption fee. 

I'll go ahead and say that it is worth it despite the fees if your usage aligns with it. If you get it LTF, go for it. Pounce on the offer/card 

### Why is Swiggy not LTF for me?

We don't know. You should just wait for a few months, you will get the LTF offer. Till then, you can get SBI Cashback and/or Airtel Axis and/or HSBC Live+

### Which HDFC Card am I eligible for? Which cards can be offered via FD

A short while ago, this post was shared on the sub. It has the current eligibility criteria for the HDFC Card suite

https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/s/sZGbaKxl88

Refer to this above post to see the minimum limits, salary eligibility, government salary eligibility, ITR requirement and/or FD criteria (if available)

### HDFC is not offering me Limit Increase/Enhancement 

First check from your netbanking/app, and if you don't see an offer, Email their greviance redressal team. Usually HDFC rolls out LE offers between 20th-23rd of the month. 

### HDFC Card Upgrade

Same as above. Usually to move to DCBM or Infinia Metal is a tryst of its own, so tread with preparation. 
They may ask you to mail documents to their Chennai office, so you can either do this yourself or drop off documents at your nearest branch. They will mail it for you. 

The other upgrades may be FYF Regalia Gold or FYF DCP from Millenia. These are also good, but choose according to use case. 

### One Line Review of the following cards from my side-

#### Core
- **Freedom** - Great to get your foot in the door for HDFC Core Cards ladder and get the sale discounts.
- **Moneyback** - Slightly better than freedom, still basic. Milestones easy to hit to get gift vouchers.
- **Millenia** - Good cashbacks but lower caps. Redemption fees are bad. Prefer Swiggy HDFC over this, keep this for core discounts offers. Again, good and easy to hit milestones and get gift vouchers. 
- **DinersClub Millenia** - Same as Millenia, but on Diners Network. Poor acceptability.
- **DinersClub Privilege** - Great beginner card for lounge and movie benefits. Prefer if offered LTF over Millenia. Acceptance may be an issue. SmartBuy points make sense!
- **Regalia Gold** - Best beginner card for entering points and miles game. Amazing for lounge access. SmartBuy is super useful!{Atlas is better but costs twice and from a different bank}.
-  **DinersClub Black Metal** - Almost Infinia. 9.9% on GCs, 16.6% on Flights, 33% on Hotels through SmartBuy. Unlimited Lounge and Golf! Some milestone benefits are good too. High annual fees. 
- **Infinia Metal** - Apun ich bhagwaan hai.  

#### Co Brand
- **Swiggy** - Great for those who didn't get SBI Cashback. Better than Millenia as cashback comes in statement directly. 
- **Tata Neu Plus/Infinity** - Good ones. Infinity is better. Great for UPI if taken RuPay and spends in Tata ecosystem. Unconditional lounge access. 
- **Mariott Bonvoy** - Great for Mariott Silver states, one night stay and lounge access. 
- **Indian Oil** - good for fuel spends. RBL, SBI, Axis options should also be checked. 
- **Indigo 6E** - weird as the rewards program is not yet integrated with the Blue Chip ecosystem. Still looks good to me. Check as per your use case. 
- **IRCTC** - half decent. I've heard that there are too many cashback exclusions.

#### PayZapp
- **Pixel Play** - If you cannot get SBI Cashback, Millenia or Swiggy, then only look at this. 
- **Virtual RuPay** - no. Unless you started with a co-brand card and desperately need a HDFC Core card for FK/AZ sales or instant discount offers. 

#### Business Cards
- BizFirst, BizGrow, Business Moneyback - Basic Starter cards. Good for instant discounts.
- Business Regalia - Lounge was the only good perk, and even that has a spend criteria now. Won't recommend. 
- BizPower - This is good. But the rewards accelerator kicks in at 20k spends a month. Risky if you don't have fixed expenses. If you do, you can get good rewards! Great for tax payments. 
- BizBlack - Also great card. Especially alongside infinia. The reward rate is mind-blowing. Do note that this also has same issue as above, where you need X amount of spends for the rewards to kick in. The redemption is also through NetBanking.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/187g4mc/aitah_for_believing_my_daughter_over_a_grown_man/)**: November 30, 2023**

I don’t know if i watch too many crime shows or if I’m just paranoid so I’ve come here to ask. Last week I made chicken gnocchi soup. When it was almost done I started helping my daughter with a school project. She got us both a bowl and a few seconds later my bf runs into the room with a bowl and tells me to eat the bowl he has. I told him it was all the same and he insisted that he wanted mine because it had more chicken. Thinking back now I don’t know how he would know that considering my daughter dished it out. My daughter took the bowl he gave me and said she would eat it. He yanked it out of hand and said “no it’s for mom”.

I took the bowl and he went to the living room. I continued doing my daughter's project and told her not to eat the soup. 20ish minutes later I walked into the kitchen to pour the soups out and he was still eating his. He asked why we didn’t eat any and I said the cat got into it while we were waiting for it to cool down. He screamed “WHAT!? Was it your bowl !?! Cats can’t eat that!?”. I told him it was only a lick but he has been stressed out watching the cat like a hawk, obsessive even. His reaction was very weird.

*These ""accidents"" all happened before the soup incident over the span of 6 months. It wasn't one after another in a short period of time.* Since then my emergency money has gone missing. I keep money hidden just in case. I lost my older sister because she wasn’t able to escape a dangerous situation and I literally swore on her grave I would never be in that position. After the soup incident I went to get my money and it was gone. It was hidden and I changed the location every few months. I asked my daughter if maybe she found it and that if she took it I wouldn’t be mad because I knew she couldn’t have spent it. She said no. A few hours later she tells me she forgot but the other day her and my bf got pulled over and she saw my pink wallet in his glove box. I did not tell her which wallet it was in or that it was in a wallet.

I decided to ask him if he found it by accident. He asked me why I was hiding a large amount of money, “you know you could never leave me” and laughed. (He has never said anything like that before). I told him it was for my daughters Christmas. He said no he didn’t find the money but could use his credit card for gifts. I didn’t tell him about my daughter seeing my wallet in his car. Now here are a few other things that have happened in the past few months that seemed random at the time but now they don’t.

I have a severe allergy to latex. One day we were about to have sex and I glanced at the mirror we have by our bed and saw the condom wrapper was a different color. I stopped him because it wasn’t latex free and he said it was a mistake and just an older one he had. We have been dating for over 2 years and he knows how serious my allergy is. My epipen that I keep in my room is missing and I didn’t realize it. **I didn't realize it was missing until I was searching for my money.**

Another odd thing is one day he was following me down the stairs while I was carrying laundry and he kicked the back of my leg and I fell. He said he slipped but the stairs are wood and he was wearing his steel toe boots. At the time I thought it was an accident.

Am I overthinking this? My anxiety has been at an all time high. Do I watch too much true crime? Here is why I think I might be the asshole. We have a good relationship. He loves my daughter like she is his. We split all shared bills and we both pull our own weight around the apartment. We don’t fight. He has never so much as raised his voice at me. We are paycheck to paycheck but bills are paid.

I thought about going to my moms house for a few days and asking him when I get there when I’m safe about the money but I don’t have money to do that now. She is on a fixed income and can't help. I feel stupid for being scared. Last night I decided to check his car for my wallet and he caught me. I asked him for my money back and he tried playing dumb. I told him my daughter saw it there. He told me she was lying. I told him I never told her about the money or what wallet. He said he was a grown man and kids lie all the time. I asked him once more for my money and he said “I’m not giving you money to leave me”. I waited until he was in the shower to grab my cat and my daughter and we left.

I can’t take my cat with us to a shelter and the DV shelters are full. I was able to get us a night at a cheap motel. This exact situation is why I had money saved. I did everything right and now I’m screwed. I feel like I just blew up my entire life.

Yes I'm using a burner account and reading all the comments that I can.

***Relevant Comment:***

*Several people accuse this of being obviously fake because events escalated too quickly and why would she be posting on reddit for advice:*

""I'm not a character in a anonymous fucking story. I wasn't looking for advice, I was looking for confirmation I wasn't paranoid. You bet your ass I left as soon as he said my daughter was lying. Fuck off""

***There is no consensus bot on AITAH, but it was pretty obviously NTA***

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/18b29xf/update_aitah_for_believing_my_daughter_over_a/) **1: December 4, 2023 (4 days later)**

A TL:DR; I think my boyfriend put something in my soup. After that incident I remembered a few months ago he almost used a latex condom knowing I’m severely allergic and I also remembered when he “accidentally” knocked me down the stairs. I started piecing things together and realized my epi pen was gone as well as a large amount of money I had hidden. My daughter saw my old wallet in his glove box and he denied it.

My post got alot of attention and my account was shadowbanned for a few days. I was able to appeal and get my account back because I’m not a bot or some AI. Now for the update.

The day after we left he sent me a picture of my epi pen and tried telling me it was in my nightstand the whole time. I tore that room apart looking for it so I KNOW for 100% fact it wasn’t there. He took it. He tried getting me to come back telling me I scared myself stupid and watched too many true crime TV. Something didn't feel right so I told him to put my money and epi pen in the mailbox. We went back and forth and he denied having my money. He then said “If we broke up you and Maria (my daughter) are no longer allowed in my apartment and will be treated like trespassers” and sent me a pic of his target practice sheets. I went to the police about the money and was told it was a civil issue. I was upset but wanted the rest of my stuff so I asked for an escort.

Yesterday I finally got an escort into the apartment with a cop and my landlord. He destroyed everything of my daughters and he ruined the laptop charger I use for work. No epi pen. My daughters medication and back up medical supplies were ruined. Our landlord let me off the lease without having to pay an early termination fee which is great considering I have no money. Motels are expensive. I don’t want to get rid of our cat. All shelters are full and this is scary as shit.

I’m sorry this is a shitty update but I know people wanted it.

***Relevant Comments:***

*There has to be something that can be done about your daughter's meds:*

""I'm beyond angry that nothing can be done. Insurance won't cover her medications or supplies until next month. She JUST got refills. I can get her meds but I'll pay out of pocket. I have no money. Since I couldn't prove my money existed I can't prove he stole it. I'm livid.""

*Restraining order?*

""Nope not unless he gets physical with me. I should have let him hit me and I would have a lot more help available which is so fucked up.""

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/18f0zpx/final_update_aitah_for_believing_my_daughter_over/) **2: December 10, 2023 (6 days later, 10 days from OG post)**

My OP got a lot of attention but then my account got shadowbanned and was temporarily removed. I just updated 5 days ago but this will be my final update because there is nothing anyone can do. I was encouraged to go back to the police station after my last update.

On Saturday December 9th I went back AGAIN. This time I printed out the threatening text messages that included the target practice sheets he sent, I explained in detail about the “accidents” proving he was trying to hurt me, and I even had my landlord put in writing that he believed our lives were in danger after seeing everything I was showing the police and let me leave my lease early. I brought in the destroyed medical supplies and medications.

The police said they had already talked to him and said he didn’t do any of it. He told them my daughter probably destroyed her stuff because she is “special ed”. She has very mild Asperger's but doesn’t destroy things! Since it was his word against mine they believed him. I didn’t have proof he stole the money or that it even existed in the first place. I was told the epi pen was my responsibility and they won’t do anything if it’s lost. I was told to “let it go” and acted like I was bothering the police with my “petty civil issues”.

I am so defeated and angry. My daughter isn’t going to have gifts for Christmas because I have to save for a new deposit on an apartment. We have been staying in motels while I was reaching out to DV resources. I can’t get help without a restraining order/ police report. Every place is out of funds. He is getting away with everything and I’m so glad we got out because there is no doubt in my mind he would have gotten away with my murder.

I know this sounds like my last update but that is what happened…nothing new. No justice. No repercussions for him. He gets to stay in the apartment. My landlord offered me another unit across town but I can’t afford to move in. This exact situation is why I had money stashed away because no one has ever cared about me/us and I knew that. There is nothing else I can do.

**Editor's note:** OOP posted in another sub with the exact same information as above and no new update. However, she did add this clarification about shelters:

""All shelters are full. I found an organization who helps DV victims with housing but only if you have a police report and a restraining order. I guess they are tired of victims going back to their partner, safety reasons, or something. I was denied a restraining order because I had no proof. I’m scared, exhausted, and disappointed.""

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18tee21/i_thought_we_were_safe/) **3: December 28, 2023 (18 days later)**

**Title:** I thought we were safe

Alot of people wanted a update so here it is. On Christmas he slashed my tires knowing I would have to pay out of pocket to replace them which I don’t have. Today he threw a heavy patio chair through the window of the place we were staying at to let me know he knew where we were and I was asked to leave for everyone's safety.

Except my daughter and I aren’t safe. I walked in the sleet/snow with my daughter and our cat and I felt vulnerable and like open prey so we came back to the police station to sit in the lobby until morning. Shelters are still full and I now have to disclose that he is dangerous anywhere we go. Police couldn’t find him but I know he has to be close.

I don’t know what his end game is.

***Relevant Comments:***

*Can police direct you to a DV shelter?*

""The shelters here are full so we are just sitting in the police station lobby. We are at least safe and warm so I'm grateful for that.""

*On donations:*

""Donations aren't allowed here and my post could get removed because of it. I'm trying to stay awake and really just venting. I'm so frustrated that he keeps getting away with this shit.""

*Do you know how he keeps finding you? Have you checked for trackers?*

""I honestly have no idea! He is supposed to have a new girlfriend too so IDK why he is messing with me and destroying property""

*Reset your phone to factory settings:*

""I got a cheap burner after we left. He doesn't have my number nor have I used it to call anyone so IDK how he is tracking me.""

*You said he sent you a photo of the epi pen after you left. How did he communicate that to you?*

""He sent it through my email before I blocked it.""

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18whp26/i_found_the_air_tag_in_the_cat_carrier/) **4: January 1, 2024 (4 days later; a bit over 1 month from OG post)**

**Title:** I found the air tag in the cat carrier

Please read my other posts for more context but a tl:dr; I’m pretty sure my ex was/is trying to kill me. There were a few instances that I wrote off as “accidents'' until I think he poisoned my soup that was specifically for me. On Christmas he found where we were staying and slashed my tires and threw a heavy patio chair and planter through a window. He still hasn’t been caught.

I checked everywhere I could think of and still couldn't figure out how he was tracking us. I blocked him on everything including email after he sent me pics of his target practice sheets among other things. I got a cheap burner phone. My daughter was out of school for winter break so he didn’t follow her or anything. I checked my car for a tracker. Still nothing.

I do not have an iphone so I couldn’t check whatever app a air tag is attached to. My cat is harness trained and wears a collar but there was no tracker. Until today I decided to “feel up” (sorry only way I can describe it) the carrier. I ran my fingers over every inch of it and felt a bump on the bottom soft side. There was no new stitching or obvious cut. He had to use a seam ripper along the stitching. It was undetectable and I almost missed it. He had to have had help because I’ve never seen him sew anything. Probably the same person who is letting him hide now.

If his excuse for the air tag was to track my cat he would have put it on his collar or harness because that is what he would wear when we go on walks/car rides. My cat would never go in his carrier unless I was planning on leaving for more than a few days. I have no idea how long it has been there nor do I know how far the tracker works but now we aren’t safe where we are, AGAIN. I feel disgusting and I feel like hunted prey. This is so unnerving and I’m so uncomfortable. Who the f\*ck was I living with?

***Relevant Comment:***

>I’m sorry but I don’t find it believable that he tracked you with an AirTag.

I don't know how airtags work and didn't say that is how he is tracking me, just that I found one. It doesn't make sense how he knew where we were.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/190pogr/i_finally_got_the_restraining_order/) **5: January 7, 2024 (6 days later, 5.5 weeks from OG post)**

**Title:** I finally got the restraining order!

I’m hoping this update will make everyone as happy as it makes me! I was finally granted the restraining order. And we get the keys to our new apartment on the 11th. A place I can afford monthly and comes partially furnished. It’s in a super safe area right by my daughter's school. There is security!! We will spend our time living in our car until then and of course it has to be snowing but we are together and we have our kitty. This nightmare is almost over.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ahkvpt/a_restraining_order_didnt_stop_him/) **5: February 2, 2024 (almost 1 month later)**

**Title:** A restraining order didn't stop him

This morning he found me.

I've been sick as hell so after I dropped my daughter off at school I went straight home.

I didn't drive around to make sure no one was following me. I messed up.

He broke my nose and shattered my orbital bone. He is in jail. Sorry for this update ya'll.

""Staying in the hospital for the night, I was pretty sick before this happened. My daughter is with a friend for the night. My landlord fixed the door as best he could and told me my cat wasn't in the apartment so I'm worried sick. I thought this was over, I'm so so so tired.""

""I'm sure his mom will bail him out. Why can't he just move on? He took my money and my peace, what more can he take until he is satisfied?""

Commenter: Please pull your daughter out of her school and leave the state ASAP.

>**OOP:** I so wish I could do this but we just moved into our new place. I should have just stayed with my mom (she lives in another state) but I didn't want to disrupt my daughters life too much. I have three dollars to my name so I can't leave.

>My previous landlord let me out of my lease without a penalty and my new one will too I just can't afford to move.

**Title:** Not being able to move even if my life depends on it

I know the importance of having money saved and I live within my means. How many of us is one disaster away from losing everything? A fire, job loss, a bank screw up, a late paycheck, illness, or someone stealing from you. I had money saved because I knew that any one of those things could happen and I wouldn't have anyone who could help me. And it did. Two months ago my ex tried poisoning me and stole the money I had saved. It’s been hell since. I was able to break my lease and leave. I went to my moms over Christmas break but I came back because I didn’t want to disrupt my daughters schooling and I underestimated my ex.

I was able to get an apartment through DV services very quickly which was a miracle. I know how hard it is to find housing and then try to come up with all the deposits a new place needs. I did it, the cards fell in my favor. But then I fucked up. On Friday I took my daughter to school and wasn’t diligent. I will usually drive around to make sure I’m not being followed. To be honest I started feeling crazy, paranoid, and angry I was wasting gas. Plus I have pneumonia and strep that I haven’t been able to pay for the antibiotics so I just went home to my bed.

He found me and broke my nose, shattered my orbital bone, and I have a concussion. I had a restraining order and he was arrested. I shared this on another sub and everyone telling me to move, leave, RUN. Except I can’t do that. It’s hard trying to explain that to people for them to understand because it sounds like excuses, like I like living in fear or something. I can’t pull money out of thin air. My credit card is maxed. I contacted DV services at the hospital and because I just got help, I can’t get it again.

The thing I didn’t know about abusive men is that they don’t just move on or stop. There are DV shelters but they are full. I wish people would understand that I know how serious this is but money doesn’t grow on trees. Even if a life depends on it.

***Relevant Comments:***

*Will your parents really not help you?*

I only have my mom who lives out of state. She is on a fixed income so she can't help me. We could stay with her but at this point I'm out of luck and nothing worth a damn to sell.

*You need to disappear:*

Honestly how? I'm not going to get anywhere on foot.

**Title:** He was with me to get to my daughter

It all makes sense now. If you need more context please read my past posts. In my first post I said how we had a normal relationship and he was never abusive, controlling, never raised his voice. The money that he ended up stealing was money I had hidden since before he even moved in. I was not hiding money to get away from him. I was not afraid of him. I lost my sister to DV and swore I’d never have that happen to me only to end up in that exact situation. We didn’t have this spectacular love that was filled with insane chemistry, nowhere near a “love of my life” situation which is why I was so confused by how desperate he got.

After he got arrested his mom went on a social media rant because I “got her baby locked up” and knew we were sleeping in my car so was telling her followers that if they find me to call her. Very bold and insane. One of my exes friends saw this and commented “Idk if you should be sticking up for him, he needs serious help”. I don’t know how I caught it before it was deleted but I reached out to him on my fake facebook.

Every time they were drinking he would talk about her and then laugh it off. It made his friends uncomfortable but they chalked it up to the booze. Two weeks ago when my daughter came to see me in the hospital she was distraught. It made sense because I looked like hell but she kept repeating over and over asking me why he did this to me. I think there was more to this and I’m frightened to my core. Remember he stole my epi pen and money but he destroyed almost everything of hers and I didn't understand it because she had nothing to do with the breakup.

Why did he destroy her medicine? Why did he destroy her clothes? Fucking why? Dont abusers threaten their victim into not saying anything or something is going to happen to someone/something they love? I’m sick to my stomach even writing that out. I don’t know where to go from here, how do I even begin a conversation about this with her? We are safe. I’m not worried about him finding us because he is still in jail which is great because I’m out of money. He wasn’t desperate and crazy because he was losing me, I think it was because of her.

I'm so angry and scared.

I wish I had faith in the justice system and with cops because they are supposed to protect, right? Except that isn't always the case.

I'm tired of being hurt and I'm tired of being scared. Anxiety is on 100.

It's exhausting fearing my daughter and I's life.

**Title:** How can I feel safer at home?

I know a lot of people are following my posts and will be disappointed in hearing that my ex was bailed out. I’m still healing from when he broke my nose and shattered my orbital bone. I know a restraining order is just a piece of paper because he ignored it when I was attacked and the police aren’t going to save me. For security I only have a door bar that slides under the knob. I don’t have a ring camera and I can’t buy a pew pew until I have extra funds. He made me sell it a year ago because he was “uncomfortable” with it being in the house. Another red flag I missed.

My question is what can I do to feel safer that doesn’t require money? Every night my daughter and I push the couch in front of the door but I’m worried that if there is a fire we can’t get out. I have myself worried sick to the point of painful stomach ulcers. I tried talking to my nearest neighbor but when I started explaining my situation and how it would be great if she could let me know if she sees anyone around my apartment she got weirded out. Which I get.

Just looking for some peace of mind, will that ever exist in my life again?

**Title:** AITAH or was this just a mistake?

**Editor's note:** I removed the first part of this as it is a recap of the previous posts

I know this is all I post about and if you want more context you can read my past posts. I feel like I need to tell someone what is happening so that it makes it feel real and that I’m not just upset and crazy for nothing. My ex got out on bail last week. My daughter and I already left the new apartment we had moved into after he attacked me.

My daughter's school knows about my situation and knows I have a restraining order. Today my daughter got a call from the front office at school. The secretary told her that the pickup car had changed from mine to a new car. She was being told this so that when school let out she wouldn’t get upset when she didn’t see my car. The “new car” is the same one as my exes. It is a rare car/color and she told me she knew it was his car. She didn’t say anything to the secretary or her teacher because she was instantly scared. It breaks my heart that she was in fear because she thought he had got me and was going to get her.

She was given the message hours before school let out so she spent all that time worrying. The last ten minutes of the day is when the kids can use the bathroom and clean up. She started crying infront of her whole class and when the bell rang she refused to leave her classroom. I was in the carpool line when I got the call from her teacher.

I have never seen her so upset and that is saying a lot because she was so upset when she visited me in the hospital. Face beet red, hyperventilating, snot everywhere, she had cried so hard she got a nosebleed. After they told me what happened I was livid. It all sounded like bullshit because the secretary never should have relayed the message without talking to me first since she said it was a male on the phone. As soon as the secretary looked my daughter up to find out which room to call she should have seen the message I thought I had saying no one should ever pick her up but me. No information should ever be released.

“He was never in contact with her so it’s not that big of a deal, it was a mistake” is what they told me. All he had to give was her full name and what grade she was in to get a message to her. They said that to me with a straight face while the bruises he gave me were very visible proving he is a violent man. I’m so f\*cking angry. She told me she knew I didn’t get a new car because as much as I try to hide it from her she knows I’m broke. She thought she was going to have to go with him. She has been so traumatized and I don't know what to do. She wants to switch to e learning but since it’s not a medical reason and not a school wide restriction I would have to pay to rent the laptop. Which I obviously can’t.

The school is calling it an innocent mistake and didn't even apologize. I know I'm the only one responsible for my daughter and I’s safety but damn if people could stop jeopardizing it like it’s nothing and then acting like I’m the asshole for being upset because it was a “mistake”. He wasn’t there after school but he could have.

I've had a few people asking so I wanted to update. I can now confidently say that my daughter, cat, and I are safe and will continue to be from here on out. I can start rebuilding without fear. I'm not okay but we are safe.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1cb1rl7/ive_spent_the_last_4_months_running_for_my_life/) **13: April 23, 2024 (3 weeks later, almost 5 months from OG post)**

**Title:** I’ve spent the last 4 months running for my life

I just want to say that if anyone is going through something similar to me, you can vent to me. This is something you have to experience to understand how hard it is. I know there are DV resources but they are extremely limited. I had someone on here “checking in” with me and when I explained what was going on I was asked “why aren’t you stable yet” and it kinda took me off guard. Only a few people knew I was pregnant through this.

I left my home with basically nothing and went to a hotel and he found me, I went to another hotel and he found me, I went to a safe house for two nights where I was asked to leave because my ex was dangerous, slept in my car with my daughter, went to my moms out of state, came back to my home state because that is where DV resources helped with a apartment, he followed me back to my apartment from my daughters school, I was hospitalized when he broke my nose, shattered my orbital bone, and gave me a concussion. I had to leave that apt, back to hotels and sleeping in my car, and finally back to my moms. So much money feels wasted. I have the opportunity to be added onto her new lease but it’s a bigger unit and requires a first/last deposit (impossible unless I rob a bank). The pet deposit is already paid.

But I only have until the 1st or we are back to living in the car because we have exceeded our “visitation” days. A year lease where my rent would only be $500 a month, utilities maybe $150? I’d be saving so much money and be able to rebuild my life. We would all have our own rooms which means privacy! Even though we are all female, privacy is precious. I haven’t slept in a bed since the hotel beds but even then it wasn’t “my” bed. It’s been my car, hotel bed, or the couch. Even when we were briefly in our new place I still slept on the couch with it pushed against the front door.

I know all my posts are about the same thing, one thing after another, and yes it IS exhausting and repetitive but think about how I feel. I’m desperate for stability and I can’t get it because he took so much from me. It wasn’t until I was out of “our” house and away from him for me to see how much power he had over my life. It’s embarrassing. Even if I have to go back to living in my car I’ll still be around to talk and I’ll still be optimistic because I deserve good things to happen to me that aren't only in my dreams.

***Clarification on the air tag:***

There was! Someone helped him put one in my cat's carrier because he knew if I was going to leave, I'd never leave my cat behind.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1cx0h9l/the_vet_gave_my_abuser_my_location/) **14: May 21, 2024 (1 month later, almost 6 from OG post)**

**Title:** The vet gave my abuser my location

I want to say this was a genuine mistake and not done with malicious intent but I still need to vent about it. Just like my daughter's school letting my abuser give her a message, this was an accident but accidents put my life in danger and I’m exhausted. I post about my situation alot and despite a few users thinking my ex would find my reddit, I’m not worried about that. However, I am terrified of him knowing where I am. He has gone through a restraining order, police don’t scare him, and when he got/gets arrested he will just get bailed out. I knew the only way I could live a normal life was getting as far away from him as possible.

So I took my daughter and cat and moved in with my mom a few states away. I was 100% confident that he didn’t know where I was because they never met, we were actually estranged for a few years before my ex and I even got together. I started feeling safe. I stopped jumping when I heard loud trucks. I was starting to get comfortable even though not alot of time had passed.

A few days ago my cat's back legs stopped working and he lost control of his bodily fluids.I was working but my mom rushed him to the ER vet. There were questions she couldn’t answer so they asked if he was chipped. He is but I changed my number a few times lately so one of the two numbers was out of service so they called the second one. I forgot to remove his number, I know this is my fault. The vet called him to get information and he didn’t give any information and hung up on them. The receptionist said he called back about 5 minutes later and said “I know she doesn’t have money. Tell her I’ll save her cat if she comes home”.

He knows how much my cat means to me. He found me the first time I left because his mom helped him sew an air tag into the lining of the cat carrier. He knew if I was to ever leave him I wouldn’t leave my cat. One time my ex threw him out of the house to hurt me while I was at work he refused to leave the porch. My ex then tried squirting him with a water bottle and when that didn’t work, he sprayed him with the hose. He basically got waterboarded and still would not leave.

He is my soul cat. When I got to the vet and they told me what happened I had one of the worst panic attacks I’ve had in awhile. I’ve had my cat for ten years and he has never gotten sick or injured. He has a UTI and a fractured foot from falling. The vet thinks he probably got his foot hurt first and that led to the UTI since he wasn’t using the litter box. I noticed he was slightly limping a few days ago but I couldn’t get him into the vet yet. The UTI developed quickly. I was naive in thinking the vet would save a pet's life even if the owner can’t pay upfront but it isn’t like a human going into the ER.

I’ve spent so much money and time trying to get away from my ex while also trying to live a normal safe life for my daughter. Once again something happens and he now knows the city we are in. I’m not running again because I can’t. I don’t think he will drive up here because like I said I’m a few states away but man did this bring back my paranoia and irrational fear.

I changed the chip information but the damage is done, I was a fucking idiot for not doing it sooner. This is my fault, I'm so damn tired.

***Relevant Comments:***

Commenter: Why did they use the microchip to get your number? Did your mom not have your most recent number to give them or something? Could you not be reached at work? That’s just weird to me.

>**OOP:** My mom was flustered because she knew the ER vet was going to be expensive and knew I couldn't pay but she couldn't answer any questions because she didn't know. Didn't know how old he was or if he had his shots. I can't take my phone into my work building and she didn't know the manager's phone number.  
>  
>I was able to pay partial with scratchpay but not all which is heartbreaking. A broken heart and frustrating anger is what I feel too.

Commenter: I just don’t understand why the vet would go through the trouble of scanning the chip and calling the numbers on there instead of just asking your mom for your number?? Seems like a lot of grief could have been avoided and the clinic had to do more work to call a company and get the phone numbers.

>**OOP:** I've had to change my number over 6 times in a three month time span, my mom didn't know it off the top of her head.

Commenter: If you are communicating with your mom it would be in her phone. If it changes so often, the last number in her phone would be more accurate than a microchip which is less likely to be updated. This is very strange.

>**OOP:** I was at work, I can not have my personal phone on me and my cat was having a medical emergency. My mom didn't know how old my cat is or if he had his shots. They had alot of questions she had no answer to so they scanned the chip to get information.

**Editor's note:** Some people commented on the first BORU that OOP's ex was a police officer. However, I can't find anything in OOP's posts or comments that confirms this, nor has she said anything about it. (Nothing shows up when checking deleted comments either.)

I don’t know if i watch too many crime shows or if I’m just paranoid so I’ve come here to ask. Last week I made chicken gnocchi soup. When it was almost done I started helping my daughter with a school project. She got us both a bowl and a few seconds later my bf runs into the room with a bowl and tells me to eat the bowl he has. I told him it was all the same and he insisted that he wanted mine because it had more chicken. Thinking back now I don’t know how he would know that considering my daughter dished it out. My daughter took the bowl he gave me and said she would eat it. He yanked it out of hand and said “no it’s for mom”.

I took the bowl and he went to the living room. I continued doing my daughter's project and told her not to eat the soup. 20ish minutes later I walked into the kitchen to pour the soups out and he was still eating his. He asked why we didn’t eat any and I said the cat got into it while we were waiting for it to cool down. He screamed “WHAT!? Was it your bowl !?! Cats can’t eat that!?”. I told him it was only a lick but he has been stressed out watching the cat like a hawk, obsessive even. His reaction was very weird.

*These ""accidents"" all happened before the soup incident over the span of 6 months. It wasn't one after another in a short period of time.* Since then my emergency money has gone missing. I keep money hidden just in case. I lost my older sister because she wasn’t able to escape a dangerous situation and I literally swore on her grave I would never be in that position. After the soup incident I went to get my money and it was gone. It was hidden and I changed the location every few months. I asked my daughter if maybe she found it and that if she took it I wouldn’t be mad because I knew she couldn’t have spent it. She said no. A few hours later she tells me she forgot but the other day her and my bf got pulled over and she saw my pink wallet in his glove box. I did not tell her which wallet it was in or that it was in a wallet.

I decided to ask him if he found it by accident. He asked me why I was hiding a large amount of money, “you know you could never leave me” and laughed. (He has never said anything like that before). I told him it was for my daughters Christmas. He said no he didn’t find the money but could use his credit card for gifts. I didn’t tell him about my daughter seeing my wallet in his car. Now here are a few other things that have happened in the past few months that seemed random at the time but now they don’t.

I have a severe allergy to latex. One day we were about to have sex and I glanced at the mirror we have by our bed and saw the condom wrapper was a different color. I stopped him because it wasn’t latex free and he said it was a mistake and just an older one he had. We have been dating for over 2 years and he knows how serious my allergy is. My epipen that I keep in my room is missing and I didn’t realize it. **I didn't realize it was missing until I was searching for my money.**

Another odd thing is one day he was following me down the stairs while I was carrying laundry and he kicked the back of my leg and I fell. He said he slipped but the stairs are wood and he was wearing his steel toe boots. At the time I thought it was an accident.

Am I overthinking this? My anxiety has been at an all time high. Do I watch too much true crime? Here is why I think I might be the asshole. We have a good relationship. He loves my daughter like she is his. We split all shared bills and we both pull our own weight around the apartment. We don’t fight. He has never so much as raised his voice at me. We are paycheck to paycheck but bills are paid.

I thought about going to my moms house for a few days and asking him when I get there when I’m safe about the money but I don’t have money to do that now. She is on a fixed income and can't help. I feel stupid for being scared. Last night I decided to check his car for my wallet and he caught me. I asked him for my money back and he tried playing dumb. I told him my daughter saw it there. He told me she was lying. I told him I never told her about the money or what wallet. He said he was a grown man and kids lie all the time. I asked him once more for my money and he said “I’m not giving you money to leave me”. I waited until he was in the shower to grab my cat and my daughter and we left.

I can’t take my cat with us to a shelter and the DV shelters are full. I was able to get us a night at a cheap motel. This exact situation is why I had money saved. I did everything right and now I’m screwed. I feel like I just blew up my entire life.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/18b29xf/update_aitah_for_believing_my_daughter_over_a/) **1: December 4, 2023 (4 days later)**

A TL:DR; I think my boyfriend put something in my soup. After that incident I remembered a few months ago he almost used a latex condom knowing I’m severely allergic and I also remembered when he “accidentally” knocked me down the stairs. I started piecing things together and realized my epi pen was gone as well as a large amount of money I had hidden. My daughter saw my old wallet in his glove box and he denied it.

My post got alot of attention and my account was shadowbanned for a few days. I was able to appeal and get my account back because I’m not a bot or some AI. Now for the update.

The day after we left he sent me a picture of my epi pen and tried telling me it was in my nightstand the whole time. I tore that room apart looking for it so I KNOW for 100% fact it wasn’t there. He took it. He tried getting me to come back telling me I scared myself stupid and watched too many true crime TV. Something didn't feel right so I told him to put my money and epi pen in the mailbox. We went back and forth and he denied having my money. He then said “If we broke up you and Maria (my daughter) are no longer allowed in my apartment and will be treated like trespassers” and sent me a pic of his target practice sheets. I went to the police about the money and was told it was a civil issue. I was upset but wanted the rest of my stuff so I asked for an escort.

Yesterday I finally got an escort into the apartment with a cop and my landlord. He destroyed everything of my daughters and he ruined the laptop charger I use for work. No epi pen. My daughters medication and back up medical supplies were ruined. Our landlord let me off the lease without having to pay an early termination fee which is great considering I have no money. Motels are expensive. I don’t want to get rid of our cat. All shelters are full and this is scary as shit.

I’m sorry this is a shitty update but I know people wanted it.

""Nope not unless he gets physical with me. I should have let him hit me and I would have a lot more help available which is so fucked up.""

My OP got a lot of attention but then my account got shadowbanned and was temporarily removed. I just updated 5 days ago but this will be my final update because there is nothing anyone can do. I was encouraged to go back to the police station after my last update.

On Saturday December 9th I went back AGAIN. This time I printed out the threatening text messages that included the target practice sheets he sent, I explained in detail about the “accidents” proving he was trying to hurt me, and I even had my landlord put in writing that he believed our lives were in danger after seeing everything I was showing the police and let me leave my lease early. I brought in the destroyed medical supplies and medications.

The police said they had already talked to him and said he didn’t do any of it. He told them my daughter probably destroyed her stuff because she is “special ed”. She has very mild Asperger's but doesn’t destroy things! Since it was his word against mine they believed him. I didn’t have proof he stole the money or that it even existed in the first place. I was told the epi pen was my responsibility and they won’t do anything if it’s lost. I was told to “let it go” and acted like I was bothering the police with my “petty civil issues”.

I am so defeated and angry. My daughter isn’t going to have gifts for Christmas because I have to save for a new deposit on an apartment. We have been staying in motels while I was reaching out to DV resources. I can’t get help without a restraining order/ police report. Every place is out of funds. He is getting away with everything and I’m so glad we got out because there is no doubt in my mind he would have gotten away with my murder.

I know this sounds like my last update but that is what happened…nothing new. No justice. No repercussions for him. He gets to stay in the apartment. My landlord offered me another unit across town but I can’t afford to move in. This exact situation is why I had money stashed away because no one has ever cared about me/us and I knew that. There is nothing else I can do.

**Editor's note:** OOP posted in another sub with the exact same information as above and no new update. However, she did add this clarification about shelters:

""All shelters are full. I found an organization who helps DV victims with housing but only if you have a police report and a restraining order. I guess they are tired of victims going back to their partner, safety reasons, or something. I was denied a restraining order because I had no proof. I’m scared, exhausted, and disappointed.""

**Title:** I thought we were safe

Alot of people wanted a update so here it is. On Christmas he slashed my tires knowing I would have to pay out of pocket to replace them which I don’t have. Today he threw a heavy patio chair through the window of the place we were staying at to let me know he knew where we were and I was asked to leave for everyone's safety.

Except my daughter and I aren’t safe. I walked in the sleet/snow with my daughter and our cat and I felt vulnerable and like open prey so we came back to the police station to sit in the lobby until morning. Shelters are still full and I now have to disclose that he is dangerous anywhere we go. Police couldn’t find him but I know he has to be close.

I don’t know what his end game is.

**Title:** I found the air tag in the cat carrier

Please read my other posts for more context but a tl:dr; I’m pretty sure my ex was/is trying to kill me. There were a few instances that I wrote off as “accidents'' until I think he poisoned my soup that was specifically for me. On Christmas he found where we were staying and slashed my tires and threw a heavy patio chair and planter through a window. He still hasn’t been caught.

I checked everywhere I could think of and still couldn't figure out how he was tracking us. I blocked him on everything including email after he sent me pics of his target practice sheets among other things. I got a cheap burner phone. My daughter was out of school for winter break so he didn’t follow her or anything. I checked my car for a tracker. Still nothing.

I do not have an iphone so I couldn’t check whatever app a air tag is attached to. My cat is harness trained and wears a collar but there was no tracker. Until today I decided to “feel up” (sorry only way I can describe it) the carrier. I ran my fingers over every inch of it and felt a bump on the bottom soft side. There was no new stitching or obvious cut. He had to use a seam ripper along the stitching. It was undetectable and I almost missed it. He had to have had help because I’ve never seen him sew anything. Probably the same person who is letting him hide now.

If his excuse for the air tag was to track my cat he would have put it on his collar or harness because that is what he would wear when we go on walks/car rides. My cat would never go in his carrier unless I was planning on leaving for more than a few days. I have no idea how long it has been there nor do I know how far the tracker works but now we aren’t safe where we are, AGAIN. I feel disgusting and I feel like hunted prey. This is so unnerving and I’m so uncomfortable. Who the f\*ck was I living with?

***Relevant Comment:***

>I’m sorry but I don’t find it believable that he tracked you with an AirTag.

I don't know how airtags work and didn't say that is how he is tracking me, just that I found one. It doesn't make sense how he knew where we were.

**Title:** I finally got the restraining order!

I’m hoping this update will make everyone as happy as it makes me! I was finally granted the restraining order. And we get the keys to our new apartment on the 11th. A place I can afford monthly and comes partially furnished. It’s in a super safe area right by my daughter's school. There is security!! We will spend our time living in our car until then and of course it has to be snowing but we are together and we have our kitty. This nightmare is almost over.

This morning he found me.

I've been sick as hell so after I dropped my daughter off at school I went straight home.

I didn't drive around to make sure no one was following me. I messed up.

He broke my nose and shattered my orbital bone. He is in jail. Sorry for this update ya'll.

""Staying in the hospital for the night, I was pretty sick before this happened. My daughter is with a friend for the night. My landlord fixed the door as best he could and told me my cat wasn't in the apartment so I'm worried sick. I thought this was over, I'm so so so tired.""

""I'm sure his mom will bail him out. Why can't he just move on? He took my money and my peace, what more can he take until he is satisfied?""

Commenter: Please pull your daughter out of her school and leave the state ASAP.

>**OOP:** I so wish I could do this but we just moved into our new place. I should have just stayed with my mom (she lives in another state) but I didn't want to disrupt my daughters life too much. I have three dollars to my name so I can't leave.

**Title:** Not being able to move even if my life depends on it

I know the importance of having money saved and I live within my means. How many of us is one disaster away from losing everything? A fire, job loss, a bank screw up, a late paycheck, illness, or someone stealing from you. I had money saved because I knew that any one of those things could happen and I wouldn't have anyone who could help me. And it did. Two months ago my ex tried poisoning me and stole the money I had saved. It’s been hell since. I was able to break my lease and leave. I went to my moms over Christmas break but I came back because I didn’t want to disrupt my daughters schooling and I underestimated my ex.

I was able to get an apartment through DV services very quickly which was a miracle. I know how hard it is to find housing and then try to come up with all the deposits a new place needs. I did it, the cards fell in my favor. But then I fucked up. On Friday I took my daughter to school and wasn’t diligent. I will usually drive around to make sure I’m not being followed. To be honest I started feeling crazy, paranoid, and angry I was wasting gas. Plus I have pneumonia and strep that I haven’t been able to pay for the antibiotics so I just went home to my bed.

He found me and broke my nose, shattered my orbital bone, and I have a concussion. I had a restraining order and he was arrested. I shared this on another sub and everyone telling me to move, leave, RUN. Except I can’t do that. It’s hard trying to explain that to people for them to understand because it sounds like excuses, like I like living in fear or something. I can’t pull money out of thin air. My credit card is maxed. I contacted DV services at the hospital and because I just got help, I can’t get it again.

The thing I didn’t know about abusive men is that they don’t just move on or stop. There are DV shelters but they are full. I wish people would understand that I know how serious this is but money doesn’t grow on trees. Even if a life depends on it.

***Relevant Comments:***

*Will your parents really not help you?*

I only have my mom who lives out of state. She is on a fixed income so she can't help me. We could stay with her but at this point I'm out of luck and nothing worth a damn to sell.

*You need to disappear:*

Honestly how? I'm not going to get anywhere on foot.

**Title:** He was with me to get to my daughter

It all makes sense now. If you need more context please read my past posts. In my first post I said how we had a normal relationship and he was never abusive, controlling, never raised his voice. The money that he ended up stealing was money I had hidden since before he even moved in. I was not hiding money to get away from him. I was not afraid of him. I lost my sister to DV and swore I’d never have that happen to me only to end up in that exact situation. We didn’t have this spectacular love that was filled with insane chemistry, nowhere near a “love of my life” situation which is why I was so confused by how desperate he got.

After he got arrested his mom went on a social media rant because I “got her baby locked up” and knew we were sleeping in my car so was telling her followers that if they find me to call her. Very bold and insane. One of my exes friends saw this and commented “Idk if you should be sticking up for him, he needs serious help”. I don’t know how I caught it before it was deleted but I reached out to him on my fake facebook.

Every time they were drinking he would talk about her and then laugh it off. It made his friends uncomfortable but they chalked it up to the booze. Two weeks ago when my daughter came to see me in the hospital she was distraught. It made sense because I looked like hell but she kept repeating over and over asking me why he did this to me. I think there was more to this and I’m frightened to my core. Remember he stole my epi pen and money but he destroyed almost everything of hers and I didn't understand it because she had nothing to do with the breakup.

Why did he destroy her medicine? Why did he destroy her clothes? Fucking why? Dont abusers threaten their victim into not saying anything or something is going to happen to someone/something they love? I’m sick to my stomach even writing that out. I don’t know where to go from here, how do I even begin a conversation about this with her? We are safe. I’m not worried about him finding us because he is still in jail which is great because I’m out of money. He wasn’t desperate and crazy because he was losing me, I think it was because of her.

I'm so angry and scared.

I wish I had faith in the justice system and with cops because they are supposed to protect, right? Except that isn't always the case.

I'm tired of being hurt and I'm tired of being scared. Anxiety is on 100.

It's exhausting fearing my daughter and I's life.

**Title:** How can I feel safer at home?

I know a lot of people are following my posts and will be disappointed in hearing that my ex was bailed out. I’m still healing from when he broke my nose and shattered my orbital bone. I know a restraining order is just a piece of paper because he ignored it when I was attacked and the police aren’t going to save me. For security I only have a door bar that slides under the knob. I don’t have a ring camera and I can’t buy a pew pew until I have extra funds. He made me sell it a year ago because he was “uncomfortable” with it being in the house. Another red flag I missed.

My question is what can I do to feel safer that doesn’t require money? Every night my daughter and I push the couch in front of the door but I’m worried that if there is a fire we can’t get out. I have myself worried sick to the point of painful stomach ulcers. I tried talking to my nearest neighbor but when I started explaining my situation and how it would be great if she could let me know if she sees anyone around my apartment she got weirded out. Which I get.

Just looking for some peace of mind, will that ever exist in my life again?

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1b7wkcf/aitah_or_was_this_just_a_mistake/) **10: March 6, 2024 (1 week later)**

**Title:** AITAH or was this just a mistake?

**Editor's note:** I removed the first part of this as it is a recap of the previous posts

I know this is all I post about and if you want more context you can read my past posts. I feel like I need to tell someone what is happening so that it makes it feel real and that I’m not just upset and crazy for nothing. My ex got out on bail last week. My daughter and I already left the new apartment we had moved into after he attacked me.

My daughter's school knows about my situation and knows I have a restraining order. Today my daughter got a call from the front office at school. The secretary told her that the pickup car had changed from mine to a new car. She was being told this so that when school let out she wouldn’t get upset when she didn’t see my car. The “new car” is the same one as my exes. It is a rare car/color and she told me she knew it was his car. She didn’t say anything to the secretary or her teacher because she was instantly scared. It breaks my heart that she was in fear because she thought he had got me and was going to get her.

She was given the message hours before school let out so she spent all that time worrying. The last ten minutes of the day is when the kids can use the bathroom and clean up. She started crying infront of her whole class and when the bell rang she refused to leave her classroom. I was in the carpool line when I got the call from her teacher.

I have never seen her so upset and that is saying a lot because she was so upset when she visited me in the hospital. Face beet red, hyperventilating, snot everywhere, she had cried so hard she got a nosebleed. After they told me what happened I was livid. It all sounded like bullshit because the secretary never should have relayed the message without talking to me first since she said it was a male on the phone. As soon as the secretary looked my daughter up to find out which room to call she should have seen the message I thought I had saying no one should ever pick her up but me. No information should ever be released.

“He was never in contact with her so it’s not that big of a deal, it was a mistake” is what they told me. All he had to give was her full name and what grade she was in to get a message to her. They said that to me with a straight face while the bruises he gave me were very visible proving he is a violent man. I’m so f\*cking angry. She told me she knew I didn’t get a new car because as much as I try to hide it from her she knows I’m broke. She thought she was going to have to go with him. She has been so traumatized and I don't know what to do. She wants to switch to e learning but since it’s not a medical reason and not a school wide restriction I would have to pay to rent the laptop. Which I obviously can’t.

The school is calling it an innocent mistake and didn't even apologize. I know I'm the only one responsible for my daughter and I’s safety but damn if people could stop jeopardizing it like it’s nothing and then acting like I’m the asshole for being upset because it was a “mistake”. He wasn’t there after school but he could have.

I've had a few people asking so I wanted to update. I can now confidently say that my daughter, cat, and I are safe and will continue to be from here on out. I can start rebuilding without fear. I'm not okay but we are safe.

**Title:** I’ve spent the last 4 months running for my life

I just want to say that if anyone is going through something similar to me, you can vent to me. This is something you have to experience to understand how hard it is. I know there are DV resources but they are extremely limited. I had someone on here “checking in” with me and when I explained what was going on I was asked “why aren’t you stable yet” and it kinda took me off guard. Only a few people knew I was pregnant through this.

I left my home with basically nothing and went to a hotel and he found me, I went to another hotel and he found me, I went to a safe house for two nights where I was asked to leave because my ex was dangerous, slept in my car with my daughter, went to my moms out of state, came back to my home state because that is where DV resources helped with a apartment, he followed me back to my apartment from my daughters school, I was hospitalized when he broke my nose, shattered my orbital bone, and gave me a concussion. I had to leave that apt, back to hotels and sleeping in my car, and finally back to my moms. So much money feels wasted. I have the opportunity to be added onto her new lease but it’s a bigger unit and requires a first/last deposit (impossible unless I rob a bank). The pet deposit is already paid.

But I only have until the 1st or we are back to living in the car because we have exceeded our “visitation” days. A year lease where my rent would only be $500 a month, utilities maybe $150? I’d be saving so much money and be able to rebuild my life. We would all have our own rooms which means privacy! Even though we are all female, privacy is precious. I haven’t slept in a bed since the hotel beds but even then it wasn’t “my” bed. It’s been my car, hotel bed, or the couch. Even when we were briefly in our new place I still slept on the couch with it pushed against the front door.

I know all my posts are about the same thing, one thing after another, and yes it IS exhausting and repetitive but think about how I feel. I’m desperate for stability and I can’t get it because he took so much from me. It wasn’t until I was out of “our” house and away from him for me to see how much power he had over my life. It’s embarrassing. Even if I have to go back to living in my car I’ll still be around to talk and I’ll still be optimistic because I deserve good things to happen to me that aren't only in my dreams.

***Clarification on the air tag:***

There was! Someone helped him put one in my cat's carrier because he knew if I was going to leave, I'd never leave my cat behind.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1cx0h9l/the_vet_gave_my_abuser_my_location/) **14: May 21, 2024 (1 month later, almost 6 from OG post)**

**Title:** The vet gave my abuser my location

I want to say this was a genuine mistake and not done with malicious intent but I still need to vent about it. Just like my daughter's school letting my abuser give her a message, this was an accident but accidents put my life in danger and I’m exhausted. I post about my situation alot and despite a few users thinking my ex would find my reddit, I’m not worried about that. However, I am terrified of him knowing where I am. He has gone through a restraining order, police don’t scare him, and when he got/gets arrested he will just get bailed out. I knew the only way I could live a normal life was getting as far away from him as possible.

So I took my daughter and cat and moved in with my mom a few states away. I was 100% confident that he didn’t know where I was because they never met, we were actually estranged for a few years before my ex and I even got together. I started feeling safe. I stopped jumping when I heard loud trucks. I was starting to get comfortable even though not alot of time had passed.

A few days ago my cat's back legs stopped working and he lost control of his bodily fluids.I was working but my mom rushed him to the ER vet. There were questions she couldn’t answer so they asked if he was chipped. He is but I changed my number a few times lately so one of the two numbers was out of service so they called the second one. I forgot to remove his number, I know this is my fault. The vet called him to get information and he didn’t give any information and hung up on them. The receptionist said he called back about 5 minutes later and said “I know she doesn’t have money. Tell her I’ll save her cat if she comes home”.

He knows how much my cat means to me. He found me the first time I left because his mom helped him sew an air tag into the lining of the cat carrier. He knew if I was to ever leave him I wouldn’t leave my cat. One time my ex threw him out of the house to hurt me while I was at work he refused to leave the porch. My ex then tried squirting him with a water bottle and when that didn’t work, he sprayed him with the hose. He basically got waterboarded and still would not leave.

He is my soul cat. When I got to the vet and they told me what happened I had one of the worst panic attacks I’ve had in awhile. I’ve had my cat for ten years and he has never gotten sick or injured. He has a UTI and a fractured foot from falling. The vet thinks he probably got his foot hurt first and that led to the UTI since he wasn’t using the litter box. I noticed he was slightly limping a few days ago but I couldn’t get him into the vet yet. The UTI developed quickly. I was naive in thinking the vet would save a pet's life even if the owner can’t pay upfront but it isn’t like a human going into the ER.

I’ve spent so much money and time trying to get away from my ex while also trying to live a normal safe life for my daughter. Once again something happens and he now knows the city we are in. I’m not running again because I can’t. I don’t think he will drive up here because like I said I’m a few states away but man did this bring back my paranoia and irrational fear.

I changed the chip information but the damage is done, I was a fucking idiot for not doing it sooner. This is my fault, I'm so damn tired.

***Relevant Comments:***

Commenter: Why did they use the microchip to get your number? Did your mom not have your most recent number to give them or something? Could you not be reached at work? That’s just weird to me.

>**OOP:** My mom was flustered because she knew the ER vet was going to be expensive and knew I couldn't pay but she couldn't answer any questions because she didn't know. Didn't know how old he was or if he had his shots. I can't take my phone into my work building and she didn't know the manager's phone number.  
>  
>I was able to pay partial with scratchpay but not all which is heartbreaking. A broken heart and frustrating anger is what I feel too.

Commenter: I just don’t understand why the vet would go through the trouble of scanning the chip and calling the numbers on there instead of just asking your mom for your number?? Seems like a lot of grief could have been avoided and the clinic had to do more work to call a company and get the phone numbers.

>**OOP:** I've had to change my number over 6 times in a three month time span, my mom didn't know it off the top of her head.

Commenter: If you are communicating with your mom it would be in her phone. If it changes so often, the last number in her phone would be more accurate than a microchip which is less likely to be updated. This is very strange.

>**OOP:** I was at work, I can not have my personal phone on me and my cat was having a medical emergency. My mom didn't know how old my cat is or if he had his shots. They had alot of questions she had no answer to so they scanned the chip to get information.

**Editor's note:** Some people commented on the first BORU that OOP's ex was a police officer. However, I can't find anything in OOP's posts or comments that confirms this, nor has she said anything about it. (Nothing shows up when checking deleted comments either.) It's definitely possible, but I just wanted to address it here since it was brought up so often."

# [ORIGINAL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfortLevelPod/comments/1hzdq48/aita_for_not_splitting_my_moms_inheritance_with/) posted on January 12th 2025

I (28F) have 6 siblings. Our mom recently passed in November from Stage 4 cancer. I had a really great relationship with my mom. We would spend time together and my 4 children (5 year old twins, a 3 year old, and a 1 year old) all loved her. I am the youngest of all my siblings. My older siblings didn’t prioritize much time with my mom until the last few months when she couldn’t do much for herself anymore.

I currently live with my boyfriend (38M) and our 4 children in a 3 bedroom apartment. It’s a nice apartment but of course is not ideal for our large family. Over the summer while my mom was still very coherent, she signed a transfer on death of her house (5 bedroom, 3 bath) to me for myself, my boyfriend, and our children to move into. She did the transfer so I wouldn’t have to buy the house as we would not be able to afford a loan for her house. And her house only had less than a year left until it was completely paid off so we would be able to afford her payments that way. All of my other siblings own their own homes and have plenty of room in their homes for their individual families. I didn’t ask my other siblings if they were okay with this but I didn’t see it as their decision or whether they had a say considering it’s our mom’s house and she had final say anyway. And like I said, all of my siblings own their own homes anyway.

Once my mom passed, she had some medical bills that needed taking care of so it seemed as though we would need to sell the house to take care of them. After looking into it more, my boyfriend said he would buy the house at just enough to cover the medical bills rather than what it’s worth considering we cannot afford what it’s worth plus my mom had planned on us just moving in and not doing any sort of loan anyway.

She had a cash inheritance which she left my oldest sister, Melanie(43F) to split equally among all of my siblings. Since my mom has passed, we have asked Melanie how much is left in the inheritance as it would be split 7 ways and she would always kind of dodge the question. She would say she hasn’t counted it yet or she’s unsure.

My mom also had some coins that were worth some money. She had 4 coins worth about $3,200 and a 5th coin worth about $1,200. I only found out about these coins from my other sister, Rochelle(35F) because she told me Melanie thought about giving the a coin worth $3,200 to herself, Rochelle, my brother Nick(37M), and myself. The coin worth less to another hand picked sibling. And then just never telling the last 2 siblings about the coins at all. That really upset me. I understand the coins gain value over time and that’s why they didn’t want to pawn them for cash to split equally but that is really unfair and considering there are not 7 coins, I believed the fairest situation would be to pawn them for cash so everyone could be involved. I suggested that and then never heard anything else about the coins after that. And then one day last week when I had Rochelle and my niece over for dinner, she dropped a gold coin out of her purse and quickly put it back. I never said anything but I couldn’t believe they decided to kick me out of that inheritance because I stuck up for the 3 siblings that were going to be slighted.

Well, flash to a couple days ago my boyfriend got approved for the loan. I told Melanie about this to keep her in the loop and her response shocked me. She told me she did not feel comfortable selling the house to my boyfriend. I didn’t understand because selling the house to my boyfriend was just a way for us to keep the house so that my moms medical bills would get paid. And my moms wishes were for my family to move into the house. After I got off the phone with Melanie, I called Rochelle to see how she felt but she couldn’t talk right away. Once I was able to talk to Rochelle, it was very clear Melanie had gotten to her first and manipulated the situation. So I texted the group chat with my siblings. Essentially, they all want to sell the house at full value to a stranger so they can receive an inheritance of cash from the house selling. Melanie had very obviously made them believe that my mom only transferred the house into my name so I could take care of selling it and splitting the money with all of my siblings. That wasn’t the truth and I tried telling them that our mom did not do that but Melanie had manipulated the situation. For context, Melanie is the oldest and all of our siblings can be pretty easily manipulated in a situation when it comes to Melanie. It sounds terrible but it’s true. I can see right through it and tried to say my side but they are all on Melanie’s side. They all want cash from the house but I want to live in it like my mom had intended.

Like I said, my mom transferred the house into my name. So I am going through with selling the house to my boyfriend to pay my mom’s medical bills and so us and our 4 children can live there. My siblings feel like I have scammed them out of an inheritance. But I feel like I found a way to get the medical bills paid so that my family can live there which is what my mom intended when she was here. So am I the asshole?

# [UPDATE 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfortLevelPod/comments/1i0ms5j/update_aita_for_not_splitting_my_moms_inheritance/) was posted on January 13th 2025

So first I want to say I am so appreciate of all the comments that seemingly are truly looking out for my best interest. My oldest sister, Melanie, had made me believe that the debt needed to be paid from the house not the cash estate (she would never disclose to us that there was enough to pay off my mom’s medical bills).

I contacted an estate attorney and ended up speaking with the attorney who was directly handling my mom’s medical debts. He told me that there was no need to sell the house right now. That my family could move into it with no worry of paying the medical debt until the future if I ever decided to sell it.

So that’s what we are going to do. If we ever decide to sell it (which I don’t see right now why we would as finding a 5 bedroom house is really hard to come by), we will split the sale of the house after her medical debts are paid and of course subtract any money we put into it going forward from their portion.

I do agree that keeping the deed of the house in my name is the wise decision so that I will always have that security with my children if something were to ever happen between myself and my partner. I really appreciate all of the comments making that aware to me and all of the comments wanting to make sure I seeked out a lawyer.

As far as the coins go, I didn’t mention them because I was upset I wasn’t getting a portion. I understand getting the house is a big deal. I mentioned what was happening with the coins to give an example as to why I don’t feel I can trust Melanie. And why I feel like she is not being honest about the money and the estate. Which she wasn’t. There is more money than just the coins that she is not being honest about. The deceptiveness is what hurts me. I feel like I am very open and honest with my family and would never try to deceive them. I would rather all conversations especially with my family hold integrity.

Once I had felt settled and secure with talking to the lawyer, I texted my sibling group chat to let them know what was going on. That the house will stay in my name. Melanie has been manipulating the situation and once she thought I was selling it to my boyfriend, I knew she would tell all my other siblings that the problem is not that I was keeping the house but that it would no longer be in my name. I can tell she is very angry that she can longer spin the story for her narrative. But this is what my mom had intended in the first place. For myself and my children to have somewhere to live and she always knew my boyfriend was in our package deal. Melanie still seems mad but I don’t see the problem anymore.

I’ll keep this post updated if anything else happens to come up. Again, thank you to everyone for the advice. It really helped me out so much and put me in a much more secure position.

I don’t have too much of an update currently however I don’t think I’ll have another update again until next week. And I want to keep you guys in the loop of what is going on. Since I have told Melanie that we plan on keeping the house, she has made it her mission (at least how I see it) to do everything in her power to bury me.

Melanie is my big sister by 15 years so I’ve always trusted what she’s said and done. Naively, I guess. Like I’ve said before, Melanie was my mom’s power of attorney. So she made sure my mom’s bills got paid toward the end as that was her responsibility. Once I told Melanie we would be keeping the house, she would tell me she didn’t have my moms account information and withheld all the information I needed to pay her bills. I made all the phone calls and all utilities were easily transferred into my name. However, going to the bank of course was a little more difficult. I can’t even make a payment without knowing her account number. Melanie has kept all of my moms paperwork and refuses to give me that information. So I am currently in the process of waiting for the bank to email me a form to fill out to become a person on her account that can make payments. Then once that hopefully gets accepted, I can apply for assumption of her account. I am hoping all of this goes over well with no bumps.

Melanie is very angry with me. I told her I didn’t feel like she was being fair in the way she was dividing the estate and that she continues to change the story to fit her narrative for that day or who she is talking to. I told all of my siblings they could go through my moms house still if they wanted anything of hers before we donate. Everybody has had a key to my moms house because we would all go over and help her with anything she needed. Melanie then went through the house to take all of the valuables, collectibles, anything that could be sold for decent money so she could sell it herself and pocket it all. Mind you, I’m not talking about a couple of small trinkets. She took 4 large glass/real wood curio cabinets, 20 collectible cookie jars, at least 100 collectible angels. And she did all of this in one day as soon as she found out I would be keeping the house. So I asked my boyfriend to change the locks. And he did. I’m so glad he did because I found out that they had been talking about taking the fridge and the stove!

Since then, my boyfriend believes that they have been coming over daily to check the trash. They are crazy. Once she found out the locks had been changed, she truly tried to isolate me from my siblings and my dad. They are really the only family I have left. Unfortunately, they are all very easily manipulated. Truthfully, I don’t really want to try to reconcile my relationship with them if they are so easily manipulated into cutting me out of their lives. And yes, she manipulated my dad as well. I lost my mom only a month and a half ago and now in the snap of a finger I’ve lost everyone else. It’s been very hard to deal with, but I truly don’t feel as though I’m in the wrong here. Maybe my post seems biased but I don’t feel like I am withholding any information.

I also contacted the lawyer who drew up the transfer on death so that I could make an appointment with her to finalize it now that my mom has passed. I also asked her if we could discuss my mom’s estate. She then told me that no estate had been filed. I also contacted the probate court in our county to get ahold of my mom’s will. And they also told me no will had been documented with them. All of that was Melanie’s responsibility. It isn’t right. I will definitely come back with an update end of January/beginning of February as I have an appointment with the lawyer to discuss this next week.

# [ORIGINAL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfortLevelPod/comments/1hzdq48/aita_for_not_splitting_my_moms_inheritance_with/) posted on January 12th 2025

I (28F) have 6 siblings. Our mom recently passed in November from Stage 4 cancer. I had a really great relationship with my mom. We would spend time together and my 4 children (5 year old twins, a 3 year old, and a 1 year old) all loved her. I am the youngest of all my siblings. My older siblings didn’t prioritize much time with my mom until the last few months when she couldn’t do much for herself anymore.

I currently live with my boyfriend (38M) and our 4 children in a 3 bedroom apartment. It’s a nice apartment but of course is not ideal for our large family. Over the summer while my mom was still very coherent, she signed a transfer on death of her house (5 bedroom, 3 bath) to me for myself, my boyfriend, and our children to move into. She did the transfer so I wouldn’t have to buy the house as we would not be able to afford a loan for her house. And her house only had less than a year left until it was completely paid off so we would be able to afford her payments that way. All of my other siblings own their own homes and have plenty of room in their homes for their individual families. I didn’t ask my other siblings if they were okay with this but I didn’t see it as their decision or whether they had a say considering it’s our mom’s house and she had final say anyway. And like I said, all of my siblings own their own homes anyway.

Once my mom passed, she had some medical bills that needed taking care of so it seemed as though we would need to sell the house to take care of them. After looking into it more, my boyfriend said he would buy the house at just enough to cover the medical bills rather than what it’s worth considering we cannot afford what it’s worth plus my mom had planned on us just moving in and not doing any sort of loan anyway.

She had a cash inheritance which she left my oldest sister, Melanie(43F) to split equally among all of my siblings. Since my mom has passed, we have asked Melanie how much is left in the inheritance as it would be split 7 ways and she would always kind of dodge the question. She would say she hasn’t counted it yet or she’s unsure.

My mom also had some coins that were worth some money. She had 4 coins worth about $3,200 and a 5th coin worth about $1,200. I only found out about these coins from my other sister, Rochelle(35F) because she told me Melanie thought about giving the a coin worth $3,200 to herself, Rochelle, my brother Nick(37M), and myself. The coin worth less to another hand picked sibling. And then just never telling the last 2 siblings about the coins at all. That really upset me. I understand the coins gain value over time and that’s why they didn’t want to pawn them for cash to split equally but that is really unfair and considering there are not 7 coins, I believed the fairest situation would be to pawn them for cash so everyone could be involved.

New Update 2 years later: I start job 5 on Monday. ~1.2 Mil a year. Here's my path and some thoughts on this crazy life.,"**I am NOT the Original Poster. That is** u/sweetmullet. He posted in r/overemployed.

There was a previous BORU with the first parts of the story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/xvikoz/i_start_job_5_on_monday_12_mil_a_year_heres_my/). **New Updates marked with \*\*\*\*\***

I also re-formatted the older parts due to how the sub has changed the last few years. I added a few of OOP's comments (not included in the original BORU) but OOP has probably close to 1000 spanning several years, so this is a very small sampling.

Thanks to my friend u/powerkickass for the rec!

# Do NOT comment on Original Posts. Latest updates have not been posted on this sub before. This is a VERY, VERY LONG and somewhat technical post.

**Mood Spoiler:** >!honestly idk but it's definitely an interesting look into someone's life!<

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/i_start_job_5_on_monday_12_mil_a_year_heres_my/)**: January 10, 2022**

I am in IT. I have a fairly niche title that everybody wants right now. I have 5 full time jobs, 4 of which are fortune 500 companies. If I manage all 5 for a year, I will make around 1.2 million in 2022. I made 16 dollars an hour in 2016. I'm still struggling grasping the sheer amount of money dumping into my bank account.

At the start of 2021 I got a new job. It paid around 70k (105k to \~170k) more than I was making at my previous job. I had the inside scoop from a previous coworker, so I was able to name drop and negotiate effectively. I was tempted to keep both jobs, since due to covid both were fully remote. My fiance is incredibly risk averse, so she talked me out of it. As I got situated in my new position, I became increasingly set on getting a second job. I played video games from 8-4, and sat in meetings barely paying attention. I've probably done around 15 hours of real work since I started in January of last year. In April I opened my resume to the world and by June I bagged job 2 (82 bucks an hour). Holy crap! Two jobs! I was giddy with the money, terrified of meetings overlapping, and horrified if they found out about each other. As I settled in to job 2, I found the meetings to be tedious. There were around 4 hours of meetings each day for job 2. I suffered through them, agreeing to job 3 (having never stopped interviewing. I just made my salary expectations higher and waited for something to fall in my lap). My thought process was that job 3 (90 an hour corp to corp) would likely replace job 2, as job 1 is a laughable cake walk. However, since I am now in the position of power, I decided to try to flex it a bit. I told my project manager that the meetings were a waste of my time. They got nothing done, and they didn't contribute to my work at all. I now participate in an average of 45 minutes of meetings each week for job 2. Job 3 is also a cake walk - around 1.5 hours a week of meetings, probably 5 hours a week worth of work.

I continue to field any job that will hear my salary expectations. I am now saying 95 an hour is my salary expectation. Another corp to corp gig comes around, and the hiring manager loves me. Once again being in the position of power, I am able to simply set my expectations with ZERO fear of the results - ""Given the scope of the work, my salary expectation is 105 an hour"". ""The highest we can go is 100."" ""Nope."" They gave me my request. They then tried to push back my start date a week. I told them ""I had already gave my two weeks at my previous job, so they will need to pay me for the absent week"". They hemmed and hawed, they tried to say no. I simply told them that I wouldn't work there then. They paid me 4200 dollars for a week that I didn't even sign in. I expected this job to fold quickly, as it's with a VERY prestigious company and there is quite a bit of spotlight on my role. It turns out that I haven't done fuck all since I started mid October. At 4200 dollars a week to go to a standup each morning to say I have nothing to do since \*October\*, job 4 is somehow an even bigger cake walk than job 1.

On Monday I start job 5. Initially having agreed to 115, I tried to press them for 127 an hour, but ended up at 120. This appears to be another job that I will just sort of expect to get fired from, but hopefully it turns into another easy 5k a week for doing jack shit.

Let's talk about things that I think are working for me:

1: Be fearless. After all, once you get job 2 your risk absolutely plummets. It is ingrained in you to be terrified of getting fired. That fear can fucking die when you move into your second role. The amount of relief of not having to worry about what your boss thinks of you, or how you accidentally overslept and that might piss off some clown in charge, it all fades. It's beyond freeing.

2: Be willing to be fired. I have the luxury of having job 1 be a cake walk with incredible benefits. So, from there, who gives a fuck about getting fired from job x? I try to keep job 1 happy (in the future probably not saying things like ""I am going to actively find a new job"" lol) and don't really give a shit about the others. I try to do the absolute bare minimum to keep all the jobs, since replacing one is a pain, but any fear of getting fired just isn't there.

3: Flex. Your. Power. Be willing to say ""I can't make that meeting"" or ""This meeting is a waste of my time."" People don't want to rock the boat. They don't want to do something that might be stupid. Use the fact that most people also want to do the bare minimum to get by. I have had zero pushback when I've asked meetings to be moved, or ""Hey, I can't make the standup today"".

4: Fuck having to defend yourself. Just say ""I can't make it"". I have gotten zero pushback on this.

5: Use your power position in not needing to listen about the job that is offering that paltry 65 an hour. Recruiters have a range. Demand the range. If it doesn't fit 10-15 bucks an hour more than your current job, tell them no. I EAGERLY accepted a role at 82 an hour 6 months ago. Christmas Eve I accepted a position for nearly 50% more than that. Flex. Your. Power. Job 2 takes the power out of your employers hands and plants it firmly in your own. Use it to climb, grow, and make your life what you want.

I have paid off all my debt already, bought a second house, will have enough money to completely revamp both houses by the end of February, and plan on snowbirding from Florida to WV for the foreseeable future at the ripe age of 35. Since this is all debt free, maybe I will cut down to 2 jobs? Maybe I will just dump money into retirement (starting your own S-Corp is fucking powerful guys. Talk to a CPA). Maybe I don't really give a fuck? Because the world, for the first time in my life, is MY fucking oyster.

I'm more than willing to answer any questions. Even though I have 4 active jobs right now I still play video games 4-5 hours a day. I have plenty of time. Hopefully this empowers someone to take the leap into this fucking *incredibly* positive lifestyle.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: I LOVE THIS! But I’m curious… do your jobs not ask for statuses on tasks? How do you get away without producing much?

>**OOP:** I think most people think the bare minimum is much higher than it actually is. There's a lot of sighing, a lot of ""ahh this roadblock"", a lot of ""I ran out of time this week"".  
There's been a ton of times that even I have been like ""There is no way they actually take this excuse"" and they always do.

Commenter: What tech stack you using?

>**OOP:** I'm hesitant to give any real details in this vein, but fuck it. I'm a site reliability engineer. I advocate for automating system tasks, along with working towards identifying issues that cause outages or issues that will eventually cause an outage. I mostly work within the Azure cloud, as it's easiest to hide behind the cloud when I'm ignorant on a topic. I'm honestly an absolutely trash engineer, and I fail any interview that really digs into technical knowledge.

Commenter: are you salary or contract?

>**OOP:** 1 Fulltime, 1 w-2 contract, 3 corp to corp contracts.  
(to another): None of them have non-compete. I don't think it applies, given the scope of work? I was sort of surprised that none of them had one.

Commenter: Corp to Corp is new to me, where can I find jobs like this? Also, what do you put on LinkedIn or job history in your resume while working for multiple companies?

>**OOP:** Most tech roles that are contracts will offer both W-2 or corp to corp. You just need to have your own corporation, insurance, etc. Costs about 1.5k to set up all in all.  
I keep job 1 as my job history. I don't mention any of the other jobs.

Commenter: Congrats on the money OP but there is a thin line we might not want to cross. You may think this is coming out of jealousy (sure, it is) but idk man, this sounds like “stealing”.

>**OOP:** I apologize if I get animated here, but it's something I am very passionate about.  
Every single corporation you have ever worked at doesn't care about you. They will ""steal"" your time for as little as they can possibly pay for it. They will ignore every good thing you do, and say you don't get your bonus because of that one time you forgot to fill out your timesheet. Corporations are designed to fuck over the people that work for them as much as they can, stopping just before those people stop coming to work. Fuck this mindset.  
I wouldn't advocate to do this to a mom and pop shop. I'm tempted here to list some of the companies I work for, but I won't because I think that WOULD be being Icarus. Suffice to say that I don't lose a fucking wink of sleep. They do it to people every single day and it's considered ""good business"". Fuck them.

Commenter: How much is your net deposit on pay day? Asking as a Junior dev to motivate tf out of me…

>**OOP:** 4800 a week pre tax, 4200 a week pre tax, 3600 a week pre tax, 4500 every 2 weeks after tax, 3250 every 2 weeks after tax and 401k max.

Commenter: That sounds great, but I am just wondering how do you handle the on-call. The possibility of being on-call simultaneously for 5 different jobs sounds like a nightmare.

>**OOP:** J1 has my on call 2 weeks every 13 months. I actually just got through my oncall and ignored all the calls because I didn't recognize the number. No issue from anyone on that front.  
J2 had me on call straight out of the gate, but I told them that it was unrealistic for me to be on call with the number of systems and familiarity you need to have (they have a VERY old, antiquated system). So I just am not on call at night anymore.  
J3 only needs to be up during business hours. So I am ""On call"" about 3 hours after I sign out for the day.  
J4 I was afraid of, but like I said above I have done literally (and I mean literally) nothing since mid October.  
J5 is more of an advocacy role I think. I will be surprised if I am an engineer that is on-call. I'm unsure about this one though.

**Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/comment/hx6du92/:) **February 16, 2024 (1 month later)**

I'm pretty slammed with 5 jobs. I was in meetings all day except for 30 minutes yesterday. The goal is to make a bunch of money. If I can make a bunch of money and not slave away for 8 hours a day that would be ideal.

Ahh, keeping j1. It is the easiest, and the one that would probably never fire me. However, Resume management is a huge part of this IMO. I don't want to have some weird amount of time where I am ""working two jobs"" according to my resume. The titles at both of the new potential jobs are also very good. I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

The excitement does fade. I'm pretty used to the amount of money flowing now, and honestly it still manages to feel slow. lol

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/u0j8bf/5_jobs_the_update/) **1: April 10, 2022 (3 months later)**

Hey everyone. I've had lots of people ask for an update and I got notified that it's my 10 year cake day today, so I'm feeling inspired to write up a summary of my last 4 months.

I still have all five jobs. I've gotten a promotion at one, a surprise extension at one, and berated for ""not delivering anything at all"" at one. When berated about a month ago, I simply yelled back that ""my job is hard"" and that ""poor communication from management has pulled me in many directions"" and I haven't heard anything about it since. I've stepped my game up slightly to hopefully eliminate these chats in the future.

I have had several large deliverables that have been pretty stressful - I tend to heavily procrastinate (which is honestly probably why I am good at managing multiple things - I inflict this on myself constantly. Lol) and that has led to some overwhelming moments. Thoughts like ""I should quit this job instead of deliver"" came to me pretty often, but that's pride talking. Fuck pride. Fire me please daddy. So I've been continuing the trudge, trying to not allow the absence of good work and the looming concept of being let go get the better of me. I have a plan, I'm sticking to it.

Job 5 turned into the biggest cake walk of all - I get paid about 20k a month for job 5, have a nice extension into August, and have done about 3 hours of work (probably about 8 hours including meetings) since I started. This one is not going to last forever, but my boss and I jive well, and I am serving the purpose they want me to serve, so everyone is happy.

I'm still playing 2-6 hours of video games every day, averaging about about 15 hours of work *\[editor's note- OOP clarified he meant per week, not day.\]* I've started playing video games through meetings and paying even less attention than normal. This is honestly probably pushing things too far, and I'll need to limit myself a bit better.

Once again, I will be aggressive about answering reasonable questions (to the guy that asked if I would be a reference for him, I appreciate you shooting your shot but jfc), give advice, or whatever. Please recognize that I am not some grand pooh bah of employment though. I am a trash employee who kind of lucked into a vein of IT that people don't know how to control yet.

***Some OOP's Comments:***

**OOP:** I go into this pretty heavily in the other post, but yeah, debt is eliminated, bought a second house, rehabbed the first house, rehabbing the second house, bought a model S. I am going to start heavily contributing to a pension for my company next. There's just so. much. money.

There have been a huge number of quality of life adjustments, my wedding is coming up and has been paid for completely in cash, I paid for 6 people to fly to it, helped my younger brother out with some cash, I tip like 100% at every restaurant we go to. I'm absolutely being more frivolous than I should if I was trying to be as efficient as possible, but it's fun as shit and I get to make other people have a good time too. Life is good.

>There was another dude in the previous post that was an SRE \[site reliability engineer\] and he just flat called me a liar because his job was so demanding. I think being an SRE is a place where you can chill, or inflict a ton of positive change if that's what you're into. I think the real secret sauce is knowing how to be a shitty employee without anyone really catching on, rather than being an SRE specifically.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/wl2mjt/part_3_its_not_all_butterflies_and_rainbows_an/) **2: August 10, 2022 (4 months later, 7 from OG post)**

**Title:** Part 3 - It's not all butterflies and rainbows - An Icarus Story

Hey all. It's been 8 months since my original post which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/i_start_job_5_on_monday_12_mil_a_year_heres_my/). My update post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/u0j8bf/5_jobs_the_update/), which was 4 months ago. *\[editor's note- OOP's math is off here, but that's probably because they started posting in January (1) and now are posting in August (8)\]*

To bring you, my beloved reader, up to speed here's a rundown. At the start of 2022 I had 5 jobs making an estimated 1.2Mil/Year (that estimate turned out to be bad. It was more like 960k). My update consisted of being wary about J2 being dissatisfied with me, J5 offering a dramatic contract extension, and the other jobs going mostly well.

There have been two main moments that I would like to share with the group, and both of them include being let go.

J2 I initially hated, due to their excessive meetings. As my beloved reader may recall, I pushed them aggressively about how those meetings were a waste, and they were significantly cut down. J2 was relaxed and I didn't do much at all. My leadership changed at about the 6 month mark, and immediately my new supervisor smelled the foul stench of a dogshit employee. At first I thought he was simply grumpy in general but it turned out he wasn't interested in continuing my contract. He scheduled a meeting about 3 months into being my boss, and explained that he was frustrated that I don't deliver anything. I yelled back that my job is hard, and didn't hear much from him over the next 3 weeks. With no real warning, the contract company I was working through emailed me and told me I was no longer an employee with them, pack your laptop, yada yada. While you could say his comment about me not delivering was a warning, there was no actual talk of ""You aren't delivering well enough, if you don't improve you will be let go"". If this was my only job I would be angry and poor.

J5. I truly miss job 5. My boss used me as a scalpel occasionally after I met my initial goals. We got along amazingly well. I barely worked. She knew I barely worked. I got the weird crazy shit done that she needed a consultant to handle that an employee might get in trouble for. Truly an amazing gig. She said my contract would extend into 2023. Insert frowny face here. The economic downturn led to the money drying up for all consultants at this company (of which there were many), and I got about 1 week of notice (in the middle of a 3 week vacation I was on) that my job would effectively not be available when I got back. My boss reached out, apologized for the abruptness of it all, and we said our farewells. If this was my only job I would be angry and poor.

This, to me, is why we do what we do. In once instance I got fired for being a shit employee that deserved to get fired. In the other my boss is exceedingly pleased with our working relationship but the company chose to protect profits over giving a shit what the impact was to the individual. In both cases the company chose to utilize a safety net to protect itself. It has the luxury of shedding employees in order to protect the plans or financials of itself as an institution. OE allows individuals to develop their own safety net. It provides a solid ""You fuck on me? I fuck on you"" relationship with these employers that truly don't care (due to the nature of capitalism, profit focusing, and corporate mindset). It levels the playing field considerably. For those of you reading that suffer from a deranged moral compass that wants to bootlick for these abhorrent corporations that don't give a single flying fuck about you, I want you to consider the above two lessons. Very different perspectives, same exact result.

As an overall life update, house 1 renovation is completely done (paid in cash), my Tesla has been purchased and received (paid in cash), I took a lavish vacation overseas and paid for 10 people to go (paid in points for travel, cash for the airbnbs), house renovation two is set to be paid for and will hopefully begin at the start of this year. In essence I have shrunk down about 10 years worth of goals to about 10 months. With the 3 current jobs I make just under 600k, and I start a new job 4 this week.

As always, I am pretty much willing to answer any question that doesn't DOX my ass. I am a huge advocate for this mechanism of changing your lifestyle and your lifegoal timelines and I hope to convince at least 1 more person to take the leap.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: how the heck can you take a 3 week vacation from 5 jobs all at once

>**OOP:** I had been fired from j2 already. The other 3 are contract spots, so I just don't get paid. J1 I took vacation days.

*The companies:*

>I have a LinkedIn that stops at current j1. I'm pretty sure someone from j5 saw my j1 still posted on LinkedIn and called HR saying they thought I was working multiple gigs. I explained the general concept of what I was doing sort of, giving them enough info to appease them but not enough to burn my lifestyle down. J1 HR was appeased, but it definitely made me rethink my current thought on LinkedIn. Mine is still active and listing j1 though.

***OOP's Comments on original BORU:***

Commenter: ""the company chose to protect profits over giving a shit what the impact was to the individual."" Really dude? Really?

>**OOP:** To be clear, this wasn't a ""the employer is bad because they did this"". The point I meant to convey is simply the reality of the situation. The company WILL protect itself, and employees are some of the easiest things to shed. I'm advocating for the value of not having all of your eggs in one basket, not the evils of corporations protecting themselves.

*OOP's accountant/CPA:*

>I said this in the other thread too - the CPA didn't even blink when I was describing the situation.

Commenter: Good for this person. That is a really sweet set up. It's still hard to not feel salty when I work 40+ hours a week as a teacher and am paid less than a tenth of what he earns in a year (at 600,000).

>**OOP:** I have a soft spot for teachers because of this. The people we SHOULD pay get absolutely fucked. I am paying one of my teacher friends 100k a year to learn how to do what I do, and hopefully take over a job or two in the near term. My other teacher friend wants to stick around, so I just buy everything for him when we are out and about.  
My heart goes out to you guys. You're super fucked right now. Hopefully it gets better. You are appreciated.

Commenter: I've seen some humblebrags in my life, but this takes the cake. I suspect you're going to write a book or become a financial personal trainer or some shit.

You don't even know the story of Icarus.

>**OOP:** I call myself Icarus because someone in the first thread called me that. Icarus is the boy who made wax wings (to escape jail I think?). He flew too close to the sun, focusing on having a blast flying, having too much confidence in his creation, and his wings melted. He plummeted to his death. My response to that nay-sayer was that I have many sets of wings because of this, but keeping the name is more of a troll of that one dude.  
I have no plans on leading people down silly paths and making money off of other peoples backs. I truly love pilfering money from large corporations. I'll stick to that, thanks. I have been tempted to write a book though. People have seemed to enjoy my straight forward approach and aggressive honesty about myself. I doubt I will follow through with it though.

# New Updates to this sub

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/10wgt3k/part_4_icarus_has_wings_that_melt_but_apparently/) **3: February 7, 2023 (6 months later, 13 from OG post)**

Hey guys, this is the fourth iteration of my path of OE. I started in about June of 2021 and have been updating semi frequently since January of 2022. A bunch of you have asked for more updates, so here we are.

For clarity, I will refer to all jobs by the number that they were received. As an example, J2 will be referred always as J2, though I am no longer employed there.

J1 - J1 still going great - Just got 50k dumped into my bank account as a bonus. Just got vested in all ways that I can get vested. The meetings are starting to increase due to team size and responsibility increases, but it would be pretty hard to beat the benefits/vacation/pay all in one, so I will probably keep it even if I have to drop down to 2 jobs. Idk. What the hell do I care? I'm a huge advocate for being dynamic, so we will see.

J2 - Fired. They figured out I sucked after about 10 months. I did, in fact, suck. Oh well.

J3 - Fired. The work load was pretty easy, but getting that work load done was misery. So. Many. Requests. I'm talking 7 individual requests to 6 different teams to get an alert created. Absolute ass. Sad that I sucked for my super cool boss, but that's really the only negative. Lasted for about 1 year.

J4 - J4 going strong and I hope it never goes away. I do absolutely fucking nothing. I have 4 30 minute meetings on my calendar. I go to 1.5 of them. I am ""on-call"", but I have been called a grand total of 3 times, and those wake up calls are literally the ONLY thing I have contributed. 245k so far to do damn nearly literally zero things. Hilarious. I fucking love J4.

J5 - As you may recall, I loved J5. My boss and I got along marvelously. Due to the economic downturn I had to say goodbye, but she called me and I'm back! Whoop whoop! Start date is in a few weeks. Hell yeah these wings are apparently unmelting back to wings as a plummet to the earth. Rad.

J6 - J6 sucked so bad. I was there for about 2 months. 120/h. They were just unsatisfyable. My go to is to impress the shit out of them up front and fade away into the ether. Well these guys just refused to be impressed. Whatever. They paid me 40k to be frustrated and annoyed for 2 months. Worth.

J7 - This job just started, and I was brought on as a large group to another company to facilitate some SRE focused changes. Good. Fucking. Lord. This team is a joke. A sham. A terror to all things ""agile"". Leadership is nonexistent, we have no access, access requests get denied, stories get deleted and are called ""confusing"" but that confusion isn't explained or corrected. I fully expect this job to just completely collapse. Who knows? Who cares.

That's the rundown. If you're keeping track, that's effectively 4 jobs currently. I was down to 2 for a few months. It was honestly kind of relaxing. I'm still trudging along, just raking in money. My financial advisor loves planning shit with me, as I am pretty open to whatever, I'm young, and I've got a fuckton of money coming in. Between my wife and I we made about 880k last year. On that note...

Holy fucking fuckkkkk taxes. Bruh. I'm about to send a god damn house worth of money to the IRS. My CPA is still working on it, but the fed is gonna get like 200k from my ass. Obviously worth, but holy cow. I think I paid like 23k in fed taxes for the 2020 year. Crazy shit. With the 2 w2 jobs and my wifes w2 job, we have a good amount in taxes paid already, but I'm still gonna write a 130k check or some nonsense. Brutal. As part of my life advice column, don't forget to save for taxes if you have your own corp. I was living the high life with 5 jobs. I could save up 200k in about 2 months if I needed to, but jobs don't stick around forever. Don't count on them. Just put it in a decent savings account and keep that shit.

Life in General

Life is pretty good. I have a solid retirement plan set up. My arbitrary figure right now is to retire at 55 with a yearly stipend of about 230k until death with a before/after taxes wombo. Houses are sitting pretty, with a much needed facelift to one, and the other will start in the summer. I hired a buddy to learn how to be an engineer since I've figured out how to set myself up and I like to help people. Dude is making 100k a year being a fucking rookie. Hilarious. I also get a nice tax reprieve from bringing him on as 1099, so that's nice. The hope is for him to kind of take over J7 if they ever get their own giant foot out of their own giant ass. Otherwise I don't have much to update. I haven't really learned anything new; my perspectives/recommendations are static from my first post. I think it's a good way to go about this whole OE thing. Chase that J4 man. Whoooo boy that job is fucking rad as hell.

As always, I will aggressively answer questions people have. Don't nag me though guys. Read through the comments of the first post before you ping me or I will ignore you.

***One of OOP's Comment:***

Commenter: How’s your physical health? Do you have time to get some exercises? Does your sleep schedule get impacted? Plan on having kids?

>**OOP:** Physical health is ok. I've been pretty shitty the last 5 years, but was incredibly active before that. Working towards losing the belly that has built up now. I've been super into fasting recently. It's working pretty well. Sports 2-3 times a week, trying to get at least 30 mins of walking in each day. It's a process.  
My sleep schedule is awesome. I wake up at 8:58 for my first meeting sometimes, about 3/4 times I just skip it and get the extra 30 mins of z's.  
Kids are no bueno. I have plenty of nieces and nephews that I can rain money down on and I like my time being mine.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/1f1rnzm/the_final_chapter_the_closure_of_oe_from_5_jobs/) **4: August 26, 2024 (1.5 years later, 1 year 8 months from OG post)**

**Title:** The final chapter - The closure of OE. From 5 jobs with an expectation of 1.2 mil a year to one job.

Hey everyone. Some of you may remember my original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/i\_start\_job\_5\_on\_monday\_12\_mil\_a\_year\_heres\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/i_start_job_5_on_monday_12_mil_a_year_heres_my/)

I still get requests to update, and given that my J4 project was officially announced as closing at the end of September, I figured today was a great day to write out my experience, what I did with my money, and some closing remarks to fully close out this wild ride.

This year, I have had two jobs. My original J1 is still my J1. I was promoted to principal and overall the amount of work I have to complete has significantly increased. While I don't care about companies at all and believe that pilfering as much money from them for as little work as possible is not only morally right but absolutely appropriate given they do the inverse to us every day, I do care very much about the individual people I interact with daily. There are multiple juniors on my team that require substantial effort, which I am very happy to help coach them and assist in their career growth and navigation. My teams' overall responsibility has also been much better defined and therefore it's been harder to hide in plain sight. I like the company, I like the work, and I like the team. I've never been proud of a place I've worked at before, and I believe that J1 has earned that pride and the trust I have placed on them by allowing it to become my sole job.

J2 (J4 from my original post) has gotten pretty gross. We were a team split in half by FTEs and contractors (10 in total). We got a new manager early in the year who simply has no appreciation for how terrible the on-call is. We were all sharing the primary/secondary responsibility, so I was on-call once every 2.5 months. That week is usually hell. You will get called on average 2.3 times a night. There were a few times where I worked for \~30 hours straight. Absolutely brutal. One of my fellow contractors left for a different team and the new manager made the rest of the contractors be solely responsible for on-call. So now I am on-call once a month, which is honestly so bad I thought about leaving just because of this, even though we basically don't do any other work. It simply wasn't sustainable keeping J1 happy while getting absolutely ass-blasted 7 days out of 28. Well, they have decided to end our contract at the end of September and expect the FTEs to now do that work. They are a good crew. I truly pity where their work life is headed.

I am still passively looking for a new j2, but honestly right now I feel a fairly immense amount of relief. Unless something falls in my lap I will be working the single job until the market recovers. Having to actually earn a job through solid interviewing is so annoying. lol. Below I will go over earnings, how I've benefited, where I fucked up, and where I succeeded. Hopefully it's interesting to you, or even something to learn from.

Rough gross earnings:

2022: 360k

2023: 730k

2024 (estimated year end): 450k

Net worth at the start: \~90k

Net worth current: \~1 million

**Purchases that improve my life on a long term basis:**

* Significant improvements to primary residence: 120k
* Hot tub: 15k
* Second home in the area of both of our families: 50k down. Rental income hasn't started on this yet, but something just fell in our lap for 6 months out of the year for 2k/month. This will pay for a majority of the financial impact this creates. 15 year/2.2% rate. We stay here \~2 months of the year.

**Significant improvements to primary residence: 120k**

* The top of the list has to be wine. I have spent too much money on wine. No real estimate here. <30k
* Model S Plaid. Writing a check for 100k for a car was... interesting, but I had wanted a Tesla for many years. I had no plans to buy the plaid, however they pushed back my delivery date by 3 months 3 separate times and had the plaid available immediately. What's another 45k?
* My wife has been a large benefactor of me raking in the dough. Roughly 30k total on jewelry, bags, etc.
* My wedding. We got married in Europe and paid for \~8 people to come that wouldn't have been able to afford it. We paid for lodging, a majority of food, and a majority of the wine. Amazingly, all of that totaled about 30k. I would do this again in a heartbeat. It was fun as fuck, cheaper than paying for only the venue/lodging in the states, and we got a Europe trip out of it.
* Paid for myself and my 4 brothers to go to a Bills game with great seats. My eldest brother has been a lifelong Bills fan and is a cheap piece of shit, so this was a great way to spend some time and spread the love. \~10k

**Where I fucked up financially:**

* In my efforts to get a financial planner I stumbled on a company. This company verbally told me they were a fiduciary, talked me into the ol' classic health insurance as a retirement vehicle scam, and it cost me about 50k. Now, in Mr. salesman's defense, I think if I continued making \~750k a year for 20 years this would actually be a good plan, and through my own idiocy and ego I figured that would be ezpz. After all, getting new jobs was easy as FUCK. Surely that would continue?
* The car goes here too. It's fun as fuck to drive. It's smooth, quiet, has all kinds of things I can set to improve my own personal experience, the self driving on the freeway is mostly incredible (boy have there been a couple scary moments though), etc. However, 150k on a car is pretty god damn \*\[Editor's note- TW, ableist language\]\*>!retarded.!<

**Things I have done to improve other peoples lives:**

* As noted before, I have a soft spot for teachers. I have paid for all meals (home or away) for my teacher friends when I am present. I have tried to elevate their ability to come out and have fun without worrying about the impact to their financial lives. As a past poor, I was very familiar with the reluctance to do something fun because of cost. Fuck that. Come have a good time. Don't thank me. Thank J4 and call me Robin Hood.
* A long time friend (and teacher) wanted to break into tech, so I hired him. He knew fuck-all about anything technology related, and I did my best to get his feet wet. The goal was for him to take over one of the jobs, but that never really panned out and I basically paid him to read/take certs/experiment. Paid him 50/hour fulltime for about 9 months. \~80k. He now has a tech job doing basic DBA shit for \~85k/year. Roughly double his previous salary, he works from home, etc etc etc. I'm super glad this plan panned out.
* While my mother in law was building a house, she stayed in house number 2 rent and utility free. This allowed her to get some of the ""wants"" for her house with the extra income without worry about rent.
* My youngest brother is having some serious problems with his ex wife and their shared son. I'm definitely throwing my weight around to bully his ex in order to either lose custody, inflict shared custody, or some other mechanism to help improve my nephew and my brothers' existence. I've paid for several lawyers, several PI efforts, etc. \~20k

That's it. That's the sum total of 3 years of being OE. It's mostly been fun. I've learned a ton, mostly about how to manage people and expectations. My favorite moments have definitely been being able to tell people that should be told to fuck off, to actually fuck off.

As always, I am pretty open to any questions.

J3 - \~90/H Large healthcare company. Boss wanted to hire me full time after about 6 months, but some personal stuff got in the way for him and he was MIA for about 4 months. When he came back, he wasn't impressed (I wouldn't be either). Contract killed after about 14 months.

J8 - \~95/H. Large shipping company. I told my manager that I didn't suggest an improvement to an implementation that I didn't fully understand yet and she just deleted my ass.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/i_start_job_5_on_monday_12_mil_a_year_heres_my/)**: January 10, 2022**

I am in IT. I have a fairly niche title that everybody wants right now. I have 5 full time jobs, 4 of which are fortune 500 companies. If I manage all 5 for a year, I will make around 1.2 million in 2022. I made 16 dollars an hour in 2016. I'm still struggling grasping the sheer amount of money dumping into my bank account.

At the start of 2021 I got a new job. It paid around 70k (105k to \~170k) more than I was making at my previous job. I had the inside scoop from a previous coworker, so I was able to name drop and negotiate effectively. I was tempted to keep both jobs, since due to covid both were fully remote. My fiance is incredibly risk averse, so she talked me out of it. As I got situated in my new position, I became increasingly set on getting a second job. I played video games from 8-4, and sat in meetings barely paying attention. I've probably done around 15 hours of real work since I started in January of last year. In April I opened my resume to the world and by June I bagged job 2 (82 bucks an hour). Holy crap! Two jobs! I was giddy with the money, terrified of meetings overlapping, and horrified if they found out about each other. As I settled in to job 2, I found the meetings to be tedious. There were around 4 hours of meetings each day for job 2. I suffered through them, agreeing to job 3 (having never stopped interviewing. I just made my salary expectations higher and waited for something to fall in my lap). My thought process was that job 3 (90 an hour corp to corp) would likely replace job 2, as job 1 is a laughable cake walk. However, since I am now in the position of power, I decided to try to flex it a bit. I told my project manager that the meetings were a waste of my time. They got nothing done, and they didn't contribute to my work at all. I now participate in an average of 45 minutes of meetings each week for job 2. Job 3 is also a cake walk - around 1.5 hours a week of meetings, probably 5 hours a week worth of work.

I continue to field any job that will hear my salary expectations. I am now saying 95 an hour is my salary expectation. Another corp to corp gig comes around, and the hiring manager loves me. Once again being in the position of power, I am able to simply set my expectations with ZERO fear of the results - ""Given the scope of the work, my salary expectation is 105 an hour"". ""The highest we can go is 100."" ""Nope."" They gave me my request. They then tried to push back my start date a week. I told them ""I had already gave my two weeks at my previous job, so they will need to pay me for the absent week"". They hemmed and hawed, they tried to say no. I simply told them that I wouldn't work there then. They paid me 4200 dollars for a week that I didn't even sign in. I expected this job to fold quickly, as it's with a VERY prestigious company and there is quite a bit of spotlight on my role. It turns out that I haven't done fuck all since I started mid October. At 4200 dollars a week to go to a standup each morning to say I have nothing to do since \*October\*, job 4 is somehow an even bigger cake walk than job 1.

On Monday I start job 5. Initially having agreed to 115, I tried to press them for 127 an hour, but ended up at 120. This appears to be another job that I will just sort of expect to get fired from, but hopefully it turns into another easy 5k a week for doing jack shit.

Let's talk about things that I think are working for me:

1: Be fearless. After all, once you get job 2 your risk absolutely plummets. It is ingrained in you to be terrified of getting fired. That fear can fucking die when you move into your second role. The amount of relief of not having to worry about what your boss thinks of you, or how you accidentally overslept and that might piss off some clown in charge, it all fades. It's beyond freeing.

2: Be willing to be fired. I have the luxury of having job 1 be a cake walk with incredible benefits. So, from there, who gives a fuck about getting fired from job x? I try to keep job 1 happy (in the future probably not saying things like ""I am going to actively find a new job"" lol) and don't really give a shit about the others. I try to do the absolute bare minimum to keep all the jobs, since replacing one is a pain, but any fear of getting fired just isn't there.

3: Flex. Your. Power. Be willing to say ""I can't make that meeting"" or ""This meeting is a waste of my time."" People don't want to rock the boat. They don't want to do something that might be stupid. Use the fact that most people also want to do the bare minimum to get by. I have had zero pushback when I've asked meetings to be moved, or ""Hey, I can't make the standup today"".

4: Fuck having to defend yourself. Just say ""I can't make it"". I have gotten zero pushback on this.

5: Use your power position in not needing to listen about the job that is offering that paltry 65 an hour. Recruiters have a range. Demand the range. If it doesn't fit 10-15 bucks an hour more than your current job, tell them no. I EAGERLY accepted a role at 82 an hour 6 months ago. Christmas Eve I accepted a position for nearly 50% more than that. Flex. Your. Power. Job 2 takes the power out of your employers hands and plants it firmly in your own. Use it to climb, grow, and make your life what you want.

I have paid off all my debt already, bought a second house, will have enough money to completely revamp both houses by the end of February, and plan on snowbirding from Florida to WV for the foreseeable future at the ripe age of 35. Since this is all debt free, maybe I will cut down to 2 jobs? Maybe I will just dump money into retirement (starting your own S-Corp is fucking powerful guys. Talk to a CPA). Maybe I don't really give a fuck? Because the world, for the first time in my life, is MY fucking oyster.

I'm more than willing to answer any questions. Even though I have 4 active jobs right now I still play video games 4-5 hours a day. I have plenty of time. Hopefully this empowers someone to take the leap into this fucking *incredibly* positive lifestyle.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: I LOVE THIS! But I’m curious… do your jobs not ask for statuses on tasks? How do you get away without producing much?

>**OOP:** I think most people think the bare minimum is much higher than it actually is. There's a lot of sighing, a lot of ""ahh this roadblock"", a lot of ""I ran out of time this week"".  
There's been a ton of times that even I have been like ""There is no way they actually take this excuse"" and they always do.

Commenter: What tech stack you using?

>**OOP:** I'm hesitant to give any real details in this vein, but fuck it. I'm a site reliability engineer. I advocate for automating system tasks, along with working towards identifying issues that cause outages or issues that will eventually cause an outage. I mostly work within the Azure cloud, as it's easiest to hide behind the cloud when I'm ignorant on a topic. I'm honestly an absolutely trash engineer, and I fail any interview that really digs into technical knowledge.

Commenter: are you salary or contract?

>**OOP:** 1 Fulltime, 1 w-2 contract, 3 corp to corp contracts.  
(to another): None of them have non-compete. I don't think it applies, given the scope of work? I was sort of surprised that none of them had one.

Commenter: Corp to Corp is new to me, where can I find jobs like this? Also, what do you put on LinkedIn or job history in your resume while working for multiple companies?

>**OOP:** Most tech roles that are contracts will offer both W-2 or corp to corp. You just need to have your own corporation, insurance, etc. Costs about 1.5k to set up all in all.  
I keep job 1 as my job history. I don't mention any of the other jobs.

Commenter: Congrats on the money OP but there is a thin line we might not want to cross. You may think this is coming out of jealousy (sure, it is) but idk man, this sounds like “stealing”.

>**OOP:** I apologize if I get animated here, but it's something I am very passionate about.  
Every single corporation you have ever worked at doesn't care about you. They will ""steal"" your time for as little as they can possibly pay for it. They will ignore every good thing you do, and say you don't get your bonus because of that one time you forgot to fill out your timesheet. Corporations are designed to fuck over the people that work for them as much as they can, stopping just before those people stop coming to work. Fuck this mindset.  
I wouldn't advocate to do this to a mom and pop shop. I'm tempted here to list some of the companies I work for, but I won't because I think that WOULD be being Icarus. Suffice to say that I don't lose a fucking wink of sleep. They do it to people every single day and it's considered ""good business"". Fuck them.

Commenter: How much is your net deposit on pay day? Asking as a Junior dev to motivate tf out of me…

>**OOP:** 4800 a week pre tax, 4200 a week pre tax, 3600 a week pre tax, 4500 every 2 weeks after tax, 3250 every 2 weeks after tax and 401k max.

Commenter: That sounds great, but I am just wondering how do you handle the on-call. The possibility of being on-call simultaneously for 5 different jobs sounds like a nightmare.

>**OOP:** J1 has my on call 2 weeks every 13 months. I actually just got through my oncall and ignored all the calls because I didn't recognize the number. No issue from anyone on that front.  
J2 had me on call straight out of the gate, but I told them that it was unrealistic for me to be on call with the number of systems and familiarity you need to have (they have a VERY old, antiquated system). So I just am not on call at night anymore.  
J3 only needs to be up during business hours. So I am ""On call"" about 3 hours after I sign out for the day.  
J4 I was afraid of, but like I said above I have done literally (and I mean literally) nothing since mid October.  
J5 is more of an advocacy role I think. I will be surprised if I am an engineer that is on-call. I'm unsure about this one though.

**Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/comment/hx6du92/:) **February 16, 2024 (1 month later)**

I'm pretty slammed with 5 jobs. I was in meetings all day except for 30 minutes yesterday. The goal is to make a bunch of money. If I can make a bunch of money and not slave away for 8 hours a day that would be ideal.

Ahh, keeping j1. It is the easiest, and the one that would probably never fire me. However, Resume management is a huge part of this IMO. I don't want to have some weird amount of time where I am ""working two jobs"" according to my resume. The titles at both of the new potential jobs are also very good. I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

The excitement does fade. I'm pretty used to the amount of money flowing now, and honestly it still manages to feel slow. lol

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/u0j8bf/5_jobs_the_update/) **1: April 10, 2022 (3 months later)**

Hey everyone. I've had lots of people ask for an update and I got notified that it's my 10 year cake day today, so I'm feeling inspired to write up a summary of my last 4 months.

I still have all five jobs. I've gotten a promotion at one, a surprise extension at one, and berated for ""not delivering anything at all"" at one. When berated about a month ago, I simply yelled back that ""my job is hard"" and that ""poor communication from management has pulled me in many directions"" and I haven't heard anything about it since. I've stepped my game up slightly to hopefully eliminate these chats in the future.

I have had several large deliverables that have been pretty stressful - I tend to heavily procrastinate (which is honestly probably why I am good at managing multiple things - I inflict this on myself constantly. Lol) and that has led to some overwhelming moments. Thoughts like ""I should quit this job instead of deliver"" came to me pretty often, but that's pride talking. Fuck pride. Fire me please daddy. So I've been continuing the trudge, trying to not allow the absence of good work and the looming concept of being let go get the better of me. I have a plan, I'm sticking to it.

Job 5 turned into the biggest cake walk of all - I get paid about 20k a month for job 5, have a nice extension into August, and have done about 3 hours of work (probably about 8 hours including meetings) since I started. This one is not going to last forever, but my boss and I jive well, and I am serving the purpose they want me to serve, so everyone is happy.

I'm still playing 2-6 hours of video games every day, averaging about about 15 hours of work *\[editor's note- OOP clarified he meant per week, not day.\]* I've started playing video games through meetings and paying even less attention than normal. This is honestly probably pushing things too far, and I'll need to limit myself a bit better.

Once again, I will be aggressive about answering reasonable questions (to the guy that asked if I would be a reference for him, I appreciate you shooting your shot but jfc), give advice, or whatever. Please recognize that I am not some grand pooh bah of employment though. I am a trash employee who kind of lucked into a vein of IT that people don't know how to control yet.

***Some OOP's Comments:***

**OOP:** I go into this pretty heavily in the other post, but yeah, debt is eliminated, bought a second house, rehabbed the first house, rehabbing the second house, bought a model S. I am going to start heavily contributing to a pension for my company next. There's just so. much. money.

There have been a huge number of quality of life adjustments, my wedding is coming up and has been paid for completely in cash, I paid for 6 people to fly to it, helped my younger brother out with some cash, I tip like 100% at every restaurant we go to. I'm absolutely being more frivolous than I should if I was trying to be as efficient as possible, but it's fun as shit and I get to make other people have a good time too. Life is good.

*OOP's Job:*

>There was another dude in the previous post that was an SRE \[site reliability engineer\] and he just flat called me a liar because his job was so demanding. I think being an SRE is a place where you can chill, or inflict a ton of positive change if that's what you're into. I think the real secret sauce is knowing how to be a shitty employee without anyone really catching on, rather than being an SRE specifically.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/wl2mjt/part_3_its_not_all_butterflies_and_rainbows_an/) **2: August 10, 2022 (4 months later, 7 from OG post)**

**Title:** Part 3 - It's not all butterflies and rainbows - An Icarus Story

Hey all. It's been 8 months since my original post which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/i_start_job_5_on_monday_12_mil_a_year_heres_my/). My update post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/u0j8bf/5_jobs_the_update/), which was 4 months ago. *\[editor's note- OOP's math is off here, but that's probably because they started posting in January (1) and now are posting in August (8)\]*

To bring you, my beloved reader, up to speed here's a rundown. At the start of 2022 I had 5 jobs making an estimated 1.2Mil/Year (that estimate turned out to be bad. It was more like 960k). My update consisted of being wary about J2 being dissatisfied with me, J5 offering a dramatic contract extension, and the other jobs going mostly well.

There have been two main moments that I would like to share with the group, and both of them include being let go.

J2 I initially hated, due to their excessive meetings. As my beloved reader may recall, I pushed them aggressively about how those meetings were a waste, and they were significantly cut down. J2 was relaxed and I didn't do much at all. My leadership changed at about the 6 month mark, and immediately my new supervisor smelled the foul stench of a dogshit employee. At first I thought he was simply grumpy in general but it turned out he wasn't interested in continuing my contract. He scheduled a meeting about 3 months into being my boss, and explained that he was frustrated that I don't deliver anything. I yelled back that my job is hard, and didn't hear much from him over the next 3 weeks. With no real warning, the contract company I was working through emailed me and told me I was no longer an employee with them, pack your laptop, yada yada. While you could say his comment about me not delivering was a warning, there was no actual talk of ""You aren't delivering well enough, if you don't improve you will be let go"". If this was my only job I would be angry and poor.

J5. I truly miss job 5. My boss used me as a scalpel occasionally after I met my initial goals. We got along amazingly well. I barely worked. She knew I barely worked. I got the weird crazy shit done that she needed a consultant to handle that an employee might get in trouble for. Truly an amazing gig. She said my contract would extend into 2023. Insert frowny face here. The economic downturn led to the money drying up for all consultants at this company (of which there were many), and I got about 1 week of notice (in the middle of a 3 week vacation I was on) that my job would effectively not be available when I got back. My boss reached out, apologized for the abruptness of it all, and we said our farewells. If this was my only job I would be angry and poor.

This, to me, is why we do what we do. In once instance I got fired for being a shit employee that deserved to get fired. In the other my boss is exceedingly pleased with our working relationship but the company chose to protect profits over giving a shit what the impact was to the individual. In both cases the company chose to utilize a safety net to protect itself. It has the luxury of shedding employees in order to protect the plans or financials of itself as an institution. OE allows individuals to develop their own safety net. It provides a solid ""You fuck on me? I fuck on you"" relationship with these employers that truly don't care (due to the nature of capitalism, profit focusing, and corporate mindset). It levels the playing field considerably. For those of you reading that suffer from a deranged moral compass that wants to bootlick for these abhorrent corporations that don't give a single flying fuck about you, I want you to consider the above two lessons. Very different perspectives, same exact result.

As an overall life update, house 1 renovation is completely done (paid in cash), my Tesla has been purchased and received (paid in cash), I took a lavish vacation overseas and paid for 10 people to go (paid in points for travel, cash for the airbnbs), house renovation two is set to be paid for and will hopefully begin at the start of this year. In essence I have shrunk down about 10 years worth of goals to about 10 months. With the 3 current jobs I make just under 600k, and I start a new job 4 this week.

As always, I am pretty much willing to answer any question that doesn't DOX my ass. I am a huge advocate for this mechanism of changing your lifestyle and your lifegoal timelines and I hope to convince at least 1 more person to take the leap.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: how the heck can you take a 3 week vacation from 5 jobs all at once

>**OOP:** I had been fired from j2 already. The other 3 are contract spots, so I just don't get paid. J1 I took vacation days.

*The companies:*

>I have a LinkedIn that stops at current j1. I'm pretty sure someone from j5 saw my j1 still posted on LinkedIn and called HR saying they thought I was working multiple gigs. I explained the general concept of what I was doing sort of, giving them enough info to appease them but not enough to burn my lifestyle down. J1 HR was appeased, but it definitely made me rethink my current thought on LinkedIn. Mine is still active and listing j1 though.

***OOP's Comments on original BORU:***

Commenter: ""the company chose to protect profits over giving a shit what the impact was to the individual."" Really dude? Really?

>**OOP:** To be clear, this wasn't a ""the employer is bad because they did this"". The point I meant to convey is simply the reality of the situation. The company WILL protect itself, and employees are some of the easiest things to shed. I'm advocating for the value of not having all of your eggs in one basket, not the evils of corporations protecting themselves.

*OOP's accountant/CPA:*

>I said this in the other thread too - the CPA didn't even blink when I was describing the situation.

Commenter: Good for this person. That is a really sweet set up. It's still hard to not feel salty when I work 40+ hours a week as a teacher and am paid less than a tenth of what he earns in a year (at 600,000).

>**OOP:** I have a soft spot for teachers because of this. The people we SHOULD pay get absolutely fucked. I am paying one of my teacher friends 100k a year to learn how to do what I do, and hopefully take over a job or two in the near term. My other teacher friend wants to stick around, so I just buy everything for him when we are out and about.  
My heart goes out to you guys. You're super fucked right now. Hopefully it gets better. You are appreciated.

Commenter: I've seen some humblebrags in my life, but this takes the cake. I suspect you're going to write a book or become a financial personal trainer or some shit.

You don't even know the story of Icarus.

>**OOP:** I call myself Icarus because someone in the first thread called me that. Icarus is the boy who made wax wings (to escape jail I think?). He flew too close to the sun, focusing on having a blast flying, having too much confidence in his creation, and his wings melted. He plummeted to his death. My response to that nay-sayer was that I have many sets of wings because of this, but keeping the name is more of a troll of that one dude.  
I have no plans on leading people down silly paths and making money off of other peoples backs. I truly love pilfering money from large corporations. I'll stick to that, thanks. I have been tempted to write a book though. People have seemed to enjoy my straight forward approach and aggressive honesty about myself. I doubt I will follow through with it though.

# New Updates to this sub

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/10wgt3k/part_4_icarus_has_wings_that_melt_but_apparently/) **3: February 7, 2023 (6 months later, 13 from OG post)**

Hey guys, this is the fourth iteration of my path of OE. I started in about June of 2021 and have been updating semi frequently since January of 2022. A bunch of you have asked for more updates, so here we are.

For clarity, I will refer to all jobs by the number that they were received. As an example, J2 will be referred always as J2, though I am no longer employed there.

J1 - J1 still going great - Just got 50k dumped into my bank account as a bonus. Just got vested in all ways that I can get vested. The meetings are starting to increase due to team size and responsibility increases, but it would be pretty hard to beat the benefits/vacation/pay all in one, so I will probably keep it even if I have to drop down to 2 jobs. Idk. What the hell do I care? I'm a huge advocate for being dynamic, so we will see.

J2 - Fired. They figured out I sucked after about 10 months. I did, in fact, suck. Oh well.

J3 - Fired. The work load was pretty easy, but getting that work load done was misery. So. Many. Requests. I'm talking 7 individual requests to 6 different teams to get an alert created. Absolute ass. Sad that I sucked for my super cool boss, but that's really the only negative. Lasted for about 1 year.

J4 - J4 going strong and I hope it never goes away. I do absolutely fucking nothing. I have 4 30 minute meetings on my calendar. I go to 1.5 of them. I am ""on-call"", but I have been called a grand total of 3 times, and those wake up calls are literally the ONLY thing I have contributed. 245k so far to do damn nearly literally zero things. Hilarious. I fucking love J4.

J5 - As you may recall, I loved J5. My boss and I got along marvelously. Due to the economic downturn I had to say goodbye, but she called me and I'm back! Whoop whoop! Start date is in a few weeks. Hell yeah these wings are apparently unmelting back to wings as a plummet to the earth. Rad.

J6 - J6 sucked so bad. I was there for about 2 months. 120/h. They were just unsatisfyable. My go to is to impress the shit out of them up front and fade away into the ether. Well these guys just refused to be impressed. Whatever. They paid me 40k to be frustrated and annoyed for 2 months. Worth.

J7 - This job just started, and I was brought on as a large group to another company to facilitate some SRE focused changes. Good. Fucking. Lord. This team is a joke. A sham. A terror to all things ""agile"". Leadership is nonexistent, we have no access, access requests get denied, stories get deleted and are called ""confusing"" but that confusion isn't explained or corrected. I fully expect this job to just completely collapse. Who knows? Who cares.

That's the rundown. If you're keeping track, that's effectively 4 jobs currently. I was down to 2 for a few months. It was honestly kind of relaxing. I'm still trudging along, just raking in money. My financial advisor loves planning shit with me, as I am pretty open to whatever, I'm young, and I've got a fuckton of money coming in. Between my wife and I we made about 880k last year. On that note...

Holy fucking fuckkkkk taxes. Bruh. I'm about to send a god damn house worth of money to the IRS. My CPA is still working on it, but the fed is gonna get like 200k from my ass. Obviously worth, but holy cow. I think I paid like 23k in fed taxes for the 2020 year. Crazy shit. With the 2 w2 jobs and my wifes w2 job, we have a good amount in taxes paid already, but I'm still gonna write a 130k check or some nonsense. Brutal. As part of my life advice column, don't forget to save for taxes if you have your own corp. I was living the high life with 5 jobs. I could save up 200k in about 2 months if I needed to, but jobs don't stick around forever. Don't count on them. Just put it in a decent savings account and keep that shit.

Life in General

Life is pretty good. I have a solid retirement plan set up. My arbitrary figure right now is to retire at 55 with a yearly stipend of about 230k until death with a before/after taxes wombo. Houses are sitting pretty, with a much needed facelift to one, and the other will start in the summer. I hired a buddy to learn how to be an engineer since I've figured out how to set myself up and I like to help people. Dude is making 100k a year being a fucking rookie. Hilarious. I also get a nice tax reprieve from bringing him on as 1099, so that's nice. The hope is for him to kind of take over J7 if they ever get their own giant foot out of their own giant ass. Otherwise I don't have much to update. I haven't really learned anything new; my perspectives/recommendations are static from my first post. I think it's a good way to go about this whole OE thing. Chase that J4 man. Whoooo boy that job is fucking rad as hell.

As always, I will aggressively answer questions people have. Don't nag me though guys. Read through the comments of the first post before you ping me or I will ignore you.

***One of OOP's Comment:***

Commenter: How’s your physical health? Do you have time to get some exercises? Does your sleep schedule get impacted? Plan on having kids?

>**OOP:** Physical health is ok. I've been pretty shitty the last 5 years, but was incredibly active before that. Working towards losing the belly that has built up now. I've been super into fasting recently. It's working pretty well. Sports 2-3 times a week, trying to get at least 30 mins of walking in each day. It's a process.  
My sleep schedule is awesome. I wake up at 8:58 for my first meeting sometimes, about 3/4 times I just skip it and get the extra 30 mins of z's.  
Kids are no bueno. I have plenty of nieces and nephews that I can rain money down on and I like my time being mine.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/1f1rnzm/the_final_chapter_the_closure_of_oe_from_5_jobs/) **4: August 26, 2024 (1.5 years later, 1 year 8 months from OG post)**

**Title:** The final chapter - The closure of OE. From 5 jobs with an expectation of 1.2 mil a year to one job.

Hey everyone. Some of you may remember my original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/i\_start\_job\_5\_on\_monday\_12\_mil\_a\_year\_heres\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/i_start_job_5_on_monday_12_mil_a_year_heres_my/)

I still get requests to update, and given that my J4 project was officially announced as closing at the end of September, I figured today was a great day to write out my experience, what I did with my money, and some closing remarks to fully close out this wild ride.

This year, I have had two jobs. My original J1 is still my J1. I was promoted to principal and overall the amount of work I have to complete has significantly increased. While I don't care about companies at all and believe that pilfering as much money from them for as little work as possible is not only morally right but absolutely appropriate given they do the inverse to us every day, I do care very much about the individual people I interact with daily. There are multiple juniors on my team that require substantial effort, which I am very happy to help coach them and assist in their career growth and navigation. My teams' overall responsibility has also been much better defined and therefore it's been harder to hide in plain sight. I like the company, I like the work, and I like the team. I've never been proud of a place I've worked at before, and I believe that J1 has earned that pride and the trust I have placed on them by allowing it to become my sole job.

J2 (J4 from my original post) has gotten pretty gross. We were a team split in half by FTEs and contractors (10 in total). We got a new manager early in the year who simply has no appreciation for how terrible the on-call is. We were all sharing the primary/secondary responsibility, so I was on-call once every 2.5 months. That week is usually hell. You will get called on average 2.3 times a night. There were a few times where I worked for \~30 hours straight. Absolutely brutal. One of my fellow contractors left for a different team and the new manager made the rest of the contractors be solely responsible for on-call. So now I am on-call once a month, which is honestly so bad I thought about leaving just because of this, even though we basically don't do any other work. It simply wasn't sustainable keeping J1 happy while getting absolutely ass-blasted 7 days out of 28. Well, they have decided to end our contract at the end of September and expect the FTEs to now do that work. They are a good crew. I truly pity where their work life is headed.

I am still passively looking for a new j2, but honestly right now I feel a fairly immense amount of relief. Unless something falls in my lap I will be working the single job until the market recovers. Having to actually earn a job through solid interviewing is so annoying. lol. Below I will go over earnings, how I've benefited, where I fucked up, and where I succeeded. Hopefully it's interesting to you, or even something to learn from.

Rough gross earnings:

2022: 360k

2023: 730k

2024 (estimated year end): 450k

Net worth at the start: \~90k

Net worth current: \~1 million

**Purchases that improve my life on a long term basis:**

* Significant improvements to primary residence: 120k
* Hot tub: 15k
* Second home in the area of both of our families: 50k down. Rental income hasn't started on this yet, but something just fell in our lap for 6 months out of the year for 2k/month. This will pay for a majority of the financial impact this creates. 15 year/2.2% rate. We stay here \~2 months of the year.

**Significant improvements to primary residence: 120k**

* The top of the list has to be wine. I have spent too much money on wine. No real estimate here. <30k
* Model S Plaid. Writing a check for 100k for a car was... interesting, but I had wanted a Tesla for many years. I had no plans to buy the plaid, however they pushed back my delivery date by 3 months 3 separate times and had the plaid available immediately. What's another 45k?
* My wife has been a large benefactor of me raking in the dough. Roughly 30k total on jewelry, bags, etc.
* My wedding. We got married in Europe and paid for \~8 people to come that wouldn't have been able to afford it. We paid for lodging, a majority of food, and a majority of the wine. Amazingly, all of that totaled about 30k. I would do this again in a heartbeat. It was fun as fuck, cheaper than paying for only the venue/lodging in the states, and we got a Europe trip out of it.
* Paid for myself and my 4 brothers to go to a Bills game with great seats. My eldest brother has been a lifelong Bills fan and is a cheap piece of shit, so this was a great way to spend some time and spread the love. \~10k

**Where I fucked up financially:**

* In my efforts to get a financial planner I stumbled on a company. This company verbally told me they were a fiduciary, talked me into the ol' classic health insurance as a retirement vehicle scam, and it cost me about 50k. Now, in Mr. salesman's defense, I think if I continued making \~750k a year for 20 years this would actually be a good plan, and through my own idiocy and ego I figured that would be ezpz. After all, getting new jobs was easy as FUCK. Surely that would continue?
* The car goes here too. It's fun as fuck to drive. It's smooth, quiet, has all kinds of things I can set to improve my own personal experience, the self driving on the freeway is mostly incredible (boy have there been a couple scary moments though), etc. However, 150k on a car is pretty god damn \*\[Editor's note- TW, ableist language\]\*>!retarded.!<

**Things I have done to improve other peoples lives:**

* As noted before, I have a soft spot for teachers. I have paid for all meals (home or away) for my teacher friends when I am present. I have tried to elevate their ability to come out and have fun without worrying about the impact to their financial lives. As a past poor, I was very familiar with the reluctance to do something fun because of cost. Fuck that. Come have a good time. Don't thank me. Thank J4 and call me Robin Hood.
* A long time friend (and teacher) wanted to break into tech, so I hired him. He knew fuck-all about anything technology related, and I did my best to get his feet wet. The goal was for him to take over one of the jobs, but that never really panned out and I basically paid him to read/take certs/experiment. Paid him 50/hour fulltime for about 9 months. \~80k. He now has a tech job doing basic DBA shit for \~85k/year. Roughly double his previous salary, he works from home, etc etc etc. I'm super glad this plan panned out.
* While my mother in law was building a house, she stayed in house number 2 rent and utility free. This allowed her to get some of the ""wants"" for her house with the extra income without worry about rent.
* My youngest brother is having some serious problems with his ex wife and their shared son. I'm definitely throwing my weight around to bully his ex in order to either lose custody, inflict shared custody, or some other mechanism to help improve my nephew and my brothers' existence. I've paid for several lawyers, several PI efforts, etc. \~20k

That's it. That's the sum total of 3 years of being OE. It's mostly been fun. I've learned a ton, mostly about how to manage people and expectations. My favorite moments have definitely been being able to tell people that should be told to fuck off, to actually fuck off.

As always, I am pretty open to any questions.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Other than real estate you didn't mention any additional portfolio investments. Throw some money into stocks?

>**OOP:** We've invested \~100k a year between 401k, 401k match, 457b, pension, and a brokerage.

*Breakdown of ALL the jobs:*

\[job one\] 180k base, my bonus this year will be 71k. That bonus should be consistent in the near future.

J2 - \~75/H Very shitty electric company in the north east. Deprecated system. Pretty tedious. Fired after almost a year.

J3 - \~90/H Large healthcare company. Boss wanted to hire me full time after about 6 months, but some personal stuff got in the way for him and he was MIA for about 4 months. When he came back, he wasn't impressed (I wouldn't be either). Contract killed after about 14 months.

J4 - \~105/H Premium contracting company. Contract dies at the end of Sept. \~3 years total. Somewhere around 610k pilfered.

J5 - \~120/H. The big fast food burger joint. They killed all temp contractors when the economy looked fishy. Got fired during my wedding trip. lmao. This one made me sad, as my boss and I jived super well and this was damn near a free 5k a week. Killed after \~6 months

J6 - \~110/H. Large financial company. They churned me and burned me. Was there to do a technical analysis of their SRE program. Completed. Was there for \~1 month.

J7 - \~120/H. Large financial company. I could NOT make these people happy. Did the same actions that made J5 love me and they were beyond disappointed. No idea what they were looking for, but it wasn't me. There for about \~2 months.

J8 - \~95/H. Large shipping company. I told my manager that I didn't suggest an improvement to an implementation that I didn't fully understand yet and she just deleted my ass. I guess she wanted me to be hyper aggressive about my opinion without fully understanding the system. There about \~3 weeks."
Is anyone else tired of the tariffs being blamed for everything?,"Does anyone else feel like the mainstream media/banks/politicians are ignoring the past 3 years of economic decline and using the tariffs as an excuse for all of our problems?

For instance, I watched the BoC speech last week where they declared that we had achieved a ""soft landing"" BUT, the tariffs are now putting that at risk. They haven't even finished dropping rates and the economy wasn't in a great place. It is way too early to declare a soft landing.

Similarly, CBC did an ""About This"" where they said the housing market was recovering BUT for the tariffs. They ignore that even the 2-month ""recovery"" (October and November) was still below seasonal averages and there were a lot of problems lurking in 2025 and 2026 (such as underwater condos and renewals at higher rates) that have nothing to do with the tariffs.

The tariffs (and threats) are putting gasoline on the fire, but the fire was already burning long before this happened.

Roaring Kitty & The Japanese Carry Trade,"**What is the Japanese Carry Trade?**

The **Japanese carry trade** is a financial strategy where investors borrow money at low interest rates in Japan (or other countries with similarly low rates) and use the borrowed funds to invest in assets or currencies offering higher returns elsewhere. It exploits the interest rate differential between countries. Here's how it works in detail:

# Key Features of the Japanese Carry Trade

1. **Low Japanese Interest Rates**: Japan has historically maintained ultra-low or even negative interest rates, making borrowing in yen inexpensive.
2. **Investment in Higher-Yield Assets**: The borrowed yen is converted into other currencies and invested in assets or markets with higher interest rates, such as U.S. Treasuries, emerging market bonds, or equities.
3. **Profit from Interest Rate Differentials**: The difference between the low borrowing costs in yen and the returns from investments in higher-yielding assets creates a profit margin for investors.
4. **Currency Risk**: Profits depend on currency movements. If the yen strengthens significantly, it could offset the returns from higher-yielding investments when converting back to yen.

**Example of the Carry Trade**

1. An investor borrows 1 million yen at a 0.5% annual interest rate.
2. Converts the yen to U.S. dollars and invests in U.S. Treasury bonds yielding 4% annually.
3. The net profit is approximately the 3.5% interest rate differential (ignoring fees and exchange rate changes).

**Risks of the Carry Trade**

1. **Exchange Rate Volatility**: If the yen strengthens significantly during the trade, the investor may lose money when converting back to yen.
2. **Central Bank Policy Shifts**: If Japan raises interest rates or other central banks lower theirs, the interest rate differential narrows, reducing profitability.
3. **Market Liquidity**: **During financial crises or periods of market stress, many investors unwind carry trades, causing sharp currency fluctuations and potential losses.**

The **Japanese carry trade is popular among institutional investors, such as hedge funds**, and has historically been a significant force in global financial markets. However, its success depends on stable economic and currency conditions.

The first time I even heard about this was back on June 7th, when Roaring Kitty aka DFV aka Keith Gill posted this as his Livestream cover:

[Roaring Kitty Livestream Cover \(June 7, 2024\)](https://preview.redd.it/1fca715xdlde1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e265cf52d2923e145504ad321f107afc2e1998d)

""I'll WAGER with YOU.

I'LL MAKE you a BET.""

These words come from 'The Babadook' book. [Here ](https://youtu.be/Rqqx32fiQkA?si=8r61jUix9F_dLix3&t=179)is a video narration of the book.

https://preview.redd.it/q88fprxkmnee1.png?width=1502&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8511cf36997d7f090b369662ee0a150e4241bb9

These are particular & strong words to express from RK. So what exactly is the bet? Let's break it down.

First, we have the Brian Windhorst meme.

https://preview.redd.it/ug3sntujilde1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea578ba2b3950f4396a02a550bce5ce9bb2a9ad4

Brian Windhorst , born January 29th, 1978. -S/o BF69

[Here ](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/brian-windhorst-meme-espn-nba-reporter-viral/v4s0r8zyyggcuzxcyx70sfmt)is an article breaking down the meme. However, I had ChatGPT break down the article for me. and here is that breakdown:

* On July 1, 2022, during an appearance on ESPN's ""First Take,"" NBA reporter Brian Windhorst analyzed the Utah Jazz's trade of Royce O'Neale to the Brooklyn Nets for a first-round pick. He described the move as ""very strange"" and suggested it might indicate forthcoming significant changes for the Jazz. [Sporting News](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/brian-windhorst-meme-espn-nba-reporter-viral/v4s0r8zyyggcuzxcyx70sfmt?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Windhorst's detailed monologue, accompanied by distinctive hand gestures, quickly became a meme, with viewers humorously mimicking his analytical style. His insights proved accurate when, shortly after, the Jazz traded star players Rudy Gobert to the Minnesota Timberwolves and Donovan Mitchell to the Cleveland Cavaliers. [Sporting News](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/brian-windhorst-meme-espn-nba-reporter-viral/v4s0r8zyyggcuzxcyx70sfmt?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* This sequence of events not only validated Windhorst's analysis but also cemented his status as a perceptive NBA insider. The meme continues to be popular, symbolizing deep-dive analysis and prescient commentary in sports journalism. [The Daily Dot](https://www.dailydot.com/memes/brian-windhorst-meme/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

So essentially, Brian Windhorst is symbolizing a Deep Fucking Value analysis with insights that will prove to be accurate. So, what is RK analyzing here?

On the left, we have two corresponding images from [This Scene](https://youtu.be/JopuDXR8crA?si=Zt_PL-efECEfE0Fk) from the Game of Thrones. First is the Green Candle about to be completely melted (which ends up blowing up the Citadel).

https://preview.redd.it/dkgusn391mde1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f4a73979525d436a4975cc52522feb70be9abae

The second is The High Sparrow's face with eyes of green fire. So, why does RK use the High Sparrow here? Theory:

* In ""Game of Thrones,"" the High Sparrow is the leader of a religious sect called the ""Sparrows,"" a group that rose to power during the War of the Five Kings, essentially acting as a radicalized faction of the Faith of the Seven; he becomes the new High Septon, wielding significant influence over the Iron Throne, particularly during King Tommen's reign, by using the Faith Militant (the military arm of the Faith) to enforce his strict religious interpretations and **punish the powerful, often targeting those perceived as corrupt or morally flawed.**

Okay, so now that we understand that RK is making a bet that something is coming closer and closer to blowing up ""The Citadel"" or the powers that be, what is that something? Let's theorize.

On the right, we have multiple images in one. Let's break them down. The first image at the top left corner is the ""[Wojak Monk](https://www.memeatlas.com/wojak-memes.html)"" meme.

[Wojak Monk](https://preview.redd.it/klb338pqnlde1.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a84110ebe58d4d6edcc57a0f08223e3b43bcb75)

* Wojak's character became associated with the phrases formerly used by Wojak such as ""I know that feel, bro"", ""that feel"" or ""that feeling when"". So what is Wojak supposed to be feeling here? A monk symbolizes a commitment to spiritual practice, poverty, and celibacy. Monks may also represent devotion, sacrifice, and service to others.

I can't place my finger on what this is supposed to represent, but I'll say it's something along the lines of a calm, zen master patiently watching all the ups and downs of the markets, news, and such to unfold, while maintaining hidden in the shadows.

Next, we see Adrian Veidt, also known as Ozymandias. This specific image comes from Watchmen Issue #11.

https://preview.redd.it/sarrkez7qlde1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62c760ebb1adc6da4716299c566c03116d654a83

The ""I did it 35 minutes ago"" moment in *Watchmen* \#11 is one of the most iconic scenes in comic book history, showcasing the genius and ruthlessness of Adrian Veidt, also known as Ozymandias. Here's a ChatGPT breakdown of the context and meaning behind it:

* **The Setup:** In this issue, Rorschach and Nite Owl (Dan Dreiberg) confront Ozymandias at his Antarctic base. By this point, the pair has pieced together that Veidt, a former costumed hero and the ""smartest man in the world,"" is behind a series of elaborate and deadly events. These include the framing of Dr. Manhattan and the murder of the Comedian. They believe they’ve arrived in time to stop his ultimate plan, which they expect to involve mass destruction or global upheaval.
* **The Reveal:** As they challenge him, Veidt calmly explains his rationale and unveils his plan in detail. He has orchestrated an elaborate hoax to prevent nuclear war by uniting the world against a common ""enemy."" This involves teleporting a genetically engineered, monstrous ""alien"" creature into New York City, where its sudden arrival will kill millions but convince humanity that they face an external threat. His goal is to avert global nuclear annihilation by fostering world peace through shared fear.
* **The Most Important Part:** As Rorschach and Nite Owl prepare to stop him, Veidt delivers the famous line: ***""Do you seriously think I'd explain my masterstroke if there remained the slightest chance of you affecting its outcome? I did it thirty-five minutes ago.""***

This, to me, states that whatever is going to happen to our beloved stock, $GME, the motion is already set in place and there's nothing anyone can do about it. So what exactly is set into motion? Let's keep diving.

Next, we see an image of Ryan Cohen as Dr. Manhattan.

https://preview.redd.it/0lttre9vslde1.png?width=326&format=png&auto=webp&s=99a5098b1894e18d02389e1c548bdcef0d263bec

Dr. Manhattan remains an enduring figure in Watchmen because he forces us to confront uncomfortable truths about power, responsibility, and the nature of existence. His ability to see the future but remain unable to change it challenges conventional notions of agency.

So is RK saying that Ryan Cohen has been able to see this future he is betting on? Did RC know that something would happen even before he took over GameStop? What future does RC see?

Another ape named DeepFckingBanana recently came across this old RK Post:

https://preview.redd.it/ewk6r7v9wnde1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9297c0ec661d8aed7a22ea8e8f7e88a654401b1

This clearly is a reference to how RC has seen what the GME Bears are up to, playing their stupid tricks, yet theyare no threat to him or his beloved companies.

Next, we see a beloved cat in the center of the Japanese Parliament Vote. Original Image:

[Japanese Parliament vote, December 8th, 2018](https://preview.redd.it/6k6bmdinwlde1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00ea7abe2c5066be76efb3f5d77574194abdd819)

* On December 8th, 2018, the Japanese Parliament voted on a hotly contested immigration reform bill that allowed foreign workers a path to Japanese citizenship. The plan was put forth by then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier that year and was opposed by Japan's opposition party, as well as some in Abe's right-wing base.
* When Yokoyama attempted to move to hold a vote on the controversial bill, he was beset by members of Parliament who apparently wanted to stop him from moving forward with a vote, leading to the image of Yokoyama speaking into his microphone while dozens of politicians attempted to restrain him.
* [Here ](https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/whats-going-on-in-this-picture-from-japanese-parliament-the-much-memed-attempt-to-restrain-shinichi-yokoyama-explained)is an article better describing the original image.

Lastly, we see the V for Vendetta finger about to flick a domino. [Here ](https://youtu.be/yde6t4WG5uY?si=zBMoc2PfybMByEDT&t=242)is the excerpt from the movie.

https://preview.redd.it/t3hnpahx0mde1.png?width=1903&format=png&auto=webp&s=57b9c9bc6fe8db79e9cd8c3c9bcc27b22618b750

Here's a ChatGPT Summary of the scene:

* V is seen arranging thousands of black and red dominoes in an intricate pattern. Once the arrangement is complete, he flicks one domino, triggering a chain reaction that causes all the dominoes to fall in perfect sequence.
* The moment he flicks the first domino signifies the initiation of his plan’s final phase and once the revolution is set in motion, it becomes an unstoppable force.
* Immediately after the dominoes fall, the scene transitions to real-world events unfolding as part of V’s plan, including mass protests and the regime’s internal collapse. This reinforces the idea that what V has set in motion is no longer under his direct control but is instead carried forward by the collective will of the people.
* This scene serves as a powerful visual and thematic metaphor, embodying the film’s central ideas of rebellion, freedom, and **the power of a single individual to ignite widespread change.**

**Let's wrap it all together** **now:**

Bringing this all back together.. In short, we have a major event from Japan, that RK is betting will set off a chain of events that will blow up ""The Citadel"" or the corrupt powers that be. What could this event be?

**The Japanese Yen Carry Trade.**

What significance have we seen lately with the Bank of Japan or the Japanese Carry Trade?

* On December, 25, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda stated The Bank of Japan expects the economy to move closer to sustainably achieving the central bank's 2% inflation target next year, Governor Ueda also said on Wednesday, suggesting **the timing of its next interest rate increase was nearing**. But he warned of the need to scrutinize the fallout from ""high uncertainties"" surrounding overseas economies, especially the economic policies of the incoming U.S. administration of Orange man. [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/japan/bojs-ueda-expects-further-progress-hitting-price-target-next-year-2024-12-25/)

This was announced on December 25th?

https://preview.redd.it/wbjogp4rcmde1.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=8072915f19b20ec7d98d4fad3f63cd5f3cc6bc03

What else was going on in Japan?

* Bank of Japan (BOJ) Issued a regional report Jan. 9. [Here ](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/brp/rer/rer250109.htm)is that report, which essentially states Japan's regional economies are on a path of moderate recovery, with specific challenges and strengths varying by area.

What else?

* Wide range of Japanese firms see need to hike wages, BOJ says, some firms already mulling how much they should hike pay, the new political administration uncertainty cloud outlook for export-reliant economy, & Findings to be factors BOJ will scrutinize at **Jan. 23-24 meeting** [Source](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/wide-range-japanese-firms-see-need-hike-wages-boj-says-2025-01-09/)
* The findings are among factors the BOJ will scrutinize at its next policy-setting meeting on Jan. 23-24, when the board will debate whether the economy is strengthening enough to justify **raising interest rates further.**

So the next major policy meeting will be on Jan. 23-24. I asked ChatGPT ""What would happen to the Japanese carry trade if Japan increased their interest rates?"":

If Japan were to increase interest rates, the dynamics of the Japanese carry trade would be significantly impacted. Here's what could happen:

1. **Reduced Appeal of the Carry Trade:** The core of the carry trade strategy is borrowing in a low-interest-rate environment (like Japan’s historically low rates) and investing in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. If Japan increased rates, the interest rate differential between Japan and other countries would shrink, making the carry trade less attractive. Investors would no longer be able to borrow cheaply in Japan and invest in higher-yielding foreign assets with as much margin for profit.
2. **Unwinding of the Carry Trade:** If Japanese rates rise, investors who are already engaged in the Carry Trade may begin to unwind their positions. This would mean repaying yen-denominated loans, leading to a rise in demand for the yen. This could lead to an appreciation of the Japanese yen as **investors close their positions and return borrowed funds.** Investors engaged in the Japanese carry trade would likely begin **unwinding their positions** due to rising borrowing costs in yen. This could lead to **selling pressure on assets funded by the trade**, including equities in developed and emerging markets. Stocks in sectors or regions that benefited most from carry trade inflows (such as high-yielding or emerging-market stocks) could see sharp declines.
3. **Global Financial Market Repercussions**: A rise in Japanese interest rates could lead to **global market volatility**. Emerging markets and other regions that have benefited from the flow of funds from the carry trade could experience a **capital outflow** as investors withdraw funds to pay off their yen-denominated loans. This could trigger depreciation of local currencies in emerging markets and other asset price adjustments, particularly in high-risk or high-yield assets.

Seems like if Japan increased their rates, it would effect the global economy at massive scale. Have we ever seen this happen before? Let's ask ChatGPT

""What happened the last time the Japanese Carry Trade had a major global impact?"":

The **Japanese carry trade** has had significant impacts on global markets during various periods, and the most notable events where it ""blew up"" or led to market disruptions occurred during times of financial crises or sharp shifts in monetary policy. Below are some key instances when the Japanese carry trade caused major market turmoil:

1. **The 2008 Global Financial Crisis**: The 2008 financial crisis is one of the most prominent instances where the carry trade, especially the yen carry trade, contributed to global market disruptions.The 2008 Global Financial CrisisThe 2008 financial crisis is one of the most prominent instances where the carry trade, especially the yen carry trade, contributed to global market disruptions.The 2008 Global Financial CrisisThe 2008 financial crisis is one of the most prominent instances where the carry trade, especially the yen carry trade, contributed to global market disruptions.The 2008 Global Financial CrisisThe 2008 financial crisis is one of the most prominent instances where the carry trade, especially the yen carry trade, contributed to global market disruptions.
   1. **Unwinding of the Carry Trade**: The onset of the financial crisis triggered a mass unwinding of the carry trade. Investors who had borrowed large sums of yen to fund their higher-yielding investments suddenly faced rising risk and liquidity concerns. They sold off the riskier assets they had bought (such as emerging-market bonds and equities) to repay their yen loans. This caused the yen to appreciate rapidly, as large amounts of yen were bought back to settle positions, putting additional pressure on the carry trade.
   2. **Market Impact:** The carry trade unwind added to the downward pressure on global stock markets, as the forced selling of assets triggered sharp declines in both equities and commodities. The yen strengthened significantly (reaching levels around 90–95 to the dollar from 120 in early 2008), which harmed Japanese exporters and led to further turbulence in the Nikkei 225 index.
2. **The 2015 ""Flash Crash"" in the Yen**: While not as severe as the 2008 crisis, the 2015 flash crash in the yen also highlighted how the carry trade could have a significant impact on global markets.
   1. **The Unwinding:** As risk appetite diminished following the SNB's unexpected move and as global uncertainty grew, investors started to unwind their carry trade positions. This led to a rapid appreciation of the yen as investors sold off their higher-yielding assets and bought back yen to cover their loans.
   2. **Market Impact:** The yen surged by over 3% against the dollar in just a few hours. Stock markets, particularly those in emerging markets and Europe, suffered significant losses as a result of forced liquidations and the appreciation of the yen.

**Conclusion:**

My conclusion here is that I think Roaring Kitty is betting that Japan will increase their rates and it will effect the economy, specifically hedge funds that have utilized the Japan Carry Trade. It seems to me that he knows this will cause an immediate Increase & tightening of the money needed to keep these loans/trades. It seems possible that if this happens, some over-leveraged companies may get margin called. This may be the domino kitty is waiting for to have all the rest of his plan unfold. No dates, but I have heavy eyes and a heavy heart patiently waiting to see what happens Jan 23rd & 24th.

Much Love.",2466,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1i3s2hy/roaring_kitty_the_japanese_carry_trade/,1737151505.0,Superstonk,"Roaring Kitty & The Japanese Carry Trade **What is the Japanese Carry Trade?**

The **Japanese carry trade** is a financial strategy where investors borrow money at low interest rates in Japan (or other countries with similarly low rates) and use the borrowed funds to invest in assets or currencies offering higher returns elsewhere. It exploits the interest rate differential between countries. Here's how it works in detail:

# Key Features of the Japanese Carry Trade

1. **Low Japanese Interest Rates**: Japan has historically maintained ultra-low or even negative interest rates, making borrowing in yen inexpensive.
2. **Investment in Higher-Yield Assets**: The borrowed yen is converted into other currencies and invested in assets or markets with higher interest rates, such as U.S. Treasuries, emerging market bonds, or equities.
3. **Profit from Interest Rate Differentials**: The difference between the low borrowing costs in yen and the returns from investments in higher-yielding assets creates a profit margin for investors.
4. **Currency Risk**: Profits depend on currency movements. If the yen strengthens significantly, it could offset the returns from higher-yielding investments when converting back to yen.

**Example of the Carry Trade**

1. An investor borrows 1 million yen at a 0.5% annual interest rate.
2. Converts the yen to U.S. dollars and invests in U.S. Treasury bonds yielding 4% annually.
3. The net profit is approximately the 3.5% interest rate differential (ignoring fees and exchange rate changes).

**Risks of the Carry Trade**

1. **Exchange Rate Volatility**: If the yen strengthens significantly during the trade, the investor may lose money when converting back to yen.
2. **Central Bank Policy Shifts**: If Japan raises interest rates or other central banks lower theirs, the interest rate differential narrows, reducing profitability.
3. **Market Liquidity**: **During financial crises or periods of market stress, many investors unwind carry trades, causing sharp currency fluctuations and potential losses.**

The **Japanese carry trade is popular among institutional investors, such as hedge funds**, and has historically been a significant force in global financial markets. However, its success depends on stable economic and currency conditions.

The first time I even heard about this was back on June 7th, when Roaring Kitty aka DFV aka Keith Gill posted this as his Livestream cover:

[Roaring Kitty Livestream Cover \(June 7, 2024\)](https://preview.redd.it/1fca715xdlde1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e265cf52d2923e145504ad321f107afc2e1998d)

""I'll WAGER with YOU.

I'LL MAKE you a BET.""

These words come from 'The Babadook' book. [Here ](https://youtu.be/Rqqx32fiQkA?si=8r61jUix9F_dLix3&t=179)is a video narration of the book.

https://preview.redd.it/q88fprxkmnee1.png?width=1502&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8511cf36997d7f090b369662ee0a150e4241bb9

These are particular & strong words to express from RK. So what exactly is the bet? Let's break it down.

First, we have the Brian Windhorst meme.

https://preview.redd.it/ug3sntujilde1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea578ba2b3950f4396a02a550bce5ce9bb2a9ad4

Brian Windhorst , born January 29th, 1978. -S/o BF69

[Here ](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/brian-windhorst-meme-espn-nba-reporter-viral/v4s0r8zyyggcuzxcyx70sfmt)is an article breaking down the meme. However, I had ChatGPT break down the article for me. and here is that breakdown:

* On July 1, 2022, during an appearance on ESPN's ""First Take,"" NBA reporter Brian Windhorst analyzed the Utah Jazz's trade of Royce O'Neale to the Brooklyn Nets for a first-round pick. He described the move as ""very strange"" and suggested it might indicate forthcoming significant changes for the Jazz. [Sporting News](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/brian-windhorst-meme-espn-nba-reporter-viral/v4s0r8zyyggcuzxcyx70sfmt?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Windhorst's detailed monologue, accompanied by distinctive hand gestures, quickly became a meme, with viewers humorously mimicking his analytical style. His insights proved accurate when, shortly after, the Jazz traded star players Rudy Gobert to the Minnesota Timberwolves and Donovan Mitchell to the Cleveland Cavaliers. [Sporting News](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/brian-windhorst-meme-espn-nba-reporter-viral/v4s0r8zyyggcuzxcyx70sfmt?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* This sequence of events not only validated Windhorst's analysis but also cemented his status as a perceptive NBA insider. The meme continues to be popular, symbolizing deep-dive analysis and prescient commentary in sports journalism. [The Daily Dot](https://www.dailydot.com/memes/brian-windhorst-meme/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

So essentially, Brian Windhorst is symbolizing a Deep Fucking Value analysis with insights that will prove to be accurate. So, what is RK analyzing here?

On the left, we have two corresponding images from [This Scene](https://youtu.be/JopuDXR8crA?si=Zt_PL-efECEfE0Fk) from the Game of Thrones. First is the Green Candle about to be completely melted (which ends up blowing up the Citadel).

https://preview.redd.it/dkgusn391mde1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f4a73979525d436a4975cc52522feb70be9abae

The second is The High Sparrow's face with eyes of green fire. So, why does RK use the High Sparrow here? Theory:

* In ""Game of Thrones,"" the High Sparrow is the leader of a religious sect called the ""Sparrows,"" a group that rose to power during the War of the Five Kings, essentially acting as a radicalized faction of the Faith of the Seven; he becomes the new High Septon, wielding significant influence over the Iron Throne, particularly during King Tommen's reign, by using the Faith Militant (the military arm of the Faith) to enforce his strict religious interpretations and **punish the powerful, often targeting those perceived as corrupt or morally flawed.**

Okay, so now that we understand that RK is making a bet that something is coming closer and closer to blowing up ""The Citadel"" or the powers that be, what is that something? Let's theorize.

On the right, we have multiple images in one. Let's break them down. The first image at the top left corner is the ""[Wojak Monk](https://www.memeatlas.com/wojak-memes.html)"" meme.

[Wojak Monk](https://preview.redd.it/klb338pqnlde1.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a84110ebe58d4d6edcc57a0f08223e3b43bcb75)

* Wojak's character became associated with the phrases formerly used by Wojak such as ""I know that feel, bro"", ""that feel"" or ""that feeling when"". So what is Wojak supposed to be feeling here? A monk symbolizes a commitment to spiritual practice, poverty, and celibacy. Monks may also represent devotion, sacrifice, and service to others.

I can't place my finger on what this is supposed to represent, but I'll say it's something along the lines of a calm, zen master patiently watching all the ups and downs of the markets, news, and such to unfold, while maintaining hidden in the shadows.

Next, we see Adrian Veidt, also known as Ozymandias. This specific image comes from Watchmen Issue #11.

https://preview.redd.it/sarrkez7qlde1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62c760ebb1adc6da4716299c566c03116d654a83

The ""I did it 35 minutes ago"" moment in *Watchmen* \#11 is one of the most iconic scenes in comic book history, showcasing the genius and ruthlessness of Adrian Veidt, also known as Ozymandias. Here's a ChatGPT breakdown of the context and meaning behind it:

* **The Setup:** In this issue, Rorschach and Nite Owl (Dan Dreiberg) confront Ozymandias at his Antarctic base. By this point, the pair has pieced together that Veidt, a former costumed hero and the ""smartest man in the world,"" is behind a series of elaborate and deadly events. These include the framing of Dr. Manhattan and the murder of the Comedian. They believe they’ve arrived in time to stop his ultimate plan, which they expect to involve mass destruction or global upheaval.
* **The Reveal:** As they challenge him, Veidt calmly explains his rationale and unveils his plan in detail. He has orchestrated an elaborate hoax to prevent nuclear war by uniting the world against a common ""enemy."" This involves teleporting a genetically engineered, monstrous ""alien"" creature into New York City, where its sudden arrival will kill millions but convince humanity that they face an external threat. His goal is to avert global nuclear annihilation by fostering world peace through shared fear.
* **The Most Important Part:** As Rorschach and Nite Owl prepare to stop him, Veidt delivers the famous line: ***""Do you seriously think I'd explain my masterstroke if there remained the slightest chance of you affecting its outcome? I did it thirty-five minutes ago.""***

This, to me, states that whatever is going to happen to our beloved stock, $GME, the motion is already set in place and there's nothing anyone can do about it. So what exactly is set into motion? Let's keep diving.

Next, we see an image of Ryan Cohen as Dr. Manhattan.

https://preview.redd.it/0lttre9vslde1.png?width=326&format=png&auto=webp&s=99a5098b1894e18d02389e1c548bdcef0d263bec

Dr. Manhattan remains an enduring figure in Watchmen because he forces us to confront uncomfortable truths about power, responsibility, and the nature of existence. His ability to see the future but remain unable to change it challenges conventional notions of agency.

So is RK saying that Ryan Cohen has been able to see this future he is betting on? Did RC know that something would happen even before he took over GameStop? What future does RC see?

Another ape named DeepFckingBanana recently came across this old RK Post:

https://preview.redd.it/ewk6r7v9wnde1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9297c0ec661d8aed7a22ea8e8f7e88a654401b1

This clearly is a reference to how RC has seen what the GME Bears are up to, playing their stupid tricks, yet theyare no threat to him or his beloved companies.

Next, we see a beloved cat in the center of the Japanese Parliament Vote. Original Image:

[Japanese Parliament vote, December 8th, 2018](https://preview.redd.it/6k6bmdinwlde1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00ea7abe2c5066be76efb3f5d77574194abdd819)

* On December 8th, 2018, the Japanese Parliament voted on a hotly contested immigration reform bill that allowed foreign workers a path to Japanese citizenship. The plan was put forth by then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier that year and was opposed by Japan's opposition party, as well as some in Abe's right-wing base.
* When Yokoyama attempted to move to hold a vote on the controversial bill, he was beset by members of Parliament who apparently wanted to stop him from moving forward with a vote, leading to the image of Yokoyama speaking into his microphone while dozens of politicians attempted to restrain him.
* [Here ](https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/whats-going-on-in-this-picture-from-japanese-parliament-the-much-memed-attempt-to-restrain-shinichi-yokoyama-explained)is an article better describing the original image.

Lastly, we see the V for Vendetta finger about to flick a domino. [Here ](https://youtu.be/yde6t4WG5uY?si=zBMoc2PfybMByEDT&t=242)is the excerpt from the movie.

https://preview.redd.it/t3hnpahx0mde1.png?width=1903&format=png&auto=webp&s=57b9c9bc6fe8db79e9cd8c3c9bcc27b22618b750

Here's a ChatGPT Summary of the scene:

* V is seen arranging thousands of black and red dominoes in an intricate pattern. Once the arrangement is complete, he flicks one domino, triggering a chain reaction that causes all the dominoes to fall in perfect sequence.
* The moment he flicks the first domino signifies the initiation of his plan’s final phase and once the revolution is set in motion, it becomes an unstoppable force.
* Immediately after the dominoes fall, the scene transitions to real-world events unfolding as part of V’s plan, including mass protests and the regime’s internal collapse. This reinforces the idea that what V has set in motion is no longer under his direct control but is instead carried forward by the collective will of the people.
* This scene serves as a powerful visual and thematic metaphor, embodying the film’s central ideas of rebellion, freedom, and **the power of a single individual to ignite widespread change.**

**Let's wrap it all together** **now:**

Bringing this all back together.. In short, we have a major event from Japan, that RK is betting will set off a chain of events that will blow up ""The Citadel"" or the corrupt powers that be. What could this event be?

**The Japanese Yen Carry Trade.**

What significance have we seen lately with the Bank of Japan or the Japanese Carry Trade?

* On December, 25, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda stated The Bank of Japan expects the economy to move closer to sustainably achieving the central bank's 2% inflation target next year, Governor Ueda also said on Wednesday, suggesting **the timing of its next interest rate increase was nearing**. But he warned of the need to scrutinize the fallout from ""high uncertainties"" surrounding overseas economies, especially the economic policies of the incoming U.S. administration of Orange man. [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/japan/bojs-ueda-expects-further-progress-hitting-price-target-next-year-2024-12-25/)

This was announced on December 25th?

https://preview.redd.it/wbjogp4rcmde1.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=8072915f19b20ec7d98d4fad3f63cd5f3cc6bc03

What else was going on in Japan?

* Bank of Japan (BOJ) Issued a regional report Jan. 9. [Here ](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/brp/rer/rer250109.htm)is that report, which essentially states Japan's regional economies are on a path of moderate recovery, with specific challenges and strengths varying by area.

What else?

* Wide range of Japanese firms see need to hike wages, BOJ says, some firms already mulling how much they should hike pay, the new political administration uncertainty cloud outlook for export-reliant economy, & Findings to be factors BOJ will scrutinize at **Jan. 23-24 meeting** [Source](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/wide-range-japanese-firms-see-need-hike-wages-boj-says-2025-01-09/)
* The findings are among factors the BOJ will scrutinize at its next policy-setting meeting on Jan. 23-24, when the board will debate whether the economy is strengthening enough to justify **raising interest rates further.**

So the next major policy meeting will be on Jan. 23-24. I asked ChatGPT ""What would happen to the Japanese carry trade if Japan increased their interest rates?"":

If Japan were to increase interest rates, the dynamics of the Japanese carry trade would be significantly impacted. Here's what could happen:

1. **Reduced Appeal of the Carry Trade:** The core of the carry trade strategy is borrowing in a low-interest-rate environment (like Japan’s historically low rates) and investing in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. If Japan increased rates, the interest rate differential between Japan and other countries would shrink, making the carry trade less attractive. Investors would no longer be able to borrow cheaply in Japan and invest in higher-yielding foreign assets with as much margin for profit.
2. **Unwinding of the Carry Trade:** If Japanese rates rise, investors who are already engaged in the Carry Trade may begin to unwind their positions. This would mean repaying yen-denominated loans, leading to a rise in demand for the yen. This could lead to an appreciation of the Japanese yen as **investors close their positions and return borrowed funds.** Investors engaged in the Japanese carry trade would likely begin **unwinding their positions** due to rising borrowing costs in yen. This could lead to **selling pressure on assets funded by the trade**, including equities in developed and emerging markets. Stocks in sectors or regions that benefited most from carry trade inflows (such as high-yielding or emerging-market stocks) could see sharp declines.
3. **Global Financial Market Repercussions**: A rise in Japanese interest rates could lead to **global market volatility**. Emerging markets and other regions that have benefited from the flow of funds from the carry trade could experience a **capital outflow** as investors withdraw funds to pay off their yen-denominated loans. This could trigger depreciation of local currencies in emerging markets and other asset price adjustments, particularly in high-risk or high-yield assets.

**Title:** What would you like to see in a downtown coffee shop?

Hi Ottawa! I am in the process of launching my coffee shop in the bank/slater area in about 6 weeks.

I wanted to hear what you might love to see in a downtown coffee shop that others might be lacking?

EDIT: Wow! Didn’t expect all these comments, but they’re very well received!

The key things we are going to work on…

1. Hours: we are going to figure out what a 7 AM to evening schedule could look like. We will work with supplier to figure out how to get inventory in at the early hours.
2. Art: Art forward space with locally created paintings (maybe a mural). Feel free to message me if you’re a local artist and want to display your work.
3. A solid $5 combo option that is something like filtered coffee + soup OR pastry.
4. Comfortable place to work or just relax. We need to dig around for the right furniture that is both comfortable but also easy to clean but this is a big priority.
5. Accessible food for the big dietary restrictions, especially GF, vegan, vegetarian

EDIT: I hope we can exceed the standards of the folks here. I will make another post in the coming weeks about where you can find us.

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

Commenter: Open past 5pm, PLEASE!

>**OOP:** I 100% agree. Currently aiming for 8 AM to 7 PM as the standard hours, and open weekend with hours TBD.  
Edit: looks like 7 AM should be the opening time. I don’t see why we couldn’t open an hour earlier and see how it goes.  
*To a different commenter:*   
Maybe a trial day once a week past 8 pm to see how it goes. I love late places so I understand what you mean.

Commenter: Couches, late hours, and a savoury breakfast sandwich. I'm so tired of candied bacon and syrup, just give me a NYC-style bacon-egg-n-cheese.

>**OOP:** I’ll have to see what we can do for that! Some of the best breakfast burritos i have are when I travel to SoCal, especially some of the food trucks with the best + affordable burritos ever!  
*To the same comment:*   
I love all of that. Comfortable seating is definitely harder to find. Some people just like to be quick so the stool style seating is good for them, but others want to be able to work in a couch or plushy chair setting for a few hours. Having both options is the ideal scenario!

*Comfortable but easy to clean...*

>Damn! There will be comfortable seating, but it has to work with that in mind. Going to dig around for furniture that can offer both.

Commenter: No blaring music. If there must be music, make it instrumental (no words). It is hard to concentrate otherwise.

>**OOP:** I have had so many coffee shop meetings with clients that I can’t hear! It drives me crazy. The music selection is a huge deal, something to think about for sure. Great advice

Commenter: If you offer food, vegan and vegetarian options and not just one of each. Remember, vegetarians can also eat vegan food, but vegans can't eat vegetarian food, and omnis can eat all of it. I have friends who have serious dairy allergies, so vegan options are their go-to so they don't get sick. \[...\]

Plugs for devices and comfy seating. Especially if you want to encourage workers to come in for their coffee meetings, which have started happening more now.

>**OOP:** What are you favourite vegan or vegetarian style food items at coffee shop? Or what would you love to see?  
I totally agree with the alternative milk options. This is all excellent advice!  
As for tech-related (wifi, devices, etc), I always nearly lose it when I can’t find good wifi or a plug at coffee shop LOL.

Commenter: Maybe no extra fees for non-dairy milk too? 🤞 A dollar extra for a splash of soy is criminal

>**OOP:** Agreed. Very silly to up charge for non dairy milk

*OOP expands:* 

>I spent a couple months in Europe last year. In Paris in particular, there were these beautiful and comfortable grand cafes that had couches, short tables, light instrumental music, just spectacular places where you could enjoy a few hours in comfort, working or doing nothing at all. While not easy to replicate that, I think we need more of those elements here.

*Workers:* 

>I am also looking for candidates to work as a barista at the shop. Morning + evening shifts are available.  
$19/hr + tips + health/dental (after 3 months)  
Starting around November

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/1fnv7yd/update_what_would_you_like_to_see_in_a_downtown/)**: September 23, 2024 (10 days later)**

Hey fellow Ottawans (& beyond),

As we gear up for the next part of our downtown coffee shop experiment, I carefully looked over almost every comment on my last post. Thank you so much for all the feedback! Many of you asked for more details, so here they are!

**Here are the facts.** We have many more things to share that we haven't finalized yet, but we do have enough for an update.

**1. We are calling it ""EveryPerson Café (EP Cafe) -** ***All Day, All Welcome."" Launching est. Nov 1, 2024.***

The downtown Ottawa community is strong and diverse, we came here as immigrants and got to see the magic of different backgrounds working together to create something special. It is also the centre of Ottawa's LGBT+ community, and they will always have a safe, inclusive, fun space with us. Additionally, we will be running long hours, hence the ""All Day"".

**2. The Coffee Shop will be located at 139 Bank Street (Bank & Slater).**

As a resident, you will have a very cozy, centrally located cafe. As a worker, you will be able to find a place to relax before work, during lunch, or after work.

**3. The food menu will be small at first. We are working with various local suppliers to create an inclusive menu.**

There will be 10-12 menu items available from the get-go. For sandwiches, our aim is to provide a vegan/vegetarian, GF, and regular option for breakfast + lunch. We will also have at-least one soup, and at-least 6 baked goods (which include at-least 3 of those baked goods matching GF and vegan. We are also working on a combo in the $5-$6 range for drip coffee + baked good OR soup.

**4. All pricing will be INCLUSIVE of taxes**

One of the things that drives me bonkers is that customers are expected to do the math. After traveling in Europe for several months last year and exploring the cafes/restaurants/everywhere, I don't see why we shouldn't have the same in our city.

**5. Vibes**

Think cozy, artsy, vintage, comfortable. Local artists creating murals, lots of comfy seating, lots of plugs, great wifi. We will stay open from morning into the evening, exact hours will be published soon.

Be careful with this. You're going to need big signage indicating that or people will think you are much more expensive than you intend. I agree that the inclusive system is better, but being the only one doing it may not work in your favour, especially when you advertise.

>**OOP:** I got a Nitro Cold Brew recently at Starbucks, and that cost $5.65 before tax… I am pretty sure we can beat the pre tax prices for some of these drinks!

Commenter: If you have any flexibility with opening hours, it would be great to have somewhere to go later in the evening! (Like 7 to 9 or 10.) \[...\]

>**OOP:** Thank you! We’re going to be pretty liberal with the closing times to start. We’re going to test late late into the evening and go from there.

Commenter: I haven't seen anyone mention this but hopefully your coffee shop will prioritize good coffee. It sounds obvious but good coffee makes all the difference. \[...\]

>**OOP:** We are most likely going with a well known roaster based in the local area. They are known for exceptional coffee, but this is something we will survey in the first few weeks for quality control.

Commenter: Serious question. Does this city really need another coffee shop? There are already so many of them. I'm not a coffee drinker thankfully, but even I notice them absolutely everywhere. 

>**OOP:** In the core, the distance of a coffee shop being 2 blocks further away than the closer one can make the decision for consumers, and we determined strong demand for our location.  
It’s also operationally improving as to what both workers want AND what downtown residents could use, and our strategy is to simply be open into the evening to serve both crowds.  
Lastly, what we tend to notice are tons of franchise and chain coffee shops. Yes, they are everywhere. But, they are also increasing prices like never before (not due to inflation, but maximizing profits), we believe we can be competitive in this area as well. I know we can beat pricing on a Starbucks nitro cold brew for example ($5.65+tax).

Happy Friday everyone!

After getting lots of messages on Reddit and social media wondering when we are finally going to open, we have some news.

Our opening day is scheduled for Sunday, December 1, 2024! At 139 Bank Street. We are hoping there are no roadblocks but will update everyone if anything comes up.

We have been working non stop for the past 75 days with the renovations team, food suppliers, and other partners to bring this idea to life.

I would love to hear from you here on this thread or via DM if you have an idea OR if you want to partner up as a host for your own event. Or just to let us know how you might use this cafe personally.

Community will be absolutely key in making this experiment a success.

For hours, we are planning to be open from 7 AM (potentially earlier) until 8 PM. We will be reviewing these hours in detail after we open to ensure it meets the needs of our staff and the community.

For coffee, we will be working with Brown Bag Coffee Roasters, through them, we follow our mission of supporting local. We are hopeful that this will be an excellent partnership.

Our espresso machine will be the gorgeous Victoria Arduino Eagle One. If you want a list of our espresso/coffee equipment, let me know in the comments and I’ll paste the links.

For food, we will be partnering with Olga’s Deli to supply fresh breakfast and lunch items. They are extremely hard working, have been around for decades serving the Ottawa region, and have given me nothing but wonderful service.

For pastries and other baked goods, we are still finalizing, but we have some great options on the table from Strawberry Blonde to Voila Bakeree

I will make one more post the day before we open just to give everyone a heads up. Your support and feedback will mean everything!

Thanks and please DM or comment any questions/concerns/feedback.

PS- We are STILL hiring more baristas. Please feel free to DM me or message us on IG to send your CV.

EDIT: Closer to Dec 13, but final date TBA

EDIT: Looks like we are going to open the week of December 9 to account for some shipping delays in final items! Won’t be long!

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

Commenter: As a non-coffee drinker, I would absolutely appreciate a good hot chocolate that is not sweet and just a bit bitter.

>**OOP:** Great idea. We will be introducing good drinks into the menu as we ramp up, but an excellent hot chocolate is especially on the list and we don’t want to get it wrong.

Commenter: I love that you're getting items from those gluten free bakeries. It would be wonderful if they could stay truly separate from any other baked goods so that people with celiac disease can have them (no cross contamination). Exciting!

>**OOP:** We’re working on cross contamination deterrence, and we do have some solutions like 2 display fridges with the separated types of items. The great thing is many of the delicious pastries from GF bakeries are also vegan so they hit a few of the marks making it more operationally efficient.

Commenter: Don't think staying open until 8pm in that part of downtown is viable honestly. Hoping he's busy through the night but worried he'll learn that the hard way and reduce his hours to 6pm or something

**OOP:** So here’s my rationale, and it’s all about value-add:

1. There aren’t many lounge cafes available in the evening in general. Meaning a place you can be comfortable, in a nice setting, either to do work, watch the snowfall, or be out with friends or a date, all without being forced to go to a pub (I love pubs but I also like options when I don’t want the pressures of alcohol).
2. Creating a space that people WANT to be at, rather than just being open for the sake of expecting evening guests. The vibe check is real and this is our vision: Cold February evening, the seasonal affective syndrome in full force, and you just need some summer nature in your life. The EP Café will be there and as you go inside, it will be as if you entered an oasis with plants on the walls and ceiling, + forest green themes throughout. All with great music that’s not too strong on the vocals so you can focus on your thoughts or conversation
3. We have different concepts for what the evening will look like. We brought jn an afternoon/evenjng manager that is also very well versed in making cocktail and mock tails menus, so having mocktail style options will quickly be part of the café.
4. Lots of community events. Ottawa wants things on the most ‘boring’ Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. And we’ve had no shortage of hosts who want to to partner with us to bring their existing events or new ideas to life. We’re taking community very seriously.

There’s more, but that’s the idea! I am confident that this will work and understand that there is a risk element here we’re willing to take on.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/1hhs2uq/final_update_what_would_you_like_to_see_in_a/) **3: December 19, 2024 (1 month later, 3.5 months from OG post)**

Hi everyone.

After LOTS of hurdles & unexpected (and very expensive) challenges, we are FINALLY launching our coffee shop tomorrow at 139 Bank Street: The EveryPerson Café (Or EP Café).

We have some spectacular murals on the wall created by our resident artist (He's been working diligently over the past 6 weeks to help us create a magical space).

**Some details:**

1. We are utilizing a Victoria Arduino Eagle One Coffee Machine - Absolutely spectacular machine that will be extremely competitive in the Ottawa area for those of you who look for premium quality in your espresso
2. We have public wifi & LOTS of plugs for remote workers, freelancers, and anyone who needs a fun change of scenery while browing.
3. We are open weekdays from 7 AM to 8 PM and weekends from 9 AM to 5 PM - We are confident that downtown residents have a need for an evening-friendly cafe, so let's put it to the test!
4. We are still adding additional items over the next couple of weeks as we ramp up so expect lots of pleasant changes, including more furniture, plants, and much much more.
5. We will have breakfast & lunch items available! There may also be samples featured through the afternoon tomorrow.
6. We are working with Olga's Deli & Strawberry Blonde Bakery as our primary suppliers for food.
7. We are working with Brown Bag Coffee Roasters as our primary supplier for coffee beans & materials.
8. Moving forward, there are lots of things we want to do over 2025, including becoming fully accessible (we haven't accomplished this yet due to the enormous cost and work required), offering specialty food items made especially in-house, offering an expanded vegan and allergy-friendly menu.
9. Not everything will be ready one day 1, but we will slowly ramp things up over the next few days as we open.

I would love to get continued feedback from you! If you'd like to help us with any community events, send a DM :)

***OOP's Comments:*** 

Hey! I am one of the owners at EP Café. I just want to thank you so much. The EP team called me right after you came and they were absolutely ecstatic.

The team has been working SO hard to help make this a reality and what you did, as our first customer was so absolutely generous. Especially during the holiday season

Thank you so much

EDIT: the customer was extremely kind, supportive, and left a generous first tip for the EP Staff. Our manager Val and barista Gavriel did an excellent job helping us open today.

*Why the opening was pushed back:*

>Yeah, totally messed up our opening date due to unexpected fixtures that ballooned time+costs so the opening date changed a few times (super frustrating!). But finally, we are open!

*OOP comments on a different post:* 

>Owner here - we’re still putting the rest of our items together including lounge areas and many more plants (we have them, but we’re planning the logistics for their locations) - there will certainly be comfortable places for customers to sit for a long while very soon.  
For the lighting, that’s great feedback and we will work on making the space brighter. Thank you so much for visiting.  
PS - if you show this message at the cafe the next time you visit, your coffee is on me.  
Happy holidays & Merry Christmas (if you celebrate) 🎅🏽

*OOP circles back on prices on the OG post:* 

Hey! We opened on Dec 19, and our drinks like cappuccino is currently under $4 and drip coffee at $1.99 :)

**Title:** Ottawa Business Journal: Thousands of Reddit comments help this Ottawa cafe owner open his downtown coffee shop

Article [link](https://obj.ca/thousands-reddit-comments-ottawa-owner-open-coffee-shop/)

***OOP's comment:*** 

It’s Dani from EP here. I don’t actually have any words to describe the appreciation I have for this community.

Seriously. I really didn’t know what would happen from that first thread, never expected it to get the response it did, and to watch it go all the way to this is mind blowing. THANK YOU. 🥲

The community came together, the team working behind the bar at the café has become the heart & soul, our community partners in art, food, and coffee have worked so hard to fulfill our (sometimes crazy) requests.

We are now growing quickly and even have our very first poetry night coming up this Wednesday Feb 5, hosted by the Carleton Poetics Society (you’re all invited!). We have an open mic coming as well. [you can follow events on our IG if you like (no pressure!)](https://www.instagram.com/epcafeottawa?igsh=MTRqdWNscWo0bm5xaQ%3D%3D&utm_source=qr)

We truly are powered by local, always will be.

I appreciate ya’ll so much.

If you find yourself in the cafe, please feel free to come say hi if you see me sitting behind my computer.

Lastly, you can show this message and grab a free drip coffee or tea.

*OOP responds to someone saying they got market research for free:* 

>Can totally see where that idea comes from but I hadn’t decided that a coffee shop would be the best thing to open when I posted that thread initially. I was basing it on my personal experience where I lived in centretown/downtown between 2018 and 2024 and wanted to see if community resonated with my feelings of what kind of space we might want in the area .  
Implementing the ideas in the comments was certainly not free and what others called crazy, but we did it anyways, because we sincerely believed that the community WOULD support.  
If we actually went with what market research told us, you would be seeing us close at 2:30 PM on weekdays and closed on weekends and have no bathroom LOL.",2143,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ijo5vf/reddit_helps_oop_start_their_own_coffee_shop/,1738907506.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,"Reddit helps OOP start their own coffee shop **I am NOT the Original Poster.

**Title:** What would you like to see in a downtown coffee shop?

Hi Ottawa! I am in the process of launching my coffee shop in the bank/slater area in about 6 weeks.

I wanted to hear what you might love to see in a downtown coffee shop that others might be lacking?

EDIT: Wow! Didn’t expect all these comments, but they’re very well received!

The key things we are going to work on…

1. Hours: we are going to figure out what a 7 AM to evening schedule could look like. We will work with supplier to figure out how to get inventory in at the early hours.
2. Art: Art forward space with locally created paintings (maybe a mural). Feel free to message me if you’re a local artist and want to display your work.
3. A solid $5 combo option that is something like filtered coffee + soup OR pastry.
4. Comfortable place to work or just relax. We need to dig around for the right furniture that is both comfortable but also easy to clean but this is a big priority.
5. Accessible food for the big dietary restrictions, especially GF, vegan, vegetarian

EDIT: I hope we can exceed the standards of the folks here. I will make another post in the coming weeks about where you can find us.

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

Commenter: Open past 5pm, PLEASE!

>**OOP:** I 100% agree. Currently aiming for 8 AM to 7 PM as the standard hours, and open weekend with hours TBD.  
Edit: looks like 7 AM should be the opening time. I don’t see why we couldn’t open an hour earlier and see how it goes.  
*To a different commenter:*   
Maybe a trial day once a week past 8 pm to see how it goes. I love late places so I understand what you mean.

Commenter: Couches, late hours, and a savoury breakfast sandwich. I'm so tired of candied bacon and syrup, just give me a NYC-style bacon-egg-n-cheese.

>**OOP:** I’ll have to see what we can do for that! Some of the best breakfast burritos i have are when I travel to SoCal, especially some of the food trucks with the best + affordable burritos ever!  
*To the same comment:*   
I love all of that. Comfortable seating is definitely harder to find. Some people just like to be quick so the stool style seating is good for them, but others want to be able to work in a couch or plushy chair setting for a few hours. Having both options is the ideal scenario!

*Comfortable but easy to clean...*

>Damn! There will be comfortable seating, but it has to work with that in mind. Going to dig around for furniture that can offer both.

Commenter: No blaring music. If there must be music, make it instrumental (no words). It is hard to concentrate otherwise.

>**OOP:** I have had so many coffee shop meetings with clients that I can’t hear! It drives me crazy. The music selection is a huge deal, something to think about for sure. Great advice

Commenter: If you offer food, vegan and vegetarian options and not just one of each. Remember, vegetarians can also eat vegan food, but vegans can't eat vegetarian food, and omnis can eat all of it. I have friends who have serious dairy allergies, so vegan options are their go-to so they don't get sick. \[...\]

Plugs for devices and comfy seating. Especially if you want to encourage workers to come in for their coffee meetings, which have started happening more now.

>**OOP:** What are you favourite vegan or vegetarian style food items at coffee shop? Or what would you love to see?  
I totally agree with the alternative milk options. This is all excellent advice!  
As for tech-related (wifi, devices, etc), I always nearly lose it when I can’t find good wifi or a plug at coffee shop LOL.

Commenter: Maybe no extra fees for non-dairy milk too? 🤞 A dollar extra for a splash of soy is criminal

>**OOP:** Agreed. Very silly to up charge for non dairy milk

*OOP expands:* 

>I spent a couple months in Europe last year. In Paris in particular, there were these beautiful and comfortable grand cafes that had couches, short tables, light instrumental music, just spectacular places where you could enjoy a few hours in comfort, working or doing nothing at all. While not easy to replicate that, I think we need more of those elements here.

*Workers:* 

>I am also looking for candidates to work as a barista at the shop. Morning + evening shifts are available.  
$19/hr + tips + health/dental (after 3 months)  
Starting around November

Hey fellow Ottawans (& beyond),

As we gear up for the next part of our downtown coffee shop experiment, I carefully looked over almost every comment on my last post. Thank you so much for all the feedback! Many of you asked for more details, so here they are!

**Here are the facts.** We have many more things to share that we haven't finalized yet, but we do have enough for an update.

**1. We are calling it ""EveryPerson Café (EP Cafe) -** ***All Day, All Welcome."" Launching est. Nov 1, 2024.***

The downtown Ottawa community is strong and diverse, we came here as immigrants and got to see the magic of different backgrounds working together to create something special. It is also the centre of Ottawa's LGBT+ community, and they will always have a safe, inclusive, fun space with us. Additionally, we will be running long hours, hence the ""All Day"".

**2. The Coffee Shop will be located at 139 Bank Street (Bank & Slater).**

As a resident, you will have a very cozy, centrally located cafe. As a worker, you will be able to find a place to relax before work, during lunch, or after work.

**3. The food menu will be small at first. We are working with various local suppliers to create an inclusive menu.**

There will be 10-12 menu items available from the get-go. For sandwiches, our aim is to provide a vegan/vegetarian, GF, and regular option for breakfast + lunch. We will also have at-least one soup, and at-least 6 baked goods (which include at-least 3 of those baked goods matching GF and vegan. We are also working on a combo in the $5-$6 range for drip coffee + baked good OR soup.

**4. All pricing will be INCLUSIVE of taxes**

One of the things that drives me bonkers is that customers are expected to do the math. After traveling in Europe for several months last year and exploring the cafes/restaurants/everywhere, I don't see why we shouldn't have the same in our city.

**5. Vibes**

Think cozy, artsy, vintage, comfortable. Local artists creating murals, lots of comfy seating, lots of plugs, great wifi. We will stay open from morning into the evening, exact hours will be published soon.

**Title:** Ottawa Business Journal: Thousands of Reddit comments help this Ottawa cafe owner open his downtown coffee shop

Article [link](https://obj.ca/thousands-reddit-comments-ottawa-owner-open-coffee-shop/)

***OOP's comment:*** 

It’s Dani from EP here. I don’t actually have any words to describe the appreciation I have for this community.

Seriously. I really didn’t know what would happen from that first thread, never expected it to get the response it did, and to watch it go all the way to this is mind blowing. THANK YOU. 🥲

The community came together, the team working behind the bar at the café has become the heart & soul, our community partners in art, food, and coffee have worked so hard to fulfill our (sometimes crazy) requests.

We are now growing quickly and even have our very first poetry night coming up this Wednesday Feb 5, hosted by the Carleton Poetics Society (you’re all invited!). We have an open mic coming as well. [you can follow events on our IG if you like (no pressure!)](https://www.instagram.com/epcafeottawa?igsh=MTRqdWNscWo0bm5xaQ%3D%3D&utm_source=qr)

We truly are powered by local, always will be.

I appreciate ya’ll so much.

If you find yourself in the cafe, please feel free to come say hi if you see me sitting behind my computer.

Lastly, you can show this message and grab a free drip coffee or tea.

*OOP responds to someone saying they got market research for free:* 

>Can totally see where that idea comes from but I hadn’t decided that a coffee shop would be the best thing to open when I posted that thread initially. I was basing it on my personal experience where I lived in centretown/downtown between 2018 and 2024 and wanted to see if community resonated with my feelings of what kind of space we might want in the area .  
Implementing the ideas in the comments was certainly not free and what others called crazy, but we did it anyways, because we sincerely believed that the community WOULD support.  
If we actually went with what market research told us, you would be seeing us close at 2:30 PM on weekdays and closed on weekends and have no bathroom LOL."

Part 1 https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1hxllrt/a_brief_history_of_gamestop_from_meme_to_moass/

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long-time lurker here. I've been composing a big write-up about GME for several years and I want to share the second part with you guys... Things are up for discussion, and I may have miscounted a settlement day somewhere, but most of it's rock solid IMO.

Feedback on improvement is very welcome, but I've google translated from another language, so don't fry me over petite grammatical flaws. When GME runs above sneeze levels, I'm going to Reddit and the press with the full story. So the more flaws/fallacies you can spot the better. Crosspost to SS welcome (not enough k@rma).

Towards the end of this wall of text is a very detailed, possible timeline of all the FTD cycles since april 2024 - ending with the beginning of MOASS in January 2025.

# April 2024 - Run Lola Run

Between 24-26th of April 2024, when GME was around $10, blocks of unusually large calls (potential future purchase orders) were opened at $20. Calls pressure market makers to hedge (cover by buying shares), which underpins a high share price for a period. The reason is that the market maker must have enough shares in stock if many calls are traded. However, calls have a fee and an expiration date - and if the share price is too low when the time has passed, they become worthless.

On May 9 (after over 3 years of hibernation), Keith Gill suddenly liked a tweet of the famous scene in the film  
Run Lola Run, where the protagonist bet on the roulette number ""20"" - and won. Then, on May 12, Gill sent a meme - now it got serious. D. May 13, in the pre-market (before market opening hours), GME exploded to 80 dollars (equivalent to 320 before the 1:4 split). As private investors do not normally have access to the pre-market, they could not have driven the price movement - was it Gill's doing?  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cs5j2j/for\_those\_outside\_reddit\_how\_retail\_is\_moving/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cs5j2j/for_those_outside_reddit_how_retail_is_moving/)

From 12-17th of May, Gill posted a total of 110 amusing, cryptic memes - they would prove important:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkuQL4wjLLQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkuQL4wjLLQ)

At the same time, approx. 90% of trades ran through the far less regulated OTC market, which retail investors don't normally have access to either, and GME quickly fell to a steady $20:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ctg3y7/99\_of\_trades\_take\_place\_in\_the\_otc\_market\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ctg3y7/99_of_trades_take_place_in_the_otc_market_the/)

In mid-May, huge calls for over 12 million shares opened at $20 - again just like the bet in Run Lola Run. Then, on May 17, GameStop sold 45 million new shares on the market and doubled the savings to $2 billion. It was similar to the same move Cohen had made in April and June 2021 - as GME surged, GameStop sold $1.5 billion worth of new stock. However, the DRS movement was critical of the dilution of GME because the DRS figure fell as savings increased.

On June 2, Gill revealed that he holds 5 million shares and calls for 12 million shares - the cat was out of the bag:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d6wy8d/sharing\_data\_the\_days\_dfv\_added\_an\_important/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d6wy8d/sharing_data_the_days_dfv_added_an_important/)

It was later counted that Gill had bought calls for 14 million shares, so where were the rest? ~~The answer had to be found at GameStop. On May 13, when GME hit 80 dollars, GameStop bought back 2 million shares. Gill was probably testing the market's (algorithms') response to him trading a big call, and GameStop was just making a natural counter move to the sudden, aggressive acquisition of GME:~~  
(Open for technical discussion. Possibly just Gill, and not also GameStop, purchasing 2 million shares):  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cr75i8/comment/l3w2e47/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cr75i8/comment/l3w2e47/)

But how did Gill time his return? Probably by analyzing calls. It makes sense for short sellers to buy calls (potential shares) if they want the balance sheet to look balanced. LEAPS are a type of calls that can run for up to 39 months. Exactly 39 months before May 2024 was February 2021 when GME was shorted down to $10… In March 2021 GME was pushed down again - these LEAPS' expiration date would be June 2024. If the theory was correct, his calls maintained such a high share price, that short sellers couldn't buy new cheap LEAPS when the old ones expired:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cs5rkk/leaps\_i\_think\_i\_stumbled\_on\_something\_need\_brains/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cs5rkk/leaps_i_think_i_stumbled_on_something_need_brains/)

At the same time, it turned out that swaps for 2 billion dollars had expired in 2024. Short sellers must have had a hard time hiding the phantom shares:  
[https://youtu.be/X-\_Pnzkv810?si=yAAx72lNPp9K4VpI&t=1292](https://youtu.be/X-_Pnzkv810?si=yAAx72lNPp9K4VpI&t=1292)

Back in January 2021, most retail investors had arguably taken $250 (1,000 before the 1:4 split). Now, years of extreme price swings, educating discussions on Reddit forums, and outrage over a blatantly corrupt system that called private investors ""dumb money"" had left hundreds of thousands with ""diamond hands"" - they wouldn't sell until GME hit thousands (or million) of dollars under MOASS. Now you would see bankruptcies, domino collapses and prison time at the corrupt hedge funds, brokers, banks, market makers and clearing houses. Afterwards, a fair market could be built.

# The tide goes out - The algorithms are revealed

On June 5, CNBC host Jim Cramer interviewed SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Cramer accused Gill of market manipulation, but Gensler ruled that everyone is free to talk about and buy stocks: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d8qid7/gary\_gensler\_vs\_jim\_cramer\_about\_dfv\_no\_lie\_or/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d8qid7/gary_gensler_vs_jim_cramer_about_dfv_no_lie_or/)

The accusation was particularly ironic, since Cramer himself had told in detail how his hedge fund manipulated the market in 2006. Moreover, his job at CNBC for two decades was to promote the buying and selling of certain stocks - for example, he recommended the stock of the bank Bear Stearns days before the 2008 crash…  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d8tcfm/jim\_cramer\_on\_how\_he\_manipulated](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d8tcfm/jim_cramer_on_how_he_manipulated)

According to the financial media The Wall Street Journal, the broker E-Trade (an old acquaintance from 2021) talked about throwing Gill off their platform, which was denied. Had E-trade simply delivered IOUs?  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d88qd5/i\_think\_its\_clear\_why\_rk\_is\_getting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d88qd5/i_think_its_clear_why_rk_is_getting)

At the same time, data revealed that the market maker who had sold calls to Gill had taken the fee without hedging a single stock:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d8qtaa/they\_never\_hedged/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d8qtaa/they_never_hedged/)

It soon turned out that this market maker was Wolverine - another old familiar from 2021:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dd7je1/strong\_indication\_that\_wolverine\_trading\_is\_naked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dd7je1/strong_indication_that_wolverine_trading_is_naked/)

The corrupt links in the trade chain had lined up the pieces for their own domino collapse, and Gill seemed to know when it would begin. As the investor Warren Buffett once so poetically said: ""Only when the tide goes out do you learn who has been swimming naked.""

On June 6th, what no one had dared to hope for happened - Gill announced a new live stream. Thousands of investors poured in and GME rose to $65. Everyone was restlessly waiting for June 7. It would be the 5th anniversary of Gill's very first purchase of GME - and oddly enough the 25th anniversary of Run Lola Run.

On June 7, GameStop sold an additional 75 million new shares on the market - the savings doubled again and were now well over $4 billion. With 426 million shares in play on the market, GME had been diluted by 40% in a few weeks, but the savings had quadrupled - a sensible barter for the company. The critical voices grew over the dilution, but the insiders' investments had also been diluted. In addition, insiders had primarily sold shares for tax reasons for years. Cohen and the board were personally invested in a long-term strategy, and they clearly knew how to do it.

By the evening of June 7, over 600,000 people were tuning in to Gill's channel, and millions of viewers were watching the live stream on CNBC. Gill enjoyed himself with people on the chat, showed his long position and told E-Trade: ""I see those headlines... Don't make me remove it."" Afterwards, Gill expressed confidence in Cohen's chairmanship and GameStop's transformation. Most importantly, Gill demonstrated on live TV that he did not have the control that the financial media claimed. Time and time again the stock price changed instantly based on Gill's carefully chosen words and phrases - it was impossible Gill was pulling the strings:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dbm589/rks\_livestream\_was\_a\_calculated\_masterclass\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dbm589/rks_livestream_was_a_calculated_masterclass_to/)

The many price fluctuations triggered limps (small pauses where trading is stopped if the share price changes too quickly). According to the SEC's rules, you can only short when the share price is on the way up - except during a slump. Gill demonstrated that short sellers deliberately used algorithms to fabricate halts to manipulate the market:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dal9vi/circuit\_breaker\_manipulation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dal9vi/circuit_breaker_manipulation/)

During after-hours (after market close), GME inexplicably jumped between $30 and $60. Gill's calls for 12 million shares, GameStop's sale of 45 million new stocks, and the market maker's tons of FTDs approaching delivery suddenly caused the algorithms to lose control of GME:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dalrap/big\_random\_jumps\_in\_postmarket\_can\_anyone\_elia5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dalrap/big_random_jumps_in_postmarket_can_anyone_elia5/)

# Uno Reverse - Bruno's green vision

On June 13, Gill had sold his GME calls and bought another 4 million shares, so he now held 9,001,000. It was the exact same number of shares Cohen held on December 18, 2020, when he increased his position. Gill could have sold for $1 billion on May 13, but he chose instead to hold on - and increase his position a month later. Gill's choice turned out to be about FTDs, and he had a plan. Market makers are legally obliged to deliver shares from traded calls within 1-2 days, but delivery of shares from ""normal"" purchases must be delayed as FTDs for up to 35 days. An analysis from 2024 actually showed that since 2012, market makers had naked shorted GME with uncontrolled loans from ETFs like XRT. This shorting created a cycle of FTDs to be closed after no later than 35 days:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Q00MK-f1g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Q00MK-f1g)

This was supported by a thorough analysis from 2022, which showed that only two shares (including Tesla) and nine ETFs (including XRT) out of the market's approx. 38,000 had had more FTDs than GME in the previous 10 years…  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wk5kmf/last\_week\_i\_reported\_how\_gamestop\_had\_more\_ftds/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wk5kmf/last_week_i_reported_how_gamestop_had_more_ftds/)

In addition, data from FINRA (in the period 2022-2024) showed that GME consistently rose much more than all other stocks and funds in the market when billions of FTDs in the global system closed simultaneously:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dnluum/cat\_error\_theory\_is\_a\_market\_wide\_phenomenon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dnluum/cat_error_theory_is_a_market_wide_phenomenon/)

It was known that Gill had bought 2 million shares on May 13, so FTDs from here would close on June 17. In the same week, investors could trade calls for 10 million shares. However, nothing further happened - since April, 750 million shares that flowed through the OTC market and dark pools, postponed the closing of FTDs. In fact, data showed that from August 2020 to May 2024, over 8 billion GameStop shares were handled, and half of those trades had gone through the OTC market and dark pools. The primary players were Citadel Securities, Virtu, G1, Jane Street, UBS and Interactive Brokers - more acquaintances from 2021:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dehtux/the\_gme\_otc\_conspiracy\_a\_deep\_dive\_into\_over\_200/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dehtux/the_gme_otc_conspiracy_a_deep_dive_into_over_200/)

On June 2nd, when Gill revealed his position, he also sent the first of 10 new memes - an ""Uno Reverse"" card. The cycle of FTDs would soon enforce, not suppress, price discovery. By buying calls in April, Gill started a cycle and observed FTDs being delivered. This allowed Gill to predict price movements and thus when to either buy calls underpinning GME, or sell calls and buy stocks, starting a new cycle that accumulated FTDs. It was interesting here that the share sales on May 17 and June 7 both happened on the first day of a new cycle:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1doh4z5/here\_is\_a\_breakdown\_of\_the\_analysis\_by\_biggy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1doh4z5/here_is_a_breakdown_of_the_analysis_by_biggy/)

Cohen probably knew GME was diluted by phantom shares - now they were converted to equity:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ttlu4o/eureka\_ive\_found\_it\_i\_have\_found\_the\_bloody/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ttlu4o/eureka_ive_found_it_i_have_found_the_bloody/)

At the same time, it turned out that the price developments in August/September 2020 and May/June 2024 mirrored each other. If the trend continued, ""January 2021"" would be repeated in mid-October 2024:

However, the share price in July did not continue up as expected, and the explanation was hidden in another of the 10 new memes (from June 17). This was showing Bruno from the film Encanto, who hid for 10 years and returned with a green vision - in the world of stocks, a ""green candle"" means that the price will rise. If the 10 years meant Gill waited 10 weeks, he would return by August 30. It was supported by an academic study by GME - written in the city of ""Brno""... It showed that FTDs from ETFs most often started a cycle, but that the closing of the cycle's FTDs only affected the share price in certain periods:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1disrmb/academic\_paper\_gamestop\_gme\_value\_cycle\_affected/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1disrmb/academic_paper_gamestop_gme_value_cycle_affected/)

Gill seemed to be waiting for cheap calls and that the time was once again ripe for a new, explosive cycle:

# A timeline of emojis - Kansas City Shuffle

Some of the original 110 memes referred to the movie Signs, which showed three omens before its climax. On May 13, GME exploded - ""The first sign you can't explain"". On June 6, GME rose again, and that ruled out a one-off - ""The second sign you can't ignore"". The beginning of the end would probably happen around August 2, when the film was released in its time - ""The third sign you won't believe"":

The cryptic prediction that something extraordinary would happen also showed up in another meme. Gill had created a timeline of 35 emojis that referenced Cohen's tweets and events in GameStop's history — in addition to some as-yet-unknown incidents. On June 27, Gill posted one of the last emojis on the timeline — a dog. Then five emojis appeared - an American flag with a microphone on it, a pair of eyes focused on the flag, a flame, an explosion and two toasting beer mugs. Gill believed that ""something"" violent would soon happen (perhaps a market crash) and that afterwards you could celebrate GME:

However, the dog in Gill's tweet was looking to the right - the wrong way compared to the dog in the video. It was a sign that he was going to perform a ""Kansas City Shuffle"" - a deceptive trick from the movie Lucky Number Slevin. Here, the opponents (e.g. short sellers) think they are about to win (naked shorting), but in fact they are looking the wrong way and are unknowingly steering towards their downfall. An obvious candidate was Cohen's old pet company, Chewy. On May 29, Chewy had announced a share buyback, and the ETF XRT was restructured with Chewy as its largest position. On June 24, Gill suddenly bought calls for 20 million Chewy shares, and on June 27 he sent the dog. On July 1, Gill sold his calls and bought 9,001,000 shares for the second time - a clear nod to Cohen. This pushed XRT to deliver tons of FTDs to close by August 5th:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dsro2t/chwy\_swaps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dsro2t/chwy_swaps/)

Just on August 5, Japan raised the interest rate on the Yen for the first time in over 10 years, which caused a global mini-crash. Incredibly, Gill had predicted the crash in his live stream on June 7 - the background image showed the Japanese parliament working frantically as a green candle loomed - the fire emoji:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ekndkl/the\_panic\_has\_begun/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ekndkl/the_panic_has_begun/)

Although the crash only lasted a day, it managed to create billions of FTDs that were to be closed by September 9th. Such a large amount of FTDs in the global system had consistently foreshadowed that GME would soon increase greatly. However, there would be another event on September 9 - a merger. The next emoji on the timeline was the American flag with a microphone on it - it was the only emoji that was made up of two others. On June 17, the two companies Sirius XM and Liberty Media had actually announced a ""1:10"" merger, and on the same day at At 1:10 Gill sent a meme with the witty pun ""You cannot be serious"". Then, on July 31, ""someone"" suddenly bought calls for 50 million Sirius Shares.

Gill had misled the algorithms that ran GME into misusing ETFs against the wrong stock (Chewy), inadvertently setting a time bomb under himself that would go off when his ""shuffle"" began in earnest. It also turned out that Sirius means ""dog star"". The flag on the timeline could refer to September 9, but why was the merger important and when would you reach the fire emoji?

When GME stagnated in July, an analysis had shown that underlying mechanisms (with roots in the price increase in May) would cause GME to rise sharply at the end of August - a so-called melt-up:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi6alMAG2\_M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi6alMAG2_M)

On August 30, GME had its biggest increase (9%) since May 13. That was 110 days after Gill posted the first of the original 110 memes, and 10 weeks (equivalent to the 10 new memes) after the Bruno meme. It was also striking that the last of the 10 new memes showed a naked Wolverine (from the X-Men film universe) fighting for his life - had the market maker received a margin call?

# Dog Days Are Over - Margin call

On September 6, Gill posted another new meme (#121) - a toy dog dropped on the floor. The dog's eyes looked to the left - Gill's ""shuffle"" was in progress. Now his meme of the song Dog Days Are Over suddenly made sense. The term meant that the hard times were over, but here it also marked that Chewy had served his purpose. The algorithms had focused on Chewy, thereby putting XRT out of the game. Profits from Chewy would go to GME so Gill could buy new calls when the time was right:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dro4bd/dfvs\_final\_memes\_explained\_from\_dog\_days\_moass/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dro4bd/dfvs_final_memes_explained_from_dog_days_moass/)

Another important detail was that Gill's famous timeline of emojis actually appeared in a video. When shown the dog and the flag, these emojis were briefly gray and then changed to color. It was a clear reference to a well-known scene from the Wizard of Oz - when the film changed from black and white to color, you were no longer in Kansas... Gill's ""shuffle"" was only complete when both emojis had played their part. Through September, Sirius stock fell, so it seemed likely that the link between the merger and the flag had also been part of the deception. What could the flag and microphone refer to? The answer came on the same day, September 6, when ""someone"" bought 6399 GameStop calls - the number 6399 is a well-known sign from a guardian angel. It appeared from the transaction's technical fields ""Flags"" and ""Mic"" that it had taken place physically (highly unusual) and in Massachusetts, where Gill was from. His ""shuffle"" was (*presumably*) over:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1fbipl7/comment/lm0wwin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1fbipl7/comment/lm0wwin/)

Several analyzes had predicted that the GME would soon explode again. This time, however, GME would start at twice the share price, and the private investors knew the timeline and Gill's signature purchase. The third massive, price increase that was expected at the beginning of August, which was supposed to herald the beginning of the end, was replaced by a mini-crash, and exactly 35 days later the GME peaked - the cycle forced price discovery again. Bruno held the green candle, but who would light it?  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYxiPQWgvOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYxiPQWgvOM)

On September 10, the quarterly report again showed a small financial profit, but also falling income due to the strategically closed businesses - and no active plans for the billion savings. At the same time, GameStop announced another stock sale (of 20 million shares) in the wake of the recent price increase, and GME fell 20%. Cohen, who had been CEO for just under a year, stood to lose the most from the dilution, so he had to have a plan. It was also reassuring that since 2020 Gill had been very bullish about big future share sales because it provided capital for further transformation:

The two major stock sales in May and June had been completed in a matter of days, but this third, relatively small stock sale had still not gone through after more than a week - stock trading was bone-dry and GME lay steady around $20. Then, on September 20, over 20 million shares were suddenly bought, and GME rose by 12%. Once again the timing seemed predictable - was Gill a time traveler?

It was common knowledge that ETFs restructured their positions (shares bought/sold) on the penultimate Friday of a quarter - here on September 20. After the dilutions in May and June, there was 40% more GameStop stock in play, but the ETFs should have already accounted for these dilutions on June 21 so there had to be another, better explanation for the sudden, violent share buying. September 20 was 110 days after June 2, when Gill revealed himself and sent an ""Uno Reverse"" card. The effect of Gill's May and June stocks and calls was finally kicking in, and it looked like Wolverine (or some other player) had gotten a margin call on 30 August and 20 September.

For decades, the SEC had failed to eliminate the problem of unfettered naked shorting. Now it looked like a small gaming company's stock could cause Wall Street to undergo a domino collapse and start MOASS:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/18z9wf3/sec\_chairman\_cox\_on\_naked\_short\_selling\_2008/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/18z9wf3/sec_chairman_cox_on_naked_short_selling_2008/)

# 35 and 110 - The algorithms are tamed

Gill's share purchase on May 13 was almost 35 days before June 13, when he bought 4 million shares at once - was there a connection? In any case, it was known that the share purchase in June (also) was delivered as FTDs, which had to be closed on 18 July. If E-Trade (Morgan Stanley) could not close these FTDs, the DTCC's rules allowed the issue to be postponed for a good two months - until exactly September 20:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1fljzed/gme\_heres\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1fljzed/gme_heres_why/)

It was also known that FINRA's REX code 068 could give certain types of unstable players a three-week extension to resolve margin calls - e.g. a market maker. If the issue had not been resolved, the position would be forcibly closed over the next two weeks. This system explained the mechanisms and timing behind both January 2021 and May/June 2024 crystal clear. The price increase on August 30 indicated that Wolverine had received a margin call, which explained the stock purchase on September 20 - exactly three weeks later. It would also explain why stock trading in these three weeks had been bone-dry. If you counted 35 days and a good two months behind, a margin call on August 30 would originate from May 24 - just a week before Gill revealed his 12 million calls…. E-Trade and Wolverine were naked and suddenly forced to buy millions of shares before October 4 - at the end of the cycle from August 30. At the same time, they had to prevent GME from rising, so that no more margin calls came:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1flmjcy/potential\_rex\_068\_margin\_deficiency\_extension/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1flmjcy/potential_rex_068_margin_deficiency_extension/)

On September 23, the 20 million shares have finally been sold. GameStop now had 446 million shares at stake in the market and $4.6 billion in savings. According to the analyst who predicted the price rise at the end of August, $22 was a crucial battlefront if the underlying mechanisms were to result in the long-awaited melt-up - now GME was conveniently fixed at this share price. In a few days, the green fire would be lit by the same players who had tried to put it out.

The timing held another possibility (**SPECULATION WARNING**). If Credit Suisse (UBS) had bought LEAPS that offset their short position from June 30, 2021, they would expire on September 30 - and October 1 was 110 days after June 13… If this short position (70% of GME) suddenly became a red number in UBS's accounts, they risked a margin call. This would start a cycle of FTDs, which (according to DTCC's rules) could be postponed until **13th of January 2025**. After that, the position would be closed by the deadline of **January 27**. It was both striking that three cycles after October 14 hit January 27 and that 110 days after September 30 would be in the middle of the forced shutdown… All FTDs from the cycles Gill had started would hit at the same time.

The theory was supported by a cryptic message - on September 13, exactly 4 months after Gill sent the first of his 110 memes, his brother posted a picture online with the text ""Midway"". After another 4 months it would be 13th of January 2025 - when UBS's final margin call (*presumably*) would arrive... The numbers matched - the explosion emoji had a possible cut off date:

Both ""35"" and ""110"" seemed important - and not only for GME. Gills Chewy shares from July 1 started a cycle that coincided with the crash on August 5, the effect of which was delayed until September 9 and then until October 14 - exactly 110 days after Gills Chewy calls from June 24. On July 31, ""someone"" had bought Sirius calls expiring on September 9, and 35 days thereafter would be October 14. From this date the two cycles would be in sync. After another cycle of FTDs ended up on November 18 which was 110 days after July 31… Sirius had had tons of FTDs in June and July and Gill took advantage. His ""shuffle"" had (*presumably*) been to trick the algorithms into starting cycles in Chewy and Sirius, which would eventually connect - and hit GME at the most critical time.

Gill was obviously exploiting a set of complex rules that few understood to manipulate a corrupt system that was controlled by (near) unstoppable algorithms. Algorithms that were introduced decades ago by e.g. Citadel LLC and BlackRock, and who now steered their masters towards doom:

# The masterpiece - Power to the Players

After January 28, 2021, when the buy button was removed, corrupt players such as Citadel Securities, Virtu, G1, Jane Street, UBS and Interactive Brokers had used e.g. dark pools, OTC, FTDs, ETFs, swaps and LEAPS to hide their naked shorting. When GME was around $10, LEAPS were opened which supported huge swaps. After 39 months, these LEAPS were expiring and the algorithms had brought GME down to $10 again, hiding the problem again. Along the way, 200,000 private investors held on with ""diamond hands"". One private investor in particular knew all the rules of the game and his masterpiece would be to use the hubris of the corrupt players against them. By buying a large amount of stocks and calls at this critical time, he fixed GME at a ""too high"" share price and caught the broker E-Trade and the market maker Wolverine in their own web. It started two cycles of FTDs, which (in usual hubris) were delayed as long as possible and ended up hitting the trading chain simultaneously - just before the LEAPS that (*presumably*) carried UBS's insurmountable short position would expire. An inevitable domino collapse was set in motion. As a savvy film director, Gill had entertained his audience with cryptic omens that came true with improbable accuracy. Behind the scenes, Gill passively watched a series of pieces topple over in slow motion - at the end of which was a firing button. The rocket, which was ready to take ""GME to the Moon"", was filled with fuel from decades of market manipulation. Gill was not a time traveler but a space traveler ahead of his time.

According to Gensler, everyone was free to talk about and buy shares. Gill had simply bought and held a manipulated stock. The corrupt links in the trade chain had lined up the pieces for their own domino collapse, which would (*presumably*) reach its inevitable climax in January 2025 - ""dumb money"".

In a few years, Gill had turned $50,000 into a billion. He could have lived in peace and luxury, but chose again (and again) to bet everything on GME. Gill was truly transformed from the private investor Roaring Kitty into his ""diamond hands"" alter ego DeepFuckingValue. This living legend inspired a global movement of individual investors to break with tradition and hold on to their stocks to defy the established, corrupt system - ""Power to the Players"".

When Gill would choose to go ""all in"", thousands of private investors would follow suit and force market makers to hedge calls, which were converted into shares, which raised the share price, so that even higher calls had to be hedged - a so-called gamma squeeze. Combined with a short squeeze, it would bring down all the corrupt (naked) links in the trade chain in one fell swoop:

# Outro (another prediction)

It was known that the sales of 120 million shares in May and June had hardly increased the 10 largest institutions' long positions - the shares had probably moved to close short positions and postpone FTDs. Samples from 2021 had shown that there were over 6 times too many shares in play, so even if GameStop sold its remaining stock of approx. 570 million shares, there would be naked short sellers left. MOASS could easily make GameStop one of the world's richest companies, and if Cohen then issued a cash dividend, the short sellers would have to pay the investors - for every single (phantom) share:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1evk2tv/update\_what\_happened\_to\_the\_120\_million\_shares/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1evk2tv/update_what_happened_to_the_120_million_shares/)

At the same time as there was speculation about how ""January 2021"" would repeat itself, another time parallel unfolded. On June 21, 2007, the Japanese Yen peaked, and 110 days later the ""S&P 500"" index peaked... After this, the market began to crash, and the bottom was only hit in March 2009 - after a fall of over 50%. In 2024, on July 2, the Yen peaked again, and 35 days later the Japanese crash hit... The price trend continued to mirror 2007, and if the trend continued, the ""S&P 500"" index would peak on **October 20, 2024,** (110 days later) and predict a new global economic crisis. Was the ""110 days"" a predictable fixed point for the algorithms? Was that the secret ingredient in Gill's masterpiece? Regardless, many innocents would soon lose their savings and housing in the process - ""Don't dance"":

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long-time lurker here. I've been composing a big write-up about GME for several years and I want to share the second part with you guys... Things are up for discussion, and I may have miscounted a settlement day somewhere, but most of it's rock solid IMO.

Feedback on improvement is very welcome, but I've google translated from another language, so don't fry me over petite grammatical flaws. When GME runs above sneeze levels, I'm going to Reddit and the press with the full story. So the more flaws/fallacies you can spot the better. Crosspost to SS welcome (not enough k@rma).

Towards the end of this wall of text is a very detailed, possible timeline of all the FTD cycles since april 2024 - ending with the beginning of MOASS in January 2025.

# April 2024 - Run Lola Run

Between 24-26th of April 2024, when GME was around $10, blocks of unusually large calls (potential future purchase orders) were opened at $20. Calls pressure market makers to hedge (cover by buying shares), which underpins a high share price for a period. The reason is that the market maker must have enough shares in stock if many calls are traded. However, calls have a fee and an expiration date - and if the share price is too low when the time has passed, they become worthless.

On May 9 (after over 3 years of hibernation), Keith Gill suddenly liked a tweet of the famous scene in the film  
Run Lola Run, where the protagonist bet on the roulette number ""20"" - and won. Then, on May 12, Gill sent a meme - now it got serious. D. May 13, in the pre-market (before market opening hours), GME exploded to 80 dollars (equivalent to 320 before the 1:4 split). As private investors do not normally have access to the pre-market, they could not have driven the price movement - was it Gill's doing?  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cs5j2j/for\_those\_outside\_reddit\_how\_retail\_is\_moving/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cs5j2j/for_those_outside_reddit_how_retail_is_moving/)

From 12-17th of May, Gill posted a total of 110 amusing, cryptic memes - they would prove important:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkuQL4wjLLQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkuQL4wjLLQ)

At the same time, approx. 90% of trades ran through the far less regulated OTC market, which retail investors don't normally have access to either, and GME quickly fell to a steady $20:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ctg3y7/99\_of\_trades\_take\_place\_in\_the\_otc\_market\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ctg3y7/99_of_trades_take_place_in_the_otc_market_the/)

In mid-May, huge calls for over 12 million shares opened at $20 - again just like the bet in Run Lola Run. Then, on May 17, GameStop sold 45 million new shares on the market and doubled the savings to $2 billion. It was similar to the same move Cohen had made in April and June 2021 - as GME surged, GameStop sold $1.5 billion worth of new stock. However, the DRS movement was critical of the dilution of GME because the DRS figure fell as savings increased.

On June 2, Gill revealed that he holds 5 million shares and calls for 12 million shares - the cat was out of the bag:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d6wy8d/sharing\_data\_the\_days\_dfv\_added\_an\_important/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d6wy8d/sharing_data_the_days_dfv_added_an_important/)

It was later counted that Gill had bought calls for 14 million shares, so where were the rest? ~~The answer had to be found at GameStop. On May 13, when GME hit 80 dollars, GameStop bought back 2 million shares. Gill was probably testing the market's (algorithms') response to him trading a big call, and GameStop was just making a natural counter move to the sudden, aggressive acquisition of GME:~~  
(Open for technical discussion. Possibly just Gill, and not also GameStop, purchasing 2 million shares):  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cr75i8/comment/l3w2e47/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cr75i8/comment/l3w2e47/)

But how did Gill time his return? Probably by analyzing calls. It makes sense for short sellers to buy calls (potential shares) if they want the balance sheet to look balanced. LEAPS are a type of calls that can run for up to 39 months. Exactly 39 months before May 2024 was February 2021 when GME was shorted down to $10… In March 2021 GME was pushed down again - these LEAPS' expiration date would be June 2024. If the theory was correct, his calls maintained such a high share price, that short sellers couldn't buy new cheap LEAPS when the old ones expired:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cs5rkk/leaps\_i\_think\_i\_stumbled\_on\_something\_need\_brains/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cs5rkk/leaps_i_think_i_stumbled_on_something_need_brains/)

At the same time, it turned out that swaps for 2 billion dollars had expired in 2024. Short sellers must have had a hard time hiding the phantom shares:  
[https://youtu.be/X-\_Pnzkv810?si=yAAx72lNPp9K4VpI&t=1292](https://youtu.be/X-_Pnzkv810?si=yAAx72lNPp9K4VpI&t=1292)

Back in January 2021, most retail investors had arguably taken $250 (1,000 before the 1:4 split). Now, years of extreme price swings, educating discussions on Reddit forums, and outrage over a blatantly corrupt system that called private investors ""dumb money"" had left hundreds of thousands with ""diamond hands"" - they wouldn't sell until GME hit thousands (or million) of dollars under MOASS. Now you would see bankruptcies, domino collapses and prison time at the corrupt hedge funds, brokers, banks, market makers and clearing houses. Afterwards, a fair market could be built.

# The tide goes out - The algorithms are revealed

On June 5, CNBC host Jim Cramer interviewed SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Cramer accused Gill of market manipulation, but Gensler ruled that everyone is free to talk about and buy stocks: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d8qid7/gary\_gensler\_vs\_jim\_cramer\_about\_dfv\_no\_lie\_or/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d8qid7/gary_gensler_vs_jim_cramer_about_dfv_no_lie_or/)

The accusation was particularly ironic, since Cramer himself had told in detail how his hedge fund manipulated the market in 2006. Moreover, his job at CNBC for two decades was to promote the buying and selling of certain stocks - for example, he recommended the stock of the bank Bear Stearns days before the 2008 crash…  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d8tcfm/jim\_cramer\_on\_how\_he\_manipulated](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d8tcfm/jim_cramer_on_how_he_manipulated)

According to the financial media The Wall Street Journal, the broker E-Trade (an old acquaintance from 2021) talked about throwing Gill off their platform, which was denied. Had E-trade simply delivered IOUs?  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d88qd5/i\_think\_its\_clear\_why\_rk\_is\_getting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d88qd5/i_think_its_clear_why_rk_is_getting)

At the same time, data revealed that the market maker who had sold calls to Gill had taken the fee without hedging a single stock:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d8qtaa/they\_never\_hedged/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d8qtaa/they_never_hedged/)

It soon turned out that this market maker was Wolverine - another old familiar from 2021:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dd7je1/strong\_indication\_that\_wolverine\_trading\_is\_naked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dd7je1/strong_indication_that_wolverine_trading_is_naked/)

The corrupt links in the trade chain had lined up the pieces for their own domino collapse, and Gill seemed to know when it would begin. As the investor Warren Buffett once so poetically said: ""Only when the tide goes out do you learn who has been swimming naked.""

On June 6th, what no one had dared to hope for happened - Gill announced a new live stream. Thousands of investors poured in and GME rose to $65. Everyone was restlessly waiting for June 7. It would be the 5th anniversary of Gill's very first purchase of GME - and oddly enough the 25th anniversary of Run Lola Run.

On June 7, GameStop sold an additional 75 million new shares on the market - the savings doubled again and were now well over $4 billion. With 426 million shares in play on the market, GME had been diluted by 40% in a few weeks, but the savings had quadrupled - a sensible barter for the company. The critical voices grew over the dilution, but the insiders' investments had also been diluted. In addition, insiders had primarily sold shares for tax reasons for years. Cohen and the board were personally invested in a long-term strategy, and they clearly knew how to do it.

By the evening of June 7, over 600,000 people were tuning in to Gill's channel, and millions of viewers were watching the live stream on CNBC. Gill enjoyed himself with people on the chat, showed his long position and told E-Trade: ""I see those headlines... Don't make me remove it."" Afterwards, Gill expressed confidence in Cohen's chairmanship and GameStop's transformation. Most importantly, Gill demonstrated on live TV that he did not have the control that the financial media claimed. Time and time again the stock price changed instantly based on Gill's carefully chosen words and phrases - it was impossible Gill was pulling the strings:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dbm589/rks\_livestream\_was\_a\_calculated\_masterclass\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dbm589/rks_livestream_was_a_calculated_masterclass_to/)

The many price fluctuations triggered limps (small pauses where trading is stopped if the share price changes too quickly). According to the SEC's rules, you can only short when the share price is on the way up - except during a slump. Gill demonstrated that short sellers deliberately used algorithms to fabricate halts to manipulate the market:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dal9vi/circuit\_breaker\_manipulation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dal9vi/circuit_breaker_manipulation/)

During after-hours (after market close), GME inexplicably jumped between $30 and $60. Gill's calls for 12 million shares, GameStop's sale of 45 million new stocks, and the market maker's tons of FTDs approaching delivery suddenly caused the algorithms to lose control of GME:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dalrap/big\_random\_jumps\_in\_postmarket\_can\_anyone\_elia5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dalrap/big_random_jumps_in_postmarket_can_anyone_elia5/)

# Uno Reverse - Bruno's green vision

On June 13, Gill had sold his GME calls and bought another 4 million shares, so he now held 9,001,000. It was the exact same number of shares Cohen held on December 18, 2020, when he increased his position. Gill could have sold for $1 billion on May 13, but he chose instead to hold on - and increase his position a month later. Gill's choice turned out to be about FTDs, and he had a plan. Market makers are legally obliged to deliver shares from traded calls within 1-2 days, but delivery of shares from ""normal"" purchases must be delayed as FTDs for up to 35 days. An analysis from 2024 actually showed that since 2012, market makers had naked shorted GME with uncontrolled loans from ETFs like XRT. This shorting created a cycle of FTDs to be closed after no later than 35 days:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Q00MK-f1g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Q00MK-f1g)

This was supported by a thorough analysis from 2022, which showed that only two shares (including Tesla) and nine ETFs (including XRT) out of the market's approx. 38,000 had had more FTDs than GME in the previous 10 years…

In addition, data from FINRA (in the period 2022-2024) showed that GME consistently rose much more than all other stocks and funds in the market when billions of FTDs in the global system closed simultaneously:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dnluum/cat\_error\_theory\_is\_a\_market\_wide\_phenomenon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dnluum/cat_error_theory_is_a_market_wide_phenomenon/)

It was known that Gill had bought 2 million shares on May 13, so FTDs from here would close on June 17. In the same week, investors could trade calls for 10 million shares. However, nothing further happened - since April, 750 million shares that flowed through the OTC market and dark pools, postponed the closing of FTDs. In fact, data showed that from August 2020 to May 2024, over 8 billion GameStop shares were handled, and half of those trades had gone through the OTC market and dark pools. The primary players were Citadel Securities, Virtu, G1, Jane Street, UBS and Interactive Brokers - more acquaintances from 2021:

On June 2nd, when Gill revealed his position, he also sent the first of 10 new memes - an ""Uno Reverse"" card. The cycle of FTDs would soon enforce, not suppress, price discovery. By buying calls in April, Gill started a cycle and observed FTDs being delivered. This allowed Gill to predict price movements and thus when to either buy calls underpinning GME, or sell calls and buy stocks, starting a new cycle that accumulated FTDs. It was interesting here that the share sales on May 17 and June 7 both happened on the first day of a new cycle:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1doh4z5/here\_is\_a\_breakdown\_of\_the\_analysis\_by\_biggy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1doh4z5/here_is_a_breakdown_of_the_analysis_by_biggy/)

Cohen probably knew GME was diluted by phantom shares - now they were converted to equity:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ttlu4o/eureka\_ive\_found\_it\_i\_have\_found\_the\_bloody/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ttlu4o/eureka_ive_found_it_i_have_found_the_bloody/)

At the same time, it turned out that the price developments in August/September 2020 and May/June 2024 mirrored each other. If the trend continued, ""January 2021"" would be repeated in mid-October 2024:

However, the share price in July did not continue up as expected, and the explanation was hidden in another of the 10 new memes (from June 17). This was showing Bruno from the film Encanto, who hid for 10 years and returned with a green vision - in the world of stocks, a ""green candle"" means that the price will rise. If the 10 years meant Gill waited 10 weeks, he would return by August 30. It was supported by an academic study by GME - written in the city of ""Brno""... It showed that FTDs from ETFs most often started a cycle, but that the closing of the cycle's FTDs only affected the share price in certain periods:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1disrmb/academic\_paper\_gamestop\_gme\_value\_cycle\_affected/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1disrmb/academic_paper_gamestop_gme_value_cycle_affected/)

Gill seemed to be waiting for cheap calls and that the time was once again ripe for a new, explosive cycle:

# A timeline of emojis - Kansas City Shuffle

Some of the original 110 memes referred to the movie Signs, which showed three omens before its climax. On May 13, GME exploded - ""The first sign you can't explain"". On June 6, GME rose again, and that ruled out a one-off - ""The second sign you can't ignore"". The beginning of the end would probably happen around August 2, when the film was released in its time - ""The third sign you won't believe"":

The cryptic prediction that something extraordinary would happen also showed up in another meme. Gill had created a timeline of 35 emojis that referenced Cohen's tweets and events in GameStop's history — in addition to some as-yet-unknown incidents. On June 27, Gill posted one of the last emojis on the timeline — a dog. Then five emojis appeared - an American flag with a microphone on it, a pair of eyes focused on the flag, a flame, an explosion and two toasting beer mugs. Gill believed that ""something"" violent would soon happen (perhaps a market crash) and that afterwards you could celebrate GME:

However, the dog in Gill's tweet was looking to the right - the wrong way compared to the dog in the video. It was a sign that he was going to perform a ""Kansas City Shuffle"" - a deceptive trick from the movie Lucky Number Slevin. Here, the opponents (e.g. short sellers) think they are about to win (naked shorting), but in fact they are looking the wrong way and are unknowingly steering towards their downfall. An obvious candidate was Cohen's old pet company, Chewy. On May 29, Chewy had announced a share buyback, and the ETF XRT was restructured with Chewy as its largest position. On June 24, Gill suddenly bought calls for 20 million Chewy shares, and on June 27 he sent the dog. On July 1, Gill sold his calls and bought 9,001,000 shares for the second time - a clear nod to Cohen. This pushed XRT to deliver tons of FTDs to close by August 5th:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dsro2t/chwy\_swaps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dsro2t/chwy_swaps/)

Just on August 5, Japan raised the interest rate on the Yen for the first time in over 10 years, which caused a global mini-crash. Incredibly, Gill had predicted the crash in his live stream on June 7 - the background image showed the Japanese parliament working frantically as a green candle loomed - the fire emoji:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ekndkl/the\_panic\_has\_begun/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ekndkl/the_panic_has_begun/)

Although the crash only lasted a day, it managed to create billions of FTDs that were to be closed by September 9th. Such a large amount of FTDs in the global system had consistently foreshadowed that GME would soon increase greatly. However, there would be another event on September 9 - a merger. The next emoji on the timeline was the American flag with a microphone on it - it was the only emoji that was made up of two others. On June 17, the two companies Sirius XM and Liberty Media had actually announced a ""1:10"" merger, and on the same day at At 1:10 Gill sent a meme with the witty pun ""You cannot be serious"". Then, on July 31, ""someone"" suddenly bought calls for 50 million Sirius Shares.

Gill had misled the algorithms that ran GME into misusing ETFs against the wrong stock (Chewy), inadvertently setting a time bomb under himself that would go off when his ""shuffle"" began in earnest. It also turned out that Sirius means ""dog star"". The flag on the timeline could refer to September 9, but why was the merger important and when would you reach the fire emoji?

When GME stagnated in July, an analysis had shown that underlying mechanisms (with roots in the price increase in May) would cause GME to rise sharply at the end of August - a so-called melt-up:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi6alMAG2\_M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi6alMAG2_M)

On August 30, GME had its biggest increase (9%) since May 13. That was 110 days after Gill posted the first of the original 110 memes, and 10 weeks (equivalent to the 10 new memes) after the Bruno meme. It was also striking that the last of the 10 new memes showed a naked Wolverine (from the X-Men film universe) fighting for his life - had the market maker received a margin call?

# Dog Days Are Over - Margin call

On September 6, Gill posted another new meme (#121) - a toy dog dropped on the floor. The dog's eyes looked to the left - Gill's ""shuffle"" was in progress. Now his meme of the song Dog Days Are Over suddenly made sense. The term meant that the hard times were over, but here it also marked that Chewy had served his purpose. The algorithms had focused on Chewy, thereby putting XRT out of the game. Profits from Chewy would go to GME so Gill could buy new calls when the time was right:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dro4bd/dfvs\_final\_memes\_explained\_from\_dog\_days\_moass/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dro4bd/dfvs_final_memes_explained_from_dog_days_moass/)

Another important detail was that Gill's famous timeline of emojis actually appeared in a video. When shown the dog and the flag, these emojis were briefly gray and then changed to color. It was a clear reference to a well-known scene from the Wizard of Oz - when the film changed from black and white to color, you were no longer in Kansas... Gill's ""shuffle"" was only complete when both emojis had played their part. Through September, Sirius stock fell, so it seemed likely that the link between the merger and the flag had also been part of the deception. What could the flag and microphone refer to? The answer came on the same day, September 6, when ""someone"" bought 6399 GameStop calls - the number 6399 is a well-known sign from a guardian angel. It appeared from the transaction's technical fields ""Flags"" and ""Mic"" that it had taken place physically (highly unusual) and in Massachusetts, where Gill was from. His ""shuffle"" was (*presumably*) over:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1fbipl7/comment/lm0wwin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1fbipl7/comment/lm0wwin/)

Several analyzes had predicted that the GME would soon explode again. This time, however, GME would start at twice the share price, and the private investors knew the timeline and Gill's signature purchase. The third massive, price increase that was expected at the beginning of August, which was supposed to herald the beginning of the end, was replaced by a mini-crash, and exactly 35 days later the GME peaked - the cycle forced price discovery again. Bruno held the green candle, but who would light it?  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYxiPQWgvOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYxiPQWgvOM)

On September 10, the quarterly report again showed a small financial profit, but also falling income due to the strategically closed businesses - and no active plans for the billion savings. At the same time, GameStop announced another stock sale (of 20 million shares) in the wake of the recent price increase, and GME fell 20%. Cohen, who had been CEO for just under a year, stood to lose the most from the dilution, so he had to have a plan. It was also reassuring that since 2020 Gill had been very bullish about big future share sales because it provided capital for further transformation:

The two major stock sales in May and June had been completed in a matter of days, but this third, relatively small stock sale had still not gone through after more than a week - stock trading was bone-dry and GME lay steady around $20. Then, on September 20, over 20 million shares were suddenly bought, and GME rose by 12%. Once again the timing seemed predictable - was Gill a time traveler?

It was common knowledge that ETFs restructured their positions (shares bought/sold) on the penultimate Friday of a quarter - here on September 20. After the dilutions in May and June, there was 40% more GameStop stock in play, but the ETFs should have already accounted for these dilutions on June 21 so there had to be another, better explanation for the sudden, violent share buying. September 20 was 110 days after June 2, when Gill revealed himself and sent an ""Uno Reverse"" card. The effect of Gill's May and June stocks and calls was finally kicking in, and it looked like Wolverine (or some other player) had gotten a margin call on 30 August and 20 September.

For decades, the SEC had failed to eliminate the problem of unfettered naked shorting. Now it looked like a small gaming company's stock could cause Wall Street to undergo a domino collapse and start MOASS:

# 35 and 110 - The algorithms are tamed

Gill's share purchase on May 13 was almost 35 days before June 13, when he bought 4 million shares at once - was there a connection? In any case, it was known that the share purchase in June (also) was delivered as FTDs, which had to be closed on 18 July. If E-Trade (Morgan Stanley) could not close these FTDs, the DTCC's rules allowed the issue to be postponed for a good two months - until exactly September 20:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1fljzed/gme\_heres\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1fljzed/gme_heres_why/)

It was also known that FINRA's REX code 068 could give certain types of unstable players a three-week extension to resolve margin calls - e.g. a market maker. If the issue had not been resolved, the position would be forcibly closed over the next two weeks. This system explained the mechanisms and timing behind both January 2021 and May/June 2024 crystal clear. The price increase on August 30 indicated that Wolverine had received a margin call, which explained the stock purchase on September 20 - exactly three weeks later. It would also explain why stock trading in these three weeks had been bone-dry. If you counted 35 days and a good two months behind, a margin call on August 30 would originate from May 24 - just a week before Gill revealed his 12 million calls…. E-Trade and Wolverine were naked and suddenly forced to buy millions of shares before October 4 - at the end of the cycle from August 30. At the same time, they had to prevent GME from rising, so that no more margin calls came:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1flmjcy/potential\_rex\_068\_margin\_deficiency\_extension/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1flmjcy/potential_rex_068_margin_deficiency_extension/)

On September 23, the 20 million shares have finally been sold. GameStop now had 446 million shares at stake in the market and $4.6 billion in savings. According to the analyst who predicted the price rise at the end of August, $22 was a crucial battlefront if the underlying mechanisms were to result in the long-awaited melt-up - now GME was conveniently fixed at this share price. In a few days, the green fire would be lit by the same players who had tried to put it out.

The timing held another possibility (**SPECULATION WARNING**). If Credit Suisse (UBS) had bought LEAPS that offset their short position from June 30, 2021, they would expire on September 30 - and October 1 was 110 days after June 13… If this short position (70% of GME) suddenly became a red number in UBS's accounts, they risked a margin call. This would start a cycle of FTDs, which (according to DTCC's rules) could be postponed until **13th of January 2025**. After that, the position would be closed by the deadline of **January 27**. It was both striking that three cycles after October 14 hit January 27 and that 110 days after September 30 would be in the middle of the forced shutdown… All FTDs from the cycles Gill had started would hit at the same time.

The theory was supported by a cryptic message - on September 13, exactly 4 months after Gill sent the first of his 110 memes, his brother posted a picture online with the text ""Midway"". After another 4 months it would be 13th of January 2025 - when UBS's final margin call (*presumably*) would arrive... The numbers matched - the explosion emoji had a possible cut off date:

Both ""35"" and ""110"" seemed important - and not only for GME. Gills Chewy shares from July 1 started a cycle that coincided with the crash on August 5, the effect of which was delayed until September 9 and then until October 14 - exactly 110 days after Gills Chewy calls from June 24. On July 31, ""someone"" had bought Sirius calls expiring on September 9, and 35 days thereafter would be October 14. From this date the two cycles would be in sync. After another cycle of FTDs ended up on November 18 which was 110 days after July 31… Sirius had had tons of FTDs in June and July and Gill took advantage. His ""shuffle"" had (*presumably*) been to trick the algorithms into starting cycles in Chewy and Sirius, which would eventually connect - and hit GME at the most critical time.

Gill was obviously exploiting a set of complex rules that few understood to manipulate a corrupt system that was controlled by (near) unstoppable algorithms. Algorithms that were introduced decades ago by e.g. Citadel LLC and BlackRock, and who now steered their masters towards doom:

# The masterpiece - Power to the Players

After January 28, 2021, when the buy button was removed, corrupt players such as Citadel Securities, Virtu, G1, Jane Street, UBS and Interactive Brokers had used e.g. dark pools, OTC, FTDs, ETFs, swaps and LEAPS to hide their naked shorting. When GME was around $10, LEAPS were opened which supported huge swaps. After 39 months, these LEAPS were expiring and the algorithms had brought GME down to $10 again, hiding the problem again. Along the way, 200,000 private investors held on with ""diamond hands"". One private investor in particular knew all the rules of the game and his masterpiece would be to use the hubris of the corrupt players against them. By buying a large amount of stocks and calls at this critical time, he fixed GME at a ""too high"" share price and caught the broker E-Trade and the market maker Wolverine in their own web. It started two cycles of FTDs, which (in usual hubris) were delayed as long as possible and ended up hitting the trading chain simultaneously - just before the LEAPS that (*presumably*) carried UBS's insurmountable short position would expire. An inevitable domino collapse was set in motion. As a savvy film director, Gill had entertained his audience with cryptic omens that came true with improbable accuracy. Behind the scenes, Gill passively watched a series of pieces topple over in slow motion - at the end of which was a firing button. The rocket, which was ready to take ""GME to the Moon"", was filled with fuel from decades of market manipulation. Gill was not a time traveler but a space traveler ahead of his time.

According to Gensler, everyone was free to talk about and buy shares. Gill had simply bought and held a manipulated stock. The corrupt links in the trade chain had lined up the pieces for their own domino collapse, which would (*presumably*) reach its inevitable climax in January 2025 - ""dumb money"".

In a few years, Gill had turned $50,000 into a billion. He could have lived in peace and luxury, but chose again (and again) to bet everything on GME. Gill was truly transformed from the private investor Roaring Kitty into his ""diamond hands"" alter ego DeepFuckingValue. This living legend inspired a global movement of individual investors to break with tradition and hold on to their stocks to defy the established, corrupt system - ""Power to the Players"".

When Gill would choose to go ""all in"", thousands of private investors would follow suit and force market makers to hedge calls, which were converted into shares, which raised the share price, so that even higher calls had to be hedged - a so-called gamma squeeze. Combined with a short squeeze, it would bring down all the corrupt (naked) links in the trade chain in one fell swoop:

# Outro (another prediction)

It was known that the sales of 120 million shares in May and June had hardly increased the 10 largest institutions' long positions - the shares had probably moved to close short positions and postpone FTDs. Samples from 2021 had shown that there were over 6 times too many shares in play, so even if GameStop sold its remaining stock of approx. 570 million shares, there would be naked short sellers left. MOASS could easily make GameStop one of the world's richest companies, and if Cohen then issued a cash dividend, the short sellers would have to pay the investors - for every single (phantom) share:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1evk2tv/update\_what\_happened\_to\_the\_120\_million\_shares/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1evk2tv/update_what_happened_to_the_120_million_shares/)

At the same time as there was speculation about how ""January 2021"" would repeat itself, another time parallel unfolded. On June 21, 2007, the Japanese Yen peaked, and 110 days later the ""S&P 500"" index peaked... After this, the market began to crash, and the bottom was only hit in March 2009 - after a fall of over 50%. In 2024, on July 2, the Yen peaked again, and 35 days later the Japanese crash hit... The price trend continued to mirror 2007, and if the trend continued, the ""S&P 500"" index would peak on **October 20, 2024,** (110 days later) and predict a new global economic crisis. Was the ""110 days"" a predictable fixed point for the algorithms? Was that the secret ingredient in Gill's masterpiece? Regardless, many innocents would soon lose their savings and housing in the process - ""Don't dance"":

[Update: My key stealing crazy MIL passed away. And it's kinda my fault](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/K0bSr1kzAh)  **June 10, 2024**


I have decided I will no longer be referring to my soon to be ex-wife as Wifey. Even that feels wrong now. So I'll just be saying STBEXW instead. 

A few months ago I anonymously reported my MIL as a serious hoarder. Someone here commented I should report my MIL's hoarding to the Fire Marshal, and at the time I decided to do it because I was angry and wanted to get back at her for stealing my collection from me, and making my life hell. MIL had been building a hoard in her house since my wife was a teenager. The house was filled nearly to the brim with rotten garbage, and was rodent infested. I've actually seen rats there. I made a call to the city from a number I googled. 

At first I thought nothing came of it as weeks went by. But I guess someone looked into it, because MIL's house was given an inspection. The house was found to be in even worse shape than I thought. It was not only a serious fire hazard to itself and everything around it, and rodent infested. There were also some exposed electrical wires, a roof leak that's gone unfixed for years that caused bad rot damage and black mold. The outside of the house didn't look that bad, and it was in a neighborhood full of old houses that looked similar. Which is likely why no one reported it till I did. 

My STBEXW figured out it was me who reported her mother, what with the timing and all. She came home and ranted to me about all the things her mother told her the inspector found, and how her mother was likely to lose her house now. But it was only a matter of time before something like that happened. If I didn't report her mother, someone else eventually would have. STBEX screamed at me that I was a horrible deceitful person. I asked her if she wanted to be the pot or the kettle, then reminded her of all the reasons why we were separating. 

I ended up losing my cool and ranted at her saying that her enabling of her mother caused this. Her acting like her mother stealing my irreplaceable skeleton key collection I've spent a decade building wasn't important caused this. And her selfish unilateral decision making and bratty behavior ever since we got married caused this. Couples are supposed to make decisions together. Instead she just kept making them for us both without even asking my input. So I made a unilateral decision of my own for once and reported her mother's hoarding. Which needed to be reported anyway because it's a danger to her and the people around her. 

I told STBEXW I was long sick of just sucking it all up all the time and just letting things pass while they acted like I was the bad guy and walked all over me. Her mother would get nothing more from me. And maybe she wouldn't be as crazy once she's no longer living in a house filled with fumes of rotten garbage, rodent excrement, and black freaking mold! STBEXW just walked away sniffling and cursing me. Yeah, I know I went too far. I'd been reduced to being just as petty as her. I made that call because I was angry. But I had no choice but to stand by that decision after I'd done it. 

MIL ended up demanding my STBEXW foot the cost of cleaning and restoring the house. But she couldn't afford it. From what I heard, MIL went off on her with her demands, and told her to get the money any way she could. Even demanding I pay for it since I was the one who reported the house. She even said to sue me. But STBEXW told her it wouldn't work. The house was in exceedingly poor shape. Rotten garbage, exposed wires, roof leaks, rot and black mold. No one should be living in that. 

When STBEXW tried to tell her mother she couldn't afford pay for the house to be cleaned and renovated, her mother actually attacked her like a wild animal. She hit and scratched her multiple times, and tried to pull her hair out. That's when it happened. MIL had a heart attack on the spot. Going ape on her daughter must have triggered it. STBEX called 911 while looking for aspirin in the house. But by the time help had arrived, her mother had expired. 

STBEXW came home with a police officer in tow for some reason, and was absolutely mad screaming at me about what just happened to her mother. She said this was all my fault. And in all of her ranting, I found out her mother had a weak heart. It's the real reason why she was on disability. The officer had to separate STBEXW from me, and she fell onto the couch sobbing. I hated MIL with a passion. But I wasn't trying to end her life! I still feel great guilt over this. 

From what the police officer said, and from what my STBEXW said, I pieced the story together, and later typed it out. But just couldn't bring myself to post it. I was still wracked with guilt. And just had to take a serious break from Reddit. 

That evening when I found out my MIL had passed away, STBEXW managed to calm down long enough to speak to the police officer more clearly about what happened. But she also kept shifting between blaming herself and blaming me. I asked her from across the room why I was never told about her mother's heart condition. And she yelled it was none of my damn business. But it explains why MIL used to dramatically put her hand on her chest and cry so many times when she wasn't getting her way. 

My STBEXW ended up going crazy in the bathroom she'd been using since we started sleeping separately. She asked the police officer for a moment to herself, then just went crazy after shutting the door. She came out a few minutes later looking angry, but calm. Then told me I was cleaning that mess up. She packed her bags again, and left the house for the motel once more, and told me she wouldn't be coming back unless it was to get her stuff. 

I was so guilt ridden that I was hardly able to function for days back then, and had to take leave from work because of stress migraines. I basically spent three days on the couch hopped up on meds. But after that I got my ass in gear again. My friends all tell me it wasn't not my fault. I didn't know, and MIL was crazy. Either way what's done is done. And I have to live with it. Sadly there's more that happened, which I'll be telling in another post. 

[Update to key stealing MIL saga. My STBEXW tried to defame me. Backfired badly](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/lAbA9fYt0W)  **June 13, 2024**


To the people here who kept telling me not to divorce, that my wife loved me, etc. Y'all couldn't have been more wrong. I couldn't even tell who amongst you were trolls, or just naive fools. Some even brought religion into it. I could care less about someone's religious views on divorce. They are not me. They are not living my life. I remember an old example of a rich man saying he knows how hard it is to pay for gas when he drives a million dollar car. He can't know the struggle of paying for gas when he has enough wealth to buy an obscenely expensive automobile. In the same way someone can't claim to know whether or not my STBEXW loved me just because. They didn't live with her or MIL. They did not suffer at their hands. So they don't have valid reasons so say they knew better. 

I also apologize for the length of this post. But there's a lot to say. 

Edit: Just wanted to make sure everyone reading knows this all happened months ago. I did that a break from Reddit for some time. 

My STBEXW pretty much admitted to my face that she only married me for the financial security. So yeah, I was exactly right. She spent years grooming me so she could trap me in marriage and walk all over me. And yes, she did have plans to babytrap me as well after I initiated divorce. I've confirmed this. But she dropped any act of wanting to save the marriage after her mother died. 

In my last post, I told how I reported my MIL's hoarding, and her house was inspected and scheduled to be condemned. She demanded my STBEXW pay for the house to be fixed. But when STBEXW said she couldn't pay, her mother went ape on her and then died from a heart attack soon after. She had a congenital heart condition I was completely unaware of till after she had kicked the bucket. I was told for years she was on disability only for mental problems. But she actually had a weak heart. Her potentially being removed from the only home she'd lived in for decades put her stress over the edge, and her heart gave out when she attacked her own daughter for being unable to fund her home restoration. Yes I do still feel guilty about what happened. But it's in the past now. 

MIL's house was torn down. Not sure when. But about a week before making my previous post, I drove over to where her house was, and there's nothing but an empty lot now. The house was likely declared a biohazard or something. Not sure if my STBEXW owns the property now, or if it was sold. I don't know. I can't imagine my STBEXW inherited much of anything good from her mother's hoarder den. That house was so bad, I'd even seen a rat scurry by across the top of the hoard once. 

Many past commenters were exactly right about my STBEXW was likely aiming at trying to babytrap me with her love-bombing behavior. A few days after she'd left to the motel when her mother died, I went into the bathroom she tore up to clean it. She'd left it in quite bit of a state the day she left by having a meltdown in there. But thankfully nothing but her personal items were broken. She did splatter shampoo all over the walls though. 

While cleaning I looked in the waste basket and noticed a bottle of pills with ""Fertility Support"" written on the label. When I removed the cap from the bottle, the paper seal had been torn out. I googled this stuff, and it was a common female fertility vitamin that anyone could buy online or in store, not prescription. I confronted my STBEXW when she came to get some more of her stuff. She admitted that she'd hoped to get pregnant so I wouldn't divorce her. But that was before her mother died. After that she said she'd never want to touch me again. And she scoffed when I said I'd felt that way towards her for a while before she did me. I never found out if my ex put anything in the food or open beer she'd tried to serve me though. I searched the house top to bottom for anything else that might have been a clue, and came up with nothing. So she may have just wanted to get me drunk. I can't express enough though how glad I am that I didn't have a child with this woman. 

I wasn't allowed to MIL's funeral. Though I didn't really want to go, my STBEXW specifically told me she didn't want me there. And I responded that I understood why. But then later STBEXW posted online that she was furious barely anyone from her family showed up. Not even her father came. And then she lied by saying I was invited, but refused to come. Which was blatantly false. And I had screenshots of our texts proving it. 

When my STBEXW left the house after her mother died, she went back to the motel for an extended stay while she moved her stuff out bit by bit. Either to storage, or a friend's place. I don't know since I didn't help. I heard from friends she eventually found a studio apartment. But hated living in such a small space after previously having a house. She was also seen looking miserable at the local laundromat. Our former landlord agreed to keep the extra furniture neither of us could take, as his new incoming renters were happy to use them. A lot of you thought she would. But my STBEXW did not try to sabotage the house in any way other than her bathroom tantrum. But she stubbornly refused to help pay for a cleaning service. She made it more than obvious she was doing that to spite me. So rather than wasting time fighting with her about it, I hired a cleaning crew myself. They and I left that house spotless. And I got back my half of the security deposit without issue. 

I did later buy a used Kent Ridgeland bike, and started riding again. The bike had a replacement seat, but is otherwise bone stock original. I only a ride little at a time these days. Currently once or twice a week at most. I just don't have the passion for it I used to. But I do enjoy my short cruises around town. And while I could commute to work on the bike, the surprising amount of warnings I got from people here telling me that's a bad idea made me reconsider doing it. Didn't help that I found out that some friend of a friend got hit by a car while on his bike a couple of months ago. So I'm just hobby riding instead of commuting. My best friend joins me sometimes too. He's got a red Mongoose MTB he dusted off. It needed tires, so I put some on for him and gave the bike a tune-up. And then we took to the bike paths. His bike has gears, but is also much heavier. Mine's a single speed but fairly nimble. So it kinda evens out. 

After her mother's funeral, my STBEXW went into full hate-mode. She started badmouthing me on her social media, and told multiple lies about me because she saw me as responsible for what happened to her mother. She claimed I was physically, emotionally, and financially abusive. Which I was not. If anything, she was all that to me. She also played off the value of my skeleton key collection, which she still claimed was worthless. However there was already a fair amount of word spread around through my friends and former mutual friends about what really happened. And they commented on her posts about it to the point she took them down. But I still got messages from angry flying monkeys. The most common thing them saying was that I ended a sick old woman's life over keys. I told them all my side of what happened, and pointed out I had plenty of evidence. Including being told I wasn't invited to the funeral, and showing screenshots of the texts. I was sorry MIL died. But I couldn't have foreseen she'd have a heart attack. And her house was so bad, it was completely unlivable. A select few apologized, most just stopped talking, and a good few persistently called me a liar. So I had to block them. 

I ended up contacting my STBEXW to tell her that I'd file a defamation lawsuit on top of the divorce if she didn't stop making posts about me. Which likely wouldn't bode well for her career. I'd already screen-shotted everything I needed from her profile before she deleted the posts. Well she tried to say I was blackmailing her. But she stopped. Then she played the whole situation off as just being angry in the moment. But her lying was still called out, and she lost all her credibility. She soon shut down her social media entirely, and called me afterward to blame me for it. Then she mocked me and said she was glad I was divorcing her. She told me I'd never satisfied her in bed because I was too vanilla. And she wished she could have gone back to her ex-boyfriend. That one actually stung a bit. 

To clarify though. My STBEXW never cheated on me. Many people figured she did, including my friends. But no. She just spent a lot of time with her mother. I've also spoken to the man who dated her before me. Some of my STBEXW's former friends still were in touch with him, and gave me his number. He told me dumped her because she and her mother treated him the same way they treated me after I married my STBEXW. Which means their playing nice for three years was one hell of a calculated move. I also learned from the guy that he'd found out the guy who dated my STBEXW before him also dumped her for the same reasons. And he was her high school sweetheart. 

I'm afraid there's still more to this, and will make another post soon. I will say though that the divorce is underway, and not going in STBEXW's favor. 

TLDR: I confirmed my STBEXW's scheming to try and babytrap me because I filed for divorce. She also persistently lied about me to others and tried to defame me until it all came crashing down, and now her social media is deleted. I am cycling again. Which has been fun.

[OOP shows 2 pitures of his bike](https://imgur.com/a/4dKB9vt) 

Just thought since I posted pics of some of my Skeleton Key collection a while back, I'd do the same with my bike. 

[Update to key stealing MIL saga. My STBEXW got in contact with my mother that I went NC from a long time ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/5m2AINv06l)  **June 16, 2024**


To clarify since some people didn't know previously, this stuff all happened months ago. Which is why I made three posts so quickly. 

After the social media incident, STBEXW tried one last desperate measure to get back at me, Which was to track down my mother that I was NC with. She probably found her through face book, because I know my mother has an active page there. My STBEXW knew exactly why I'm NC with this woman. I told her for years the things my narcissist mother did to me. But she went to see her anyway. Either she was looking for a replacement maternal figure, or she just did it entirely to spite me. Or maybe even both. Either way we all know she's petty AF. 

Despite being years NC, my mother wasn't far away. I never really moved far from where I was raised. And my STBEXW fed my mother a very embellished sob story. I got a call from a number I didn't recognize, and it turned out to be my mother. First words out of her mouth were **""HOW COULD YOU!!""**. She wouldn't even give me time to speak by just saying **""I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR EXCUSES""**. Then she went on a rant about the lies STBEXW told her. I just ended the call about half-way through said rant, and then blocked the number. I remember thinking to myself at the time **""Just great! The two people I hate most in this world are now banding together!""** 

STBEXW also figured out where I live. I don't know how. But it doesn't really matter anymore. What did matter was she showed up **WITH MY GOD DAMN MOTHER!** This woman was just as bad as I remembered her, except now she has bleach blonde hair. She still dressed as if in denial about her age, and was still judgmental and narcissistic. But the moment she started yelling at me, I snapped and lost it on her and STBEXW. I started ranting about all the stuff STBEXW and her mother had put me through, and how I wasn't surprised that my own crazy mother would side with a toxic liar like her without even questioning what my half of the story was. I ended up ranting about a whole lot of the stuff that happened. And for once, my mother looked damn scared of me, and didn't even try to counter. 

I don't know how long I was ranting at them. It was just wordvomit and yellsplaining to the point I almost mentally checked out while my mouth did the work. But I told my mother all about the things my STBEXW and MIL did to me. About the theft of my collection, about MIL's hoarding and the condition of her house, about how she and STBEXW trapped me in a fake marriage, how STBEXW admitted to trying to babytrap me, and then bringing my own mother over to try and stick it to me. I looked over at STBEXW and said if her big plan was thinking my mother had any power over me, she was even dumber than I thought. And yeah, I ranted about how STBEXW thought my skeleton key collection was worthless. And exactly how and why it wasn't. 

Police eventually showed up because a neighbor had called them. I had a CCTV camera going inside my apartment watching the door. And it saw enough. So there was video proof I never laid a finger on either of them at least. The police broke things up and escorted STBEXW and mother away. The cops thought I was the bad guy at first. A grown man yelling at two cowering women didn't exactly look good. But they took the time to listen to me, and I showed them the camera footage. My mother looked downright scared of the cops, and didn't even want to talk to them. And STBEXW knew exactly what I'd do if she lied to them. So they fessed up as to why they were there. But claimed that giving me a talking to was all they'd intended to do. Riiiiight. And Zeus didn't throw lightning. Oh wait, he did! Who knows what those two would have tried, were it not for the police and my temper. 

No one was arrested. But I made it clear I didn't want my mother or STBEXW coming back. Right after they left, I went to the police station and filled out a report on the incident for a paper trail, in case of future stalking. Even though one of the officers tried to tell me that was too much for the situation when all they did was show up at my door. They also seemed to take offence to my making a report against my mother and STBEXW. I told him that he didn't know those people, and they were relentless narcissists. After making the report, I called up my best friend and told him what happened. He asked if I wanted to go riding to clear my head. And I said yes. And we went out bike riding till our legs were numb. 

The next day I texted my mother from the number she'd called me from, and explained some things in detail. And I even sent screenshots of proof I had on some things. I made sure to do all this in text for two reasons. 1: So I wouldn't have to actually hear her voice. And 2: because I could screenshot all the texts and give them to my lawyer for my divorce case against STBEXW. My mother said STBEXW told her a very different story that I had been abusive in various ways. I told my mother she was free to have a relationship with STBEXW. But I wanted nothing to do with either of them. And I'll call the police if either of them show up at my apartment, or any future one I may be living in ever again. She did not message me back for several days. I also sent messages about what happened to other relatives and asked they be passed around just in case STBEXW went crying to them too. Which I guess she was smart enough not to bother doing, because none of them heard a peep from her. 

STBEXW ended up having a huge fight with my mother, in which my mother kicked her out. My mother finally texted me back and said she wasn't willing to risk staying on STBEXW's side when it meant being dragged into the crossfire. Then she gave me a short sort-of-apology. Which I accepted as good enough, because getting my mother to apologize for anything is like pulling teeth. I stated I still don't want a relationship with her because I know she still defends the way she raised me. She told me she understands, and then said to have a nice life somewhat passive-aggressively. Then I re-blocked the number. 

STBEXW has not yet retained a lawyer for our divorce, then or now. I'm pretty sure she realizes she can't win with all of the evidence I have against her. Every dumb thing she did gave my lawyer more ammunition to work with. She hasn't been fighting back much at all. Not that there's anything to fight over. Our formerly shared bank account and rented house were our only joint assets. But I took my name off the account, and we both moved out of the house. My credit is locked down, I have cameras, and I'm taking no BS from her. I think she may be scared of me now. Not long before I started posting again, she'd moved out of the state too. She apparently got a job transfer, and notified my lawyer she was leaving, and where she was going. But she'll be back whenever she needs to appear in court. So unless something else crazy happens, I won't be needing to update again until after the divorce. 

##**New/Final Update**
*

[Final update to key stealing MIL saga: I have divorced my wife, and she got a last minute Flying Monkey](https://www.reddit.com/u/MyKeysWereStolen/s/HSVk382x7a)  **Sept 20, 2024**

Been a while since I posted. But here's the final scoop.

I am officially single now, as my divorce ended a couple of weeks ago. My ex-wife did try to drag things out a little. And she annoyed me with the help of a last minute flying monkey. Which failed miserably. In fact, I'd say my ex seems pretty broken now. Aside from the fact her mother was not only quite a financial and emotional drain for her when she was still alive, my ex was also heavily dependent on needing her love and validation. In part because her father walked out on them both. Of course giving filial piety to a narcissist is exactly what they want. So my ex made some bad choices. After her mother died, she tried to put me through hell all over again. But it ended up rebounding on her repeatedly.

To basically give everything on that flying monkey in one paragraph. She contacted me in mid August, and woke me up at 7:00 am on a Sunday morning. I answered the phone by reflex, and this FM was quite the diva, if that's an apt description. This final woman went off on me the in a similar way to how my mother did when my ex went crying to her, and basically tried to start an argument with me. She asked if I was ""My name"" first. And then let out an ""MM-HMM!"" when I answered. Then she started accusing me, and followed that up by saying I need Jesus. I was too tired to give a damn, and just hung up and blocked the number. Still ruined my Sunday though. The FM tried to get at me on Social Media next. That was her big mistake. Her account had her name and face on it, which I screen-shotted. I told her I'd file a case for harassment against me if she didn't leave me alone. She promptly shut up and blocked me. I then contacted my ex through text, and told her I don't give a damn what new friends she makes. If she keeps trying to defame me by telling lies about me to people, I'll sue her. I already had the evidence I needed. She surprisingly admitted fault, told me it would not happen again, and that was the end of that.

Back to my divorce, a few months ago a commentor gave me a bit of a fright that the timing of the police when my mother and ex showed up at my door was a little too convenient. And that they might have called them in advance so they'd show up just as I was going off on them. But I had CCTV proving my innocence, and that they had provoked me. Well just in case, I had my lawyer do some digging. And there was thankfully no foul play. So I guess it really was just a neighbor who called the cops. But I still don't know who. That said, if it had been my ex or mother who called, we could have had my lawyer use it as ammo for a false police report. But it didn't matter in the end. My lawyer and I had a nice load of evidence to use in divorce court. Even the last minute flying monkey was added to the pile.

I have still been going to therapy. And I've been told that while my past with my mother, ex-wife and MIL was messed up, I did well despite the circumstances. But I'm having lingering trust issues towards women I just meet that is gonna take time to get better. I'm just fine around female friends and other women I've known for a while. But any new woman I talk to, or even feel attracted to, I also instinctively avoid. My therapist did agree with me that my swearing off marriage for the rest of my life is just fine. And that not everyone needs to do conform to that. But deep inside I'm just instinctively seeing any new woman as bad to avoid getting close. And I have been working on getting better about it.

My ex eventually admitted surrender in divorce court, and ended up transferring out at her job. She moved to another state, and I only saw her in person again at the final divorce hearing. She didn't hire a lawyer for the divorce like I did. Maybe she knew she was screwed already. Or maybe she just couldn't afford it. Her finances weren't nearly as good as mine since she previously gave a lot of money to her mother. In fact, I found out in the divorce that her credit was not good. Not technically in the toilet. But she has debts to pay I wasn't even aware of that went back to before we were married. I don't have specifics on those debts, other than they exist. But my ex admitted she was hoping for my help in paying them off. As in, she was hoping to make me pay them after turning me into her lapdog. But she and her mother poked at my biggest triggers, and I rebelled. And y'all can read my past posts to see what happened. But it's long and messy. Either way she basically gave me and the court even more confirmation she was only married to me for financial security.

My ex mostly avoided insulting me during the divorce hearings. Much less look at me. She tried to act overly scared of me at first, and still claimed her mother was dead because of me. I owned up to reporting MIL's hoarder house, but I could have never imagined she'd have a heart attack. Also, the house was unlivable and a danger to MIL and the people around it. The judge was appalled by all the information on it's condition, which my ex was unable to deny. The judge also saw right through all my ex's manipulation tactics after seeing the stack of information I had on her and her mother. Once called out, she stopped crying, stood up straight, and just looked defeated. But among the stupid tactics she tried, was talking about my bike. I think at that point she was just doing it to drag things out. She told the judge that she just hated bicycles. And as her (now former) husband, I should have supported her by not owning a bike, let alone keeping one so old and beat up in the house. She described my old bike as a rusty thing she threw out because it annoyed her to look at it. Then she looked at me and said that going to the gym should have been enough for me. The judge looked at her like she was an idiot, and told her that the bike was completely irrelevant, and then we moved on from the subject. And then right as the divorce ended, my ex cornered me in the lobby and had to make the bike her final idiotic dig at me, by telling me she hoped I enjoyed my riding my bike, because I obviously enjoyed riding it more than a beautiful woman like her. I told her there were so many things I could say to her in the moment. But I was just done. So I said to stop acting like a child, it was over, and to just leave me alone so we could get on with our lives. She stomped out the door. That was the last time I saw her in person.

We didn't have any real shared assets. The house we used to live in together was rented, we both own our vehicles outright under our own names, we didn't have kids, and we both make about the same amount of money. But I still had the advantage with the recordings, CCTV, bank records, screenshots from social media, texts, the situation of her getting my mother involved, the FM, and other things I've spoken about in these posts. My ex didn't deny anything presented after seeing all the evidence. So in the end she just talked about random things before finally agreeing to an amicable clean split divorce. No alimony, and we just went our separate ways. Someone here also advised me to petition for my ex to change back to her maiden name. Which I did. She agreed to it with no issue. for whatever reason, she called me and we spoke one last time over the phone just last week. She admitted that while she still hates my guts with a passion, she finally realized what her toxic mother had done to her. Not sure how well I believe that. But it doesn't matter anymore now. She said she'd made new friends after moving, and for once was only having to support herself and no one else. I wished her well and that was that. So at least we didn't end on a bad note. Not really a good one either. Just very neutral.

I'm a free man now. And I hope that my next partner that I possibly may have in time won't be like my ex.

OOP fires back at commenters for calling him an idiot for divorcing his wife over keys, having his MIL arrested. Fires back, and doubles down.


[Update: My key stealing crazy MIL passed away. And it's kinda my fault](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/K0bSr1kzAh)  **June 10, 2024**


I have decided I will no longer be referring to my soon to be ex-wife as Wifey. Even that feels wrong now. So I'll just be saying STBEXW instead. 

A few months ago I anonymously reported my MIL as a serious hoarder. Someone here commented I should report my MIL's hoarding to the Fire Marshal, and at the time I decided to do it because I was angry and wanted to get back at her for stealing my collection from me, and making my life hell. MIL had been building a hoard in her house since my wife was a teenager. The house was filled nearly to the brim with rotten garbage, and was rodent infested. I've actually seen rats there. I made a call to the city from a number I googled. 

At first I thought nothing came of it as weeks went by. But I guess someone looked into it, because MIL's house was given an inspection. The house was found to be in even worse shape than I thought. It was not only a serious fire hazard to itself and everything around it, and rodent infested. There were also some exposed electrical wires, a roof leak that's gone unfixed for years that caused bad rot damage and black mold. The outside of the house didn't look that bad, and it was in a neighborhood full of old houses that looked similar. Which is likely why no one reported it till I did. 

My STBEXW figured out it was me who reported her mother, what with the timing and all. She came home and ranted to me about all the things her mother told her the inspector found, and how her mother was likely to lose her house now. But it was only a matter of time before something like that happened. If I didn't report her mother, someone else eventually would have. STBEX screamed at me that I was a horrible deceitful person. I asked her if she wanted to be the pot or the kettle, then reminded her of all the reasons why we were separating. 

I ended up losing my cool and ranted at her saying that her enabling of her mother caused this. Her acting like her mother stealing my irreplaceable skeleton key collection I've spent a decade building wasn't important caused this. And her selfish unilateral decision making and bratty behavior ever since we got married caused this. Couples are supposed to make decisions together. Instead she just kept making them for us both without even asking my input. So I made a unilateral decision of my own for once and reported her mother's hoarding. Which needed to be reported anyway because it's a danger to her and the people around her. 

I told STBEXW I was long sick of just sucking it all up all the time and just letting things pass while they acted like I was the bad guy and walked all over me. Her mother would get nothing more from me. And maybe she wouldn't be as crazy once she's no longer living in a house filled with fumes of rotten garbage, rodent excrement, and black freaking mold! STBEXW just walked away sniffling and cursing me. Yeah, I know I went too far. I'd been reduced to being just as petty as her. I made that call because I was angry. But I had no choice but to stand by that decision after I'd done it. 

MIL ended up demanding my STBEXW foot the cost of cleaning and restoring the house. But she couldn't afford it. From what I heard, MIL went off on her with her demands, and told her to get the money any way she could. Even demanding I pay for it since I was the one who reported the house. She even said to sue me. But STBEXW told her it wouldn't work. The house was in exceedingly poor shape. Rotten garbage, exposed wires, roof leaks, rot and black mold. No one should be living in that. 

When STBEXW tried to tell her mother she couldn't afford pay for the house to be cleaned and renovated, her mother actually attacked her like a wild animal. She hit and scratched her multiple times, and tried to pull her hair out. That's when it happened. MIL had a heart attack on the spot. Going ape on her daughter must have triggered it. STBEX called 911 while looking for aspirin in the house. But by the time help had arrived, her mother had expired. 

STBEXW came home with a police officer in tow for some reason, and was absolutely mad screaming at me about what just happened to her mother. She said this was all my fault. And in all of her ranting, I found out her mother had a weak heart. It's the real reason why she was on disability. The officer had to separate STBEXW from me, and she fell onto the couch sobbing. I hated MIL with a passion. But I wasn't trying to end her life! I still feel great guilt over this. 

From what the police officer said, and from what my STBEXW said, I pieced the story together, and later typed it out. But just couldn't bring myself to post it. I was still wracked with guilt. And just had to take a serious break from Reddit. 

That evening when I found out my MIL had passed away, STBEXW managed to calm down long enough to speak to the police officer more clearly about what happened. But she also kept shifting between blaming herself and blaming me. I asked her from across the room why I was never told about her mother's heart condition. And she yelled it was none of my damn business. But it explains why MIL used to dramatically put her hand on her chest and cry so many times when she wasn't getting her way. 

My STBEXW ended up going crazy in the bathroom she'd been using since we started sleeping separately. She asked the police officer for a moment to herself, then just went crazy after shutting the door. She came out a few minutes later looking angry, but calm. Then told me I was cleaning that mess up. She packed her bags again, and left the house for the motel once more, and told me she wouldn't be coming back unless it was to get her stuff. 

I was so guilt ridden that I was hardly able to function for days back then, and had to take leave from work because of stress migraines. I basically spent three days on the couch hopped up on meds. But after that I got my ass in gear again. My friends all tell me it wasn't not my fault. I didn't know, and MIL was crazy. Either way what's done is done. And I have to live with it. Sadly there's more that happened, which I'll be telling in another post. 

[Update to key stealing MIL saga. My STBEXW tried to defame me. Backfired badly](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/lAbA9fYt0W)  **June 13, 2024**


To the people here who kept telling me not to divorce, that my wife loved me, etc. Y'all couldn't have been more wrong. I couldn't even tell who amongst you were trolls, or just naive fools. Some even brought religion into it. I could care less about someone's religious views on divorce. They are not me. They are not living my life. I remember an old example of a rich man saying he knows how hard it is to pay for gas when he drives a million dollar car. He can't know the struggle of paying for gas when he has enough wealth to buy an obscenely expensive automobile. In the same way someone can't claim to know whether or not my STBEXW loved me just because. They didn't live with her or MIL. They did not suffer at their hands. So they don't have valid reasons so say they knew better. 

I also apologize for the length of this post. But there's a lot to say. 

Edit: Just wanted to make sure everyone reading knows this all happened months ago. I did that a break from Reddit for some time. 

My STBEXW pretty much admitted to my face that she only married me for the financial security. So yeah, I was exactly right. She spent years grooming me so she could trap me in marriage and walk all over me. And yes, she did have plans to babytrap me as well after I initiated divorce. I've confirmed this. But she dropped any act of wanting to save the marriage after her mother died. 

In my last post, I told how I reported my MIL's hoarding, and her house was inspected and scheduled to be condemned. She demanded my STBEXW pay for the house to be fixed. But when STBEXW said she couldn't pay, her mother went ape on her and then died from a heart attack soon after. She had a congenital heart condition I was completely unaware of till after she had kicked the bucket. I was told for years she was on disability only for mental problems. But she actually had a weak heart. Her potentially being removed from the only home she'd lived in for decades put her stress over the edge, and her heart gave out when she attacked her own daughter for being unable to fund her home restoration. Yes I do still feel guilty about what happened. But it's in the past now. 

MIL's house was torn down. Not sure when. But about a week before making my previous post, I drove over to where her house was, and there's nothing but an empty lot now. The house was likely declared a biohazard or something. Not sure if my STBEXW owns the property now, or if it was sold. I don't know. I can't imagine my STBEXW inherited much of anything good from her mother's hoarder den. That house was so bad, I'd even seen a rat scurry by across the top of the hoard once. 

Many past commenters were exactly right about my STBEXW was likely aiming at trying to babytrap me with her love-bombing behavior. A few days after she'd left to the motel when her mother died, I went into the bathroom she tore up to clean it. She'd left it in quite bit of a state the day she left by having a meltdown in there. But thankfully nothing but her personal items were broken. She did splatter shampoo all over the walls though. 

While cleaning I looked in the waste basket and noticed a bottle of pills with ""Fertility Support"" written on the label. When I removed the cap from the bottle, the paper seal had been torn out. I googled this stuff, and it was a common female fertility vitamin that anyone could buy online or in store, not prescription. I confronted my STBEXW when she came to get some more of her stuff. She admitted that she'd hoped to get pregnant so I wouldn't divorce her. But that was before her mother died. After that she said she'd never want to touch me again. And she scoffed when I said I'd felt that way towards her for a while before she did me. I never found out if my ex put anything in the food or open beer she'd tried to serve me though. I searched the house top to bottom for anything else that might have been a clue, and came up with nothing. So she may have just wanted to get me drunk. I can't express enough though how glad I am that I didn't have a child with this woman. 

I wasn't allowed to MIL's funeral. Though I didn't really want to go, my STBEXW specifically told me she didn't want me there. And I responded that I understood why. But then later STBEXW posted online that she was furious barely anyone from her family showed up. Not even her father came. And then she lied by saying I was invited, but refused to come. Which was blatantly false. And I had screenshots of our texts proving it. 

When my STBEXW left the house after her mother died, she went back to the motel for an extended stay while she moved her stuff out bit by bit. Either to storage, or a friend's place. I don't know since I didn't help. I heard from friends she eventually found a studio apartment. But hated living in such a small space after previously having a house. She was also seen looking miserable at the local laundromat. Our former landlord agreed to keep the extra furniture neither of us could take, as his new incoming renters were happy to use them. A lot of you thought she would. But my STBEXW did not try to sabotage the house in any way other than her bathroom tantrum. But she stubbornly refused to help pay for a cleaning service. She made it more than obvious she was doing that to spite me. So rather than wasting time fighting with her about it, I hired a cleaning crew myself. They and I left that house spotless. And I got back my half of the security deposit without issue. 

I did later buy a used Kent Ridgeland bike, and started riding again. The bike had a replacement seat, but is otherwise bone stock original. I only a ride little at a time these days. Currently once or twice a week at most. I just don't have the passion for it I used to. But I do enjoy my short cruises around town. And while I could commute to work on the bike, the surprising amount of warnings I got from people here telling me that's a bad idea made me reconsider doing it. Didn't help that I found out that some friend of a friend got hit by a car while on his bike a couple of months ago. So I'm just hobby riding instead of commuting. My best friend joins me sometimes too. He's got a red Mongoose MTB he dusted off. It needed tires, so I put some on for him and gave the bike a tune-up. And then we took to the bike paths. His bike has gears, but is also much heavier. Mine's a single speed but fairly nimble. So it kinda evens out. 

After her mother's funeral, my STBEXW went into full hate-mode. She started badmouthing me on her social media, and told multiple lies about me because she saw me as responsible for what happened to her mother. She claimed I was physically, emotionally, and financially abusive. Which I was not. If anything, she was all that to me. She also played off the value of my skeleton key collection, which she still claimed was worthless. However there was already a fair amount of word spread around through my friends and former mutual friends about what really happened. And they commented on her posts about it to the point she took them down. But I still got messages from angry flying monkeys. The most common thing them saying was that I ended a sick old woman's life over keys. I told them all my side of what happened, and pointed out I had plenty of evidence. Including being told I wasn't invited to the funeral, and showing screenshots of the texts. I was sorry MIL died. But I couldn't have foreseen she'd have a heart attack. And her house was so bad, it was completely unlivable. A select few apologized, most just stopped talking, and a good few persistently called me a liar. So I had to block them. 

I ended up contacting my STBEXW to tell her that I'd file a defamation lawsuit on top of the divorce if she didn't stop making posts about me. Which likely wouldn't bode well for her career. I'd already screen-shotted everything I needed from her profile before she deleted the posts. Well she tried to say I was blackmailing her. But she stopped. Then she played the whole situation off as just being angry in the moment. But her lying was still called out, and she lost all her credibility. She soon shut down her social media entirely, and called me afterward to blame me for it. Then she mocked me and said she was glad I was divorcing her. She told me I'd never satisfied her in bed because I was too vanilla. And she wished she could have gone back to her ex-boyfriend. That one actually stung a bit. 

To clarify though. My STBEXW never cheated on me. Many people figured she did, including my friends. But no. She just spent a lot of time with her mother. I've also spoken to the man who dated her before me. Some of my STBEXW's former friends still were in touch with him, and gave me his number. He told me dumped her because she and her mother treated him the same way they treated me after I married my STBEXW. Which means their playing nice for three years was one hell of a calculated move. I also learned from the guy that he'd found out the guy who dated my STBEXW before him also dumped her for the same reasons. And he was her high school sweetheart. 

I'm afraid there's still more to this, and will make another post soon. I will say though that the divorce is underway, and not going in STBEXW's favor. 

TLDR: I confirmed my STBEXW's scheming to try and babytrap me because I filed for divorce. She also persistently lied about me to others and tried to defame me until it all came crashing down, and now her social media is deleted. I am cycling again. Which has been fun.

[OOP shows 2 pitures of his bike](https://imgur.com/a/4dKB9vt) 

Just thought since I posted pics of some of my Skeleton Key collection a while back, I'd do the same with my bike. 

[Update to key stealing MIL saga. My STBEXW got in contact with my mother that I went NC from a long time ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/5m2AINv06l)  **June 16, 2024**


To clarify since some people didn't know previously, this stuff all happened months ago. Which is why I made three posts so quickly. 

After the social media incident, STBEXW tried one last desperate measure to get back at me, Which was to track down my mother that I was NC with. She probably found her through face book, because I know my mother has an active page there. My STBEXW knew exactly why I'm NC with this woman. I told her for years the things my narcissist mother did to me. But she went to see her anyway. Either she was looking for a replacement maternal figure, or she just did it entirely to spite me. Or maybe even both. Either way we all know she's petty AF. 

Despite being years NC, my mother wasn't far away. I never really moved far from where I was raised. And my STBEXW fed my mother a very embellished sob story. I got a call from a number I didn't recognize, and it turned out to be my mother. First words out of her mouth were **""HOW COULD YOU!!""**. She wouldn't even give me time to speak by just saying **""I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR EXCUSES""**. Then she went on a rant about the lies STBEXW told her. I just ended the call about half-way through said rant, and then blocked the number. I remember thinking to myself at the time **""Just great! The two people I hate most in this world are now banding together!""** 

STBEXW also figured out where I live. I don't know how. But it doesn't really matter anymore. What did matter was she showed up **WITH MY GOD DAMN MOTHER!** This woman was just as bad as I remembered her, except now she has bleach blonde hair. She still dressed as if in denial about her age, and was still judgmental and narcissistic. But the moment she started yelling at me, I snapped and lost it on her and STBEXW. I started ranting about all the stuff STBEXW and her mother had put me through, and how I wasn't surprised that my own crazy mother would side with a toxic liar like her without even questioning what my half of the story was. I ended up ranting about a whole lot of the stuff that happened. And for once, my mother looked damn scared of me, and didn't even try to counter. 

I don't know how long I was ranting at them. It was just wordvomit and yellsplaining to the point I almost mentally checked out while my mouth did the work. But I told my mother all about the things my STBEXW and MIL did to me. About the theft of my collection, about MIL's hoarding and the condition of her house, about how she and STBEXW trapped me in a fake marriage, how STBEXW admitted to trying to babytrap me, and then bringing my own mother over to try and stick it to me. I looked over at STBEXW and said if her big plan was thinking my mother had any power over me, she was even dumber than I thought. And yeah, I ranted about how STBEXW thought my skeleton key collection was worthless. And exactly how and why it wasn't. 

Police eventually showed up because a neighbor had called them. I had a CCTV camera going inside my apartment watching the door. And it saw enough. So there was video proof I never laid a finger on either of them at least. The police broke things up and escorted STBEXW and mother away. The cops thought I was the bad guy at first. A grown man yelling at two cowering women didn't exactly look good. But they took the time to listen to me, and I showed them the camera footage. My mother looked downright scared of the cops, and didn't even want to talk to them. And STBEXW knew exactly what I'd do if she lied to them. So they fessed up as to why they were there. But claimed that giving me a talking to was all they'd intended to do. Riiiiight. And Zeus didn't throw lightning. Oh wait, he did! Who knows what those two would have tried, were it not for the police and my temper. 

No one was arrested. But I made it clear I didn't want my mother or STBEXW coming back. Right after they left, I went to the police station and filled out a report on the incident for a paper trail, in case of future stalking. Even though one of the officers tried to tell me that was too much for the situation when all they did was show up at my door. They also seemed to take offence to my making a report against my mother and STBEXW. I told him that he didn't know those people, and they were relentless narcissists. After making the report, I called up my best friend and told him what happened. He asked if I wanted to go riding to clear my head. And I said yes. And we went out bike riding till our legs were numb. 

The next day I texted my mother from the number she'd called me from, and explained some things in detail. And I even sent screenshots of proof I had on some things. I made sure to do all this in text for two reasons. 1: So I wouldn't have to actually hear her voice. And 2: because I could screenshot all the texts and give them to my lawyer for my divorce case against STBEXW. My mother said STBEXW told her a very different story that I had been abusive in various ways. I told my mother she was free to have a relationship with STBEXW. But I wanted nothing to do with either of them. And I'll call the police if either of them show up at my apartment, or any future one I may be living in ever again. She did not message me back for several days. I also sent messages about what happened to other relatives and asked they be passed around just in case STBEXW went crying to them too. Which I guess she was smart enough not to bother doing, because none of them heard a peep from her. 

STBEXW ended up having a huge fight with my mother, in which my mother kicked her out. My mother finally texted me back and said she wasn't willing to risk staying on STBEXW's side when it meant being dragged into the crossfire. Then she gave me a short sort-of-apology. Which I accepted as good enough, because getting my mother to apologize for anything is like pulling teeth. I stated I still don't want a relationship with her because I know she still defends the way she raised me. She told me she understands, and then said to have a nice life somewhat passive-aggressively. Then I re-blocked the number. 

STBEXW has not yet retained a lawyer for our divorce, then or now. I'm pretty sure she realizes she can't win with all of the evidence I have against her. Every dumb thing she did gave my lawyer more ammunition to work with. She hasn't been fighting back much at all. Not that there's anything to fight over. Our formerly shared bank account and rented house were our only joint assets. But I took my name off the account, and we both moved out of the house. My credit is locked down, I have cameras, and I'm taking no BS from her. I think she may be scared of me now. Not long before I started posting again, she'd moved out of the state too. She apparently got a job transfer, and notified my lawyer she was leaving, and where she was going. But she'll be back whenever she needs to appear in court. So unless something else crazy happens, I won't be needing to update again until after the divorce. 

##**New/Final Update**

[Final update to key stealing MIL saga: I have divorced my wife, and she got a last minute Flying Monkey](https://www.reddit.com/u/MyKeysWereStolen/s/HSVk382x7a)  **Sept 20, 2024**

Been a while since I posted. But here's the final scoop.

I am officially single now, as my divorce ended a couple of weeks ago. My ex-wife did try to drag things out a little. And she annoyed me with the help of a last minute flying monkey. Which failed miserably. In fact, I'd say my ex seems pretty broken now. Aside from the fact her mother was not only quite a financial and emotional drain for her when she was still alive, my ex was also heavily dependent on needing her love and validation. In part because her father walked out on them both. Of course giving filial piety to a narcissist is exactly what they want. So my ex made some bad choices. After her mother died, she tried to put me through hell all over again. But it ended up rebounding on her repeatedly.

To basically give everything on that flying monkey in one paragraph. She contacted me in mid August, and woke me up at 7:00 am on a Sunday morning. I answered the phone by reflex, and this FM was quite the diva, if that's an apt description. This final woman went off on me the in a similar way to how my mother did when my ex went crying to her, and basically tried to start an argument with me. She asked if I was ""My name"" first. And then let out an ""MM-HMM!"" when I answered. Then she started accusing me, and followed that up by saying I need Jesus. I was too tired to give a damn, and just hung up and blocked the number. Still ruined my Sunday though. The FM tried to get at me on Social Media next. That was her big mistake. Her account had her name and face on it, which I screen-shotted. I told her I'd file a case for harassment against me if she didn't leave me alone. She promptly shut up and blocked me. I then contacted my ex through text, and told her I don't give a damn what new friends she makes. If she keeps trying to defame me by telling lies about me to people, I'll sue her. I already had the evidence I needed. She surprisingly admitted fault, told me it would not happen again, and that was the end of that.

Back to my divorce, a few months ago a commentor gave me a bit of a fright that the timing of the police when my mother and ex showed up at my door was a little too convenient. And that they might have called them in advance so they'd show up just as I was going off on them. But I had CCTV proving my innocence, and that they had provoked me. Well just in case, I had my lawyer do some digging. And there was thankfully no foul play. So I guess it really was just a neighbor who called the cops. But I still don't know who. That said, if it had been my ex or mother who called, we could have had my lawyer use it as ammo for a false police report. But it didn't matter in the end. My lawyer and I had a nice load of evidence to use in divorce court. Even the last minute flying monkey was added to the pile.

I have still been going to therapy. And I've been told that while my past with my mother, ex-wife and MIL was messed up, I did well despite the circumstances. But I'm having lingering trust issues towards women I just meet that is gonna take time to get better. I'm just fine around female friends and other women I've known for a while. But any new woman I talk to, or even feel attracted to, I also instinctively avoid. My therapist did agree with me that my swearing off marriage for the rest of my life is just fine. And that not everyone needs to do conform to that. But deep inside I'm just instinctively seeing any new woman as bad to avoid getting close. And I have been working on getting better about it.

My ex eventually admitted surrender in divorce court, and ended up transferring out at her job. She moved to another state, and I only saw her in person again at the final divorce hearing. She didn't hire a lawyer for the divorce like I did. Maybe she knew she was screwed already. Or maybe she just couldn't afford it. Her finances weren't nearly as good as mine since she previously gave a lot of money to her mother. In fact, I found out in the divorce that her credit was not good. Not technically in the toilet. But she has debts to pay I wasn't even aware of that went back to before we were married. I don't have specifics on those debts, other than they exist. But my ex admitted she was hoping for my help in paying them off. As in, she was hoping to make me pay them after turning me into her lapdog. But she and her mother poked at my biggest triggers, and I rebelled. And y'all can read my past posts to see what happened. But it's long and messy. Either way she basically gave me and the court even more confirmation she was only married to me for financial security.

My ex mostly avoided insulting me during the divorce hearings. Much less look at me. She tried to act overly scared of me at first, and still claimed her mother was dead because of me. I owned up to reporting MIL's hoarder house, but I could have never imagined she'd have a heart attack. Also, the house was unlivable and a danger to MIL and the people around it. The judge was appalled by all the information on it's condition, which my ex was unable to deny. The judge also saw right through all my ex's manipulation tactics after seeing the stack of information I had on her and her mother. Once called out, she stopped crying, stood up straight, and just looked defeated. But among the stupid tactics she tried, was talking about my bike. I think at that point she was just doing it to drag things out. She told the judge that she just hated bicycles. And as her (now former) husband, I should have supported her by not owning a bike, let alone keeping one so old and beat up in the house. She described my old bike as a rusty thing she threw out because it annoyed her to look at it. Then she looked at me and said that going to the gym should have been enough for me. The judge looked at her like she was an idiot, and told her that the bike was completely irrelevant, and then we moved on from the subject. And then right as the divorce ended, my ex cornered me in the lobby and had to make the bike her final idiotic dig at me, by telling me she hoped I enjoyed my riding my bike, because I obviously enjoyed riding it more than a beautiful woman like her. I told her there were so many things I could say to her in the moment. But I was just done. So I said to stop acting like a child, it was over, and to just leave me alone so we could get on with our lives. She stomped out the door. That was the last time I saw her in person.

We didn't have any real shared assets. The house we used to live in together was rented, we both own our vehicles outright under our own names, we didn't have kids, and we both make about the same amount of money. But I still had the advantage with the recordings, CCTV, bank records, screenshots from social media, texts, the situation of her getting my mother involved, the FM, and other things I've spoken about in these posts. My ex didn't deny anything presented after seeing all the evidence. So in the end she just talked about random things before finally agreeing to an amicable clean split divorce. No alimony, and we just went our separate ways. Someone here also advised me to petition for my ex to change back to her maiden name. Which I did. She agreed to it with no issue. for whatever reason, she called me and we spoke one last time over the phone just last week. She admitted that while she still hates my guts with a passion, she finally realized what her toxic mother had done to her. Not sure how well I believe that. But it doesn't matter anymore now. She said she'd made new friends after moving, and for once was only having to support herself and no one else. I wished her well and that was that. So at least we didn't end on a bad note. Not really a good one either. Just very neutral.

I'm a free man now. And I hope that my next partner that I possibly may have in time won't be like my ex.

This Is How Democracy Dies—Unless We Stop It,"This isn’t about Trump. It isn’t about Biden. It isn’t about left vs. right.

This is about powerful elites stripping away your rights—one law at a time, one crisis at a time.

For years, they’ve taken from you:

**YOUR** wages – Costs go up, but your paycheck stays the same.

**YOUR** time – Work harder, longer, and still struggle to make ends meet.

**YOUR** voice – Unions crushed, protests criminalized, truth buried under propaganda.

And now, they expect **YOU** to stay quiet while they take even more.

Trump’s Words Are a Warning **WE** Can’t Ignore

“He who saves his country does not violate any law.”

This isn’t just rhetoric—it’s a test trial for dictatorship.

History’s **WORST** leaders have said the same:

Hitler: “The good of the state stands above the law.”

Mussolini: “Nothing against the state.”

Napoleon: “I am the revolution.”

**THIS** is how it starts. First, they rewrite the law. Then, they label dissent as treason. Finally, they erase opposition entirely.

Trump and his enablers are testing how much they can get away with. If we do **NOTHING**, they will keep pushing until resistance is **IMPOSSIBLE**.

**THEY** Keep Us Fighting Each Other While They Take **EVERYTHING**

**THEY** distract us with culture wars while **THEY** rob us blind.

**THEY** tell you immigrants are the problem—but it’s **CORPORATIONS** that refuse to pay fair wages.

**THEY** tell you social programs are too expensive—but they bail out **BANKS** and **BILLIONAIRES** with **YOUR** tax dollars.

**THEY** tell you workers asking for better conditions are **UNGRATEFUL**—but CEOs make 300x **MORE** than their employees.

Meanwhile, **THEY** buy up housing, kill union efforts, and bury us in debt—keeping **US** too **BUSY**, too **TIRED**, and too **AFRAID** to fight back.

**THEY** will call us traitors for demanding fairness. **THEY** will say we are dangerous for speaking out. But **EVERY** dictatorship starts by **SILENCING** dissent and **CONVINCING** people that obedience is patriotism.

This isn’t about politics. This is about survival.

**THEY** are betting on your silence. **THEY** are counting on your inaction.

Prove them wrong.

**WE** are gathering. **WE** are organizing. **WE** will not be ignored.
