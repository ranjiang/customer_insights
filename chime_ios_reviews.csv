"Chime has been a huge help for me for the past 5-6ish years I believe. I‚Äôve been using them for a while with direct deposit. They are massive help when you are in a tough spot. Not only do they have the Spot Me fee free feature, they have also came out with the My Pay feature, allowing you to borrow a lump sum of your paycheck before pay day! Fee free! You of course have to build up your limit that you are allowed, but nevertheless it is a massive help in tough spot. It‚Äôs absolutely worth building. It did not take me long to max out at all. Another worthy note, you can boost friends in order to raise your Spot Me even higher. It‚Äôs such a great way to mobile bank, and I highly recommend it if you‚Äôre looking into mobile banking. Although there are some features you won‚Äôt get like you would a regular banking account (minimal, such as bigger loans), and VERY RARELY do I come across certain places I cannot use Chime for (because these places do not support it currently) but it‚Äôs still definitely worth using in my opinion. There is always hope for future improvements of course. ‚ò∫Ô∏èI will continue to use Chime, and it will be recommended to anyone that may need it or who are searching. Thank you for having mine and millions of others back, Chime! üòÅüòÅa fat 5 stars for you.",5,2025-03-04 12:44:40
"Chime is just what you would expect out of a bank. You can open a checking and savings account just as you would with any other banking service. One of the main things that stand out to me over other banks is their app UI, it‚Äôs very simple and clean, making it easy to find what your looking for. I absolutely hate that most bank apps have so much stuff on their UI that you can forget where things are. Chime keeps everything neat by keeping what‚Äôs important easy to see and the rest of it under the settings. The SpotMe feature kind of feels like a gimmick. I thought it was cool at first but the main problem with it is that they are turning overwithdrawals into a ‚ÄúI got your back‚Äù feature; almost as if they are encouraging it. The only difference with the SpotMe feature is that you will not be charged a fee for doing so. I personally think it‚Äôs a bad idea because this feature can encourage bad financial decisions, especially because they offer boosts that increases the amount you can overwithdraw. It‚Äôs a nice feature to have when your struggling but it shouldn‚Äôt be encouraged. Also, one of the downsides to it is that you can only use the SpotMe for online purchases but not for paying bills which begs the question, ‚Äúis this really to help you or is it to encourage spending over your balance for things you want?‚Äù. Aside from this feature it‚Äôs a pretty good making service.",4,2022-10-16 19:06:17
"I like Chime for the most part besides the overdraft limit comes in day by day so if you get $500 over draft you technically only get like so much of that overdraft daily starting out it‚Äôs like $25 I been with Chime now for over a year and just now getting $50 a day overdraft limit it‚Äôs just ridiculous. Especially when you need to pay a bill or get groceries. Rather than that easy to use. I didn‚Äôt like a big
Money transaction amount of a dispute that was wrongfully charged for a car that was even fixed Chime denied my dispute when I sent in screenshots of text messages receipts documents thru emails pics and videos for evidence and proof I just paid for services that the car place did not fix at all. I even ask them to give me my money back before contacting my bank they said no that they would have a mechanic take a look at it. They lied about test driving it too I didn‚Äôt get 2 miles down the road before my engine shot to overheating out of nowhere and almost cause even more damage‚Äôs to my vehicle luckily I acted quickly and had to sit for an hour two miles down from the shop to wait for them to bring a tow truck right down the road to bring it back. So future
Reference Chime dispute team my claim of my dispute was black and white with all the proof so the fact my bank who holds my money should protect my money at all cost especially for something that is straight up crooked and that didn‚Äôt receive services that I had paid for!",3,2025-02-05 10:43:53
"I recommend this app to people all the time, but suddenly disqualifying me from SpotMe because I had a couple light checks and just keeping my money has got to go. There shouldn‚Äôt be any qualifying conditions other than receiving a direct deposit OF ANY AMOUNT. Why does two paychecks of $197 mean I‚Äôm less trustworthy than someone who‚Äôs had two paychecks of $201? $4 is the difference between whether or not you‚Äôre certain you‚Äôll get your money? If I get no direct deposits for a while, yeah, sure, do that; but if I‚Äôm getting direct deposits of like $180, I‚Äôm pretty sure that means I can get you back your little $20. How about you just look at monthly income, if you‚Äôre gonna look at anything at all? Demanding every single direct deposit be at least $200 is ludicrous and insane, and it‚Äôs gonna run you out of business. Your credit builder card is an awesome service, and you‚Äôre absolutely my go-to for banking‚Äî don‚Äôt ruin that. You put me in a really difficult position by disqualifying me with no warning‚Äî and before you say ‚Äúyou knew the limit‚Äù, there are no provided guidelines on how many times you can fall below $200; also, I get paid weekly buster. If my checks were biweekly, I‚Äôd qualify, which is just another failing of your qualification system. Take a tip from CashApp, before you start hemorrhaging customers to the competition. No qualifications. Debt collectors exist for a reason.",4,2024-12-07 16:55:46
"Perfectly reasonable and useful app and service. I've used this service for 2 years and rarely see bugs or glitches in the app. Typically my paycheck is deposited on the same day that it is processed by my payroll (2 days before traditional banks). There is no option for joint accounts at this time, but it's very easy to move money to or from another Chime user. The credit builder service is excellent, particularly when used in ""safe"" mode. The app allows you to set out a portion of each deposit for Credit Builder and Savings automatically, which makes setting up auto-pay super easy for recurring bills. Spot me is a nice plus for the occasional overdraft, and the MyPay loan option is useful for tight weeks as long as you budget appropriately around paying it back. Mobile check deposit is easy to use and typically processes quickly (often same-day) unlike other banking apps I have used. 

I deducted one star due to the fact that a not-insignificant amount of other money/budgeting services do not work well with Stride bank, but that is not a reflection of the app. 

Overall, I would recommend this app to people who either do not have any mingled finances but do frequently send money to friends/family and to those who have mingled-but-not-merged finances as it allows easy transfer between users (and non-users) while maintaining an individual account.",4,2024-09-20 13:33:06
"For me, Chime has been the best bank I have ever had. Offering overdraft protection without fees, leaving me the option to tip has been a game changer. I can‚Äôt say how much I appreciate this feature. The customer service is pretty good. They usually get in touch in a timely manner. Again, I appreciate this as well. There have been times that were my mistake. Like a lost debit card. They provided a way for me to still have access to my funds while I waited for my new card. To my knowledge, I think they went above and beyond by not charging for the extra card and sending me my new card quickly-within a few days. The only thing that has changed for me is payday. My payday through employer is Friday but I get paid two days early until recently. It is now only 1 day early. At the time I had all my bills set for the Wednesday so it was a little bit of a mess. I have learned my lesson the hard way. My response was they don‚Äôt hold our pay. So I‚Äôm not sure why this has happened. I don‚Äôt like it but it is what it is. It may seem trivial to some so that‚Äôs it in a nutshell. Overall they are great-customer service is good. No fees is for real. Boost. Overdraft protection. If someone signs up from your referral you both get money. That‚Äôs amazing . Thank you!!",5,2023-09-15 10:43:01
I downloaded chime to use as a secondary bank account to save money for my wedding next year but still have it easily accessible for when we need to use for things like deposits. Thinking in could just transfer the money from my main account (with Northwest bank) into my chime checking account and use the debit card when needed. Wrong! I liked that I could use my debit card from my original account to transfer money instantly. Well I only realized after my first transfer that there was a $200 monthly limit on this AND it was only available for the first few months of my Chime account being opened before it wasn‚Äôt an option at all. Annoying but I can just do a bank to bank transfer which will take a few days but I‚Äôm patient I can wait. Turns out Chime has an error with my personal bank AND the joint account I have with my fianc√© through Citizens Bank. üòë which means the ONLY way to get money into this account it to set up my direct deposit through work which I am not going to do as it‚Äôs not my main account. I should have known that something was off when they pushed SO HARD for me to set up direct deposit during the initial set up process and I‚Äôm sure it was in the fine print somewhere but it was definitely misleading. I assume since Chime is free they get some kind of money when people set up direct deposit with them but I do not feel like it was made clear that the whole account would totally useless unless you use direct deposit with them.,1,2024-04-10 11:48:35
"I have been using Chime for my payroll direct deposit for many years. I have always received my paycheck 2 days early. I really love the Spot Me option, where you can go negative up to a certain amount & Chime will cover you with no fees! You can also send up to 4 other Chime users a $5 ‚Äúboost‚Äù & when you receive one back, you get an extra $5 of Spot Me (up to $20 extra in Spot Me per month). You can send money to anyone with or without a Chime account with no fees by using the ‚ÄúPay Anyone‚Äù feature. The recipient receives an email containing a link where they enter their card details & the funds are instantly available! Chime also offers an Instant Loan, which you pay back in monthly installments. Chime also offers ‚ÄúMy Pay‚Äù, where you can get up to $500 of your paycheck early & you just pay it back with your next direct deposit. The only downfall to My Pay is you are not able to access the entire $500 at one time. Each day, you are able to request a small amount to be deposited into your Chime Checking Account. My Pay does charge a $2 instant fee, which you pay with your next deposit. They do offer a free option, but can take 2-3 days to be deposited into your account. Overall, I highly recommend Chime as an online bank! I just wish they would allow larger My Pay deposits.",4,2025-03-18 17:55:50
I banked with Wells Fargo before which stole money from me and gave me fees that I didn‚Äôt know about they really killed my trust in banks but then I heard about chime and even though I was scared I tried it anyways because I was starting a new job and didn‚Äôt want my checks deposited into Wells Fargo so I with faith downloaded chime about 2 years ago and I can say they I trust them the most I love that they have a credit card to build your credit but they only take the money you put in like a debit card they also have an over draft safety net and you can send an extra 5$ boost to other people and they can do the same for you and if you share chime there is a sign on bonus as well I couldn‚Äôt think of a better bank it is completely built for the people with no fees and makes it super easy to build your credit and I‚Äôm a college student who graduates soon I would like to buy a house so I need to raise my credit score so I pay my phone bill and sometimes tuition payments with my chime credit builder snd minute purchases as well like dollar tree they all count no matter how big or small If your thinking about trying chime MAKE THE JUMP. You have nothing to lose from a former person who didn‚Äôt trust banks they have restored my trust and given me many opportunities,5,2022-10-14 14:54:55
"I‚Äôve been using Chime for years. It gives me great pleasure to pat them on the back and say, ‚ÄúChime is the #1 online banking app/resource out here, hands down no other is as worthy of this pat.‚Äù Over the years of being a Chime member, I have not had one conflict or account issue whatsoever. I truly mean this. Chime has built in programs that are centered around any members association as smooth and stress free, period. Chime also opens opportunities for members with a boat load of perks and incentives. As a matter of fact, Chimes ‚ÄúSpot me‚Äù has saved me, helped me, and, assisted me in tough times. I‚Äôm not payed to share this with you. I‚Äôm telling you what I know and I have been using Chime for quite some time. Do yourself‚Äôs a favor. Sign up and tell me if I‚Äùm wrong. Word of caution, you won‚Äôt be able to because you will appreciate it just as I have for all these years. Thank you to whoever introduced chime to the public, you really make a difference and impact lives. Lastly, chime helps boost your credit score as well. They have features that you can utilize say in paying your phone bill, utilities, mortgage, you name it. Chime verifies it and reports it to all three credit bureau's. You get the benefit of watching your score grow, in real time! Chime is in a class all by itself!!",5,2024-06-03 00:11:20
"i switched to chime because simple bank became bbva. getting my paycheck a couple days early and not being able to overdraft were what drew me. the credit builder account was a surprise to me and i love it. i have poor credit and this is such an easy way to build credit. 

the BEST part of the app for me though is that when i get paid it direct deposits to my credit builder account and i have all my bills taken out of that. so when i get paid i look at what will need to be paid that paycheck and i put fun money in my spending account. it‚Äôs a lifesaver if you‚Äôre prone to dip into bill money. if you overdraft on your spending account, spot me will cover it up to $20 off the bat (tried and true, my friends), and it WILL NOT pull from credit builder or savings. because i live paycheck to paycheck i don‚Äôt really have a savings account, but i do use their round-up feature. you‚Äôll be surprised how quickly you save with it. it‚Äôs really helping me get my financial situation together. 

it can be really hard to find a bank or budgeting app that works well for people who live paycheck to paycheck (makes me feel so dumb that i can‚Äôt budget for a whole month), but CHIME IS IT FOR ME. Seriously, give them a chance. Customer service is great, too.",5,2021-04-14 18:57:36
"I got my tax return check and tried to deposit it through the Chime App. They ask you to write to deposit to time only on the back of the check. I did so and then took pictures of it front and back clear as day and they rejected my check not once but twice. After calling in speaking with a representative twice they were unable to tell me why my check was rejected. I then called back on Monday and asked to speak with a supervisor who told me that they did not have the access to tell me why my check was rejected that I needed to email the chime support. After emailing the Chime support I was told that they could not tell me why my check was rejected. So now I‚Äôm stuck with a check that says to deposit of chime only on it and cannot deposit it with chime or anywhere else. They have ruined my check and failed to give a single reason of why. This banking app clearly does not care about their customers or their money. I will be sure to empty my account with them and delete it. Never will I use chime or suggest anyone to use them ever again. I even asked them where to file a complaint and they will not get back to me, so I leave this review instead in hopes other people won‚Äôt take a chance with their own checks and have the same issue as me.",4,2022-05-16 14:40:41
I‚Äôve been with a lot of banks and I‚Äôve never had somebody tell me that I‚Äôm not able to cancel my cards based on me not knowing the last settled transaction. I recently had my cell phone and wallet stolen so naturally I called to cancel my cards and the customer service guy said that I couldn‚Äôt cancel my cards even though I gave him every piece of information you could think of Social Security name etc. except I didn‚Äôt know that last settled transaction naturally having my phone which is basically my computer and my cards stolen . To make matters worse I couldn‚Äôt even understand what the guy was saying he sounded like he was hung over or some thing but he basically said that I couldn‚Äôt cancel my cards and I just have to let them linger and let them get fraudulent charges charged to them which is exactly what happened. Once I got my phone in the mail I was able to download the app and cancel them I also noticed all the fraudulent charges that happened during the time I was not able to cancel my cards and they haven‚Äôt refunded me for any of them .I emailed them and called multiple times and it‚Äôs just mine blowing that I wasn‚Äôt able to cancel my cards and that the guy on the phone was so inconsiderate and unhelpful there Hass to be a solution I said but apparently not . other than this experience they‚Äôve been pretty good so if you‚Äôre a clumsy like me and lose your stuff I would think twice about this place.,2,2022-01-24 02:39:29
"I have been with Chime for quite some time now and let me tell ya, when I say they are amazing... THEY ARE AMAZING!! I was with a Credit Union for a little while and they told me I was set up with an account that I couldn‚Äôt over draft in... yet every payday I was magically some odd amount in the negative. It NEVER failed! Then, I decided to give Chime a chance and see what happened. NOT ONLY do they not charge fees but they have this really cool setting that makes it SUPER easy to
save called ‚ÄúRound Up‚Äù and basically what that does is every time you add money to your account it saves a percentage of that amount. Which is BEYOND helpful. It does the same when you spend money as well, except, it rounds up to the next dollar amount I believe.  Their customer support via Phone/Email is FANTASTIC! The workers are so sweet and helpful and anytime I‚Äôve had to call they fixed what ever I needed! I‚Äôve only had to call them twice and neither were to complain but to figure out something or get an answer to a question I didn‚Äôt know. 

I‚Äôm not gonna lie, at first I thought it was a scam, or just another ad on FB... but I am honestly SO happy that I switched. If it wasn‚Äôt for them my taxes would‚Äôve already been fully spent and most of it in fees üòÇ I HIGHLY recommend dumping your physical bank and joining Chime. It‚Äôs worth it... I PROMISE!!",5,2020-03-12 07:44:22
"Have accounts with most major banks and Chime has by far been my favorite. Much more convenient, accessible and easy to use. Specifically, Chimes secured credit card (using your OWN money and thus can‚Äôt spend more than you have) has raised my credit score about 25 points since I started using it about 1.5-2 years ago. The app itself is very helpful and easy to navigate, especially compared to Chase or BoA. Features such as bill payment, instant savings transfers, credit builder, ‚ÄúSpot Me,‚Äù easy ATM access, and direct deposit are great options. Depending on your employer, you may also have the opportunity to get your paycheck 2 days earlier than normal. 

The downsides are very minimal; No checks are issued (some jobs require a voided check for DD), there‚Äôs no physical location (it is an online banking app after all) and their customer support isn‚Äôt great but I‚Äôve rarely needed to call them.

Overall, Chime is a great online banking app and it‚Äôs helped me build my credit back up. Even if you already have a bank account with a larger bank, I would still recommend having Chime just in case. ALSO, if you‚Äôre a parent, this app (along with the secured credit builder card) is an amazing way to start building your child‚Äôs credit.",5,2023-07-19 03:56:04
"I‚Äôve had chime for over a year and loved it. However here lately on ‚Äúpay day‚Äù I have sat all day waiting my check to deposit. Sometimes it comes as early as 11am. Others as late at 5pm. Unfortunately today my chime is unable to track my deposit and it‚Äôs not listed under ‚Äúon its way‚Äù. 
Once I have gotten it at as late as 12am which means only 1 day early and that is fine but what is inconvenient is how inaccurate the time slots are and have been for arrival of and now not being able to track my deposit throws me back. A lot of other banks do not associate with online banks. Meaning if someone tried to send money from a credit union to your account for chime. It won‚Äôt work. You can not go directly deposit a  personal check yourself. You have to go to a gas station and jump through hoops. Chime doesn‚Äôt offer loans or grants like real banks. I suggest this for teens who are just starting out however as you age and get a career you shouldn‚Äôt use chime do to all the faults snd it being unreliable. Credit builder is nice but you only build credit. There is no interest with a savings,banking, or credit account as real banks offer. The spot me feature is also nice. However it tends to come and go and only allow access when it wants. 
Planning to switch banks again bc they also do not file disputes as I have had to do over ATM transactions. I still haven‚Äôt gotten my money back from this and it happened in April of 2021",2,2021-11-17 21:02:43
"So I‚Äôve had time I think for roughly around 2 years now as a second bank and man, they are so awesome! Truly and I think this is the first review I‚Äôve ever left on an app in my lifeü§£. And I also bank with navy federal, and I have always been under the impression and still feel to some degree that is the best bank you can have as far as a traditional bank goes because they are fee free and you can get great loans and great discounts but obviously you have to be ex military or have a close family member who is military. Chime I feel is changing the game of banking and just to see the growth and new measures and features they put into the bank and the app itself within these past two years really shows that this bank has a big future, and will change banking forever. I think they will be doing loans as well in the future but for some reason the only bad thing about this bank is that if you try to get a loan through a company, they will not work with you if you use your chime bank, and a few other institutions out there look at Chime as if it‚Äôs one big scam witches truly unfortunate. But I still give it five stars. Because it‚Äôs not their fault I‚Äôm sure that these a holes look at Chime the way they do and don‚Äôt want to work with them.",5,2024-12-05 19:19:58
"I have never worked w a better online bank than Chime! IT‚Äôs security is Top Notch!! I had a company that I have never visited knew nothing about try to take out a payment from my card. It over 100 payment and Chime Notified me immediately! They texted my number and asked me if I had approved that purchase! It was a simple solution: ‚Äúreply yes or no.‚Äù I replied:‚Äù No‚Äù of course & they wouldn‚Äôt allow the company to withdraw the money out of my account, and for that I am very grateful. You have an option to go over on ur account as well and pay it back later! I‚Äôve had to use that a few times. I strongly recommend tipping chime so that feature stays available and in tact! The credit builder card is Amazing it works for itself helping with providing you a credit score you can be proud of! There are no unexpected fees they try charge you!  I have no complaints when it comes to chime! I love it! However, I wish there were more ways to talk to someone w chime or when a person does try to order something using ur number other than u if chime  would offer more details about the transaction purchase and company it was purchased from. That‚Äôs the only thing I can think of that could use some work! Keep up the great work chime!!",5,2023-03-18 15:17:41
I have had this app for a couple years and didn‚Äôt use it too often until recently. Since my first experiences were good I switched over to using it as my full time bank. HUGE MISTAKE! They did everything they could to screw ke over. I was in a bad spot and withdrew my 401k and was sent a US bank check which I cashed using chime. They held it for 6 days making me wait until the following Monday when it was for an emergency! And to top it off I had verification from the issuing bank that the money had already cleared and they had it and were holding it for zero reason! When I attempted to talk to a bank manager or someone who could help they repeated the same couple of cookie cutter customer service line stating they understood and would help just to have nothing change! They told me it is for my own protection even though the money had cleared and there was no more risk involved just needed to pay me! They did not they left my family including 5 year old son sleeping in a car for numerous days! And to top it all off the level 2 person who handled my a complaint basically said have a nice day and disconnected. I was switching over my direct deposit and was positioning to use chime and only chime now I wouldn‚Äôt wish them upon my enemy. If you want your money taken and held so they can illegally use it for quick investments then go for it. If your looking for a quality bank who cares for their customer you won‚Äôt find it here. Horrible!!!!,1,2023-10-28 18:44:40
"My friend has been bragging about this app for months, about how great the spot me is, how she was able to get her credit score up, all sorts of wonderful things. I was a bit surprised when after creating my account I realized I didn‚Äôt use her invite link. I contacted support just minutes after account creation, and although she was wonderful, she was unable to fix the refer a friend and even if I cancelled out the newly created account and made a new one, it‚Äôs all tied to your personal info and there was no way to get her the bonus. I get that may be a lousy reason not to trust a company, but missing the first opportunity Chime had to rectify a simple clerical error only minutes after opening an account is pretty telling of what I have to look forward in the future if I chose to continue business with them. I was only an account holder for approximately 20 minutes before I asked to cancel the account, customer support needs to be empowered to help customers with this or allow new accounts a grace period before their first qualifying direct deposit. Won‚Äôt be returning, and I hope this warns the next would be customer about the level of customer service available at Chime.

Also, the account closure email is a little aggressive seeing as I am the one who asked to close it:
Following a recent review of your Chime Checking Account, we regret to inform you that we have made the decision to end our relationship with you at this time.",1,2022-11-21 03:38:20
"I can‚Äôt began to tell you enough how much I truly appreciate Chime and am blessed to still be a member and have for over 3 years now . I do have a Wells Fargo account as well b/c I need a real bank for my PrizePicks deposits. But other than that I use chime for everything, my savings and direct deposit. My credit score has went up 100+ points with using chine credit builder. Thank you for the creators because so many times I have used the spot me feature and was able to put gas in my car, get food etc. and try to make a way until next pay day!! Chime is definitely an app for the people‚ù§Ô∏è! And does try to support you financially even if in a hardship. I had direct deposit with chime for my job I had been working for 9 months I got laid off & chime gave me a boost of $160 for a month after they noticed my scheduled deposits had stopped. Luckily I was able to obtain another job within a month so I was able to keep my benefits- (let me clarify) ‚Äî> They give you a certain amount of time to set up ur next direct deposit before your spot me goes back to $0 and any boosts.

"I love chime. I prefer this over a bank account any day! No worries of fees and it‚Äôs basically already set up for you as far as online banking that you normally have to set up with a physical bank. I‚Äôve always had issues with fees even weather  I set up the overdraft protection or not. I‚Äôve had issues with every bank I‚Äôve used over the years and then can‚Äôt access large sums of money when I need it. With this app, I easily set up direct deposit, I‚Äôve had a great experience and even got a text instantly when I tried to make an online purchase that turned out to be a scam and they didn‚Äôt allow the transaction until I gave them permission to still make the transaction, giving me the opportunity to look into the site and determine if I still wanted to allow the transaction which saved me from having to dispute things later and be out of the $40 I almost gave to scammers ( not to mention my card info to a scam artist) this app/ card/ online banking has been a breath of fresh air!! 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommended!!! Thanks Chime! I will be telling my friends and family about this. I‚Äôve already talked to a few. Every one needs a chime account. Best decision I‚Äôve made about my finances and wish I knew sooner!",5,2024-10-23 14:38:54
"UPDATE: Are you seriously advertising on my transactions?????????
Now complete with outside advertisements on the front page of the app. It gets worse and worse. To everyone getting their money stolen by Chime I highly advise filing FDIC complaints which you can do online. Update notes aren‚Äôt a place for your bad jokes. The application is mediocre and the developers act like kids. Kids who get to secure access to your accounts. The only reason this app is so highly rated is dumb people rating the service and not the application. So let‚Äôs do that. It‚Äôs not a real bank account and many services won‚Äôt recognize it or it‚Äôs ‚Äúdebit card‚Äù. My card hasn‚Äôt worked right in chip readers 90% of the time and I‚Äôve replaced it multiple times. Credit builder won‚Äôt let you choose any number to move money over. It will only choose large numbers based on a high percentage of your balance. An adult bank should let me make adult choices. A quarter of the app is dedicated to advertisements that are misleadingly presented as tailored offers for you, but rest assured they‚Äôre just ads. If you have to use their slow and confused customer service then expect to bombarded with multiple unsolicited emails acting as if it‚Äôs your duty to rate the service you received and including ramping verbiage about how you still haven‚Äôt fulfilled your responsibility. Sadly they are somehow still better than the major banks and I‚Äôve been too lazy to find a better service so far.",1,2023-04-22 21:25:49
"I never write reviews, but I felt I had to leave one for chime. Chime is hands down the best bank I have ever used personally. You get paid 2 days ahead of normal pay day, I get $200 spot me for free overdraft  which gets taken out of my next paycheck automatically. Most banks charge $35 fees for each time you overdraft(even if the purchase is just for $1). I also just got approved for $150  ‚Äúmy pay‚Äù which is a new feature that‚Äôs basically a cash advance until the next pay check deposits and it gets taken out. I have had a hard time with other banks in the past and with keeping up with all the fees they would charge. I would end up owing them too much and close the account. Never had any issues with chime, actually chime has even helped me build my credit. But for some reason my credit card got taken off of my account. That is one of the only things I could complain about. I don‚Äôt understand what happened with that but yes it did help build my credit at least for the time I had it! Love chime! I will always bank with you & I always tell my friends about chime but always forget to send them the link from my phone to invite them so we both can get $ for them signing up!",5,2024-07-04 00:00:54
"I never usually leave reviews but i feel like chime deserves one. Amazing bank, phenomenal the amount of control they give you to handle your finances unlike most conventional banks where it feels youre at their whim. Chime credit builder absolutely works, helped me build my credit over 100 points in a little less than a year. SpotMe is amazing, never had an issue with it.

That being said I have one complaint: the pending transaction system. To be fair to chime it isn‚Äôt a problem for just them, but I feel its at it‚Äôs worst with them. When it comes to certain refunds/deposits believe me it will take DAYS possibly a week or two before you see that money back in your account. And when you go to support, they just completely forget about you! I put in a ticket to help get the issue solved, and while my agent was great, i did not get the issue resolved, and my support ticket was NEVER followed up on. I wasn‚Äôt asking anything egregious, just wondering after days of waiting when my deposit will be put back on my card because I know it is chime themselves withholding. Nevertheless, i would still recommend chime, fantastic bank, so much better than conventional banking and I will continue being a chime user as long as they are around.",4,2022-08-11 01:46:02
"Had chime for a few years, only had two problem with them so far, hopefully no more problems!! 1st problem I had was my phone number, my phone broke and had to use a backup phone and when it got fix it wouldn‚Äôt let me change my number back and it took months for them to let me change my phone number back, the second problem was with them and Walmart plus. When Walmart don‚Äôt have your stuff they supposed to give you back your money but if you don‚Äôt say anything they will keep it and lie and say it‚Äôs your bank and they only charge for the products they did give you. When you speak to chime they claim Walmart didn‚Äôt charge the first charge before Walmart found out they didn‚Äôt have the products. I made two disputes about it never got my money back nor touched my card until I got my money back. Other than them problems they are okay. When I use my card they always take their money right than and there and only charge $2.50 for using atm. I only came across two companies who don‚Äôt take their money right away which is gerber life & amazon(depending on what you get and the shipping estimate date)and I put them payments on my credit card which I like bc it really do helps with your credit.",5,2022-10-07 13:22:00
"I absolutely love my chime account! I‚Äôve been with chime for years, at least 5-7 years. I‚Äôve always loved it but now I extra love it. They have a ‚Äúcredit builder‚Äù card , you transfer your own money from your checking on to that account and then when you use the credit builder card it reports to the credit bureaus! They also started the ‚Äúspot me‚Äù feature a few years ago where you can basically go in the negative without any type of fee. It gets paid back with your next deposit. You can also round up your transactions and the extra change can be sent to your savings account so you end up accumulating some money with basicaly no effort and you barely notice it . They also recently came out with the boost program. You can send up yo 4 other chime members a $5 spot me boost, so their spot me account allows them to go negative an extra $5! But the very best part is getting paid early! I get paid on Friday at midnight through my work, well everyone else does. I get my check on Wednesday! I had my most recent check around 5pm on Wednesday. Also when the stimulus checks got sent out I got mine super early. I didn‚Äôt even know they had passed the checks until after it hit my account!",5,2021-07-23 23:06:54
"I am not happy with Chime. I have been scammed out of money twice in the last two months and they won‚Äôt even take the time out to see that this place is a scam and repay my money 300 and something dollars is a lot for someone to steal out of your bank account and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre doing enough to help get my money back from these people. I had to send in a picture showing them. The place is a scam and they still won‚Äôt refund my money on September fifth I will be closing this chime account because I do not feel like they do enough when people scam you out of your money. I am so very sure that their investigators get the same information as me and I did not understand how they could not refund my money, not me getting my money back at 2024 it will be close to $400 that I have lost using this banking system. I am on Social Security and once my check is deposited I‚Äôm going to withdraw every penny out and I‚Äôm gonna close the account. I think you‚Äôre investigating team need to go through more courses, so they can understand when a person has been scammed. Quite sure you called the number from this company looked up the name from this company and then August. They just took the money out of my account without my knowledge I think you guys care.
No. Before I close this account, I will be getting in touch with higher people that could actually help me because y‚Äôall don‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt think that you care Cheri is my name I‚Äôll give.",1,2024-08-12 23:35:00
"The world we live in the today they‚Äôre scammers everywhere‚Ä¶literally!! And you would think a bank would help you if you ever came across a situation where you were scammed or your card was stolen right ? I been with chime 4 years probably more and I was a victim of having my card being stolen twice. The first time I really don‚Äôt know how scammers accessed my card but they didn‚Äôt use my physical card because I had it on me when the transactions were coming thru and then I go to the dispute the transaction I get declined!!!! I was heated but I say heck you know what whoever did it may needed the money more than I did so I‚Äôll get over it but however the second time my wallet was stolen and my card used miles away from me and I caught the transactions within the 24 hours I was told to wait until they stop pending then call back even tho it put me in the negatives and the transactions were fresh when I called I waited to call again when they settled which was 3 days later just to get declined again and they said they found no errors‚Ä¶.No errors? You don‚Äôt see an error when you see someone‚Äôs card being used across state lines miles away ? All I‚Äôm going to say is if you like getting paid 2 days early and having free fee overdraft yea chime may be the bank the for you but it‚Äôs always a catch, just don‚Äôt be a victim during the 1st of the month when rent is due and your card is being used in another state or you might be homeless!!!!",1,2022-05-25 14:35:46
"I‚Äôve had chime for over 2 years and loved it tremendously, from the no overdraft fees to early pay day ‚Ä¶ up until this week. I was supposed to get my direct deposit on Tuesday as I always do so I went to check my account and got a notification that my account was locked for ‚Äúsecurity reasons‚Äù no explanation via email or anything. So I email the review team which responded right away & they say I need 2 forms of identification & a piece of mail .. not just any mail .. a bill of some sort , insurance, credit card .. within the past 60 days. Well I just recently moved & have no mail at all but I didn‚Äôt provide mail that just wasn‚Äôt dated  within 60 days. Well they kept emailing me back asking for the mail document after I explained why I couldn‚Äôt provide more recent mail. They closed my review on the day I was supposed to receive my direct deposit causing it to bounce and get sent back to pay roll. So at this point I‚Äôm beyond frustrated because I have bills and a child to take care of. After rambling through my email I find a pdf of my BGE bill. I finally send all the documentation they ask for and they have yet to respond back to me with an update 2 DAYS later. It‚Äôs frustrating and inconvenient because why hasn‚Äôt anyone reached out just as fast as my first time emailing? Once I get in and retrieve my funds I‚Äôll be canceling my chime and getting my direct deposited elsewhere !!! Don‚Äôt use chime for direct deposit.",1,2022-05-19 20:41:53
"Have you ever been charged an overdraft fee ? Just because you went over a dollar and you didn‚Äôt realize and now your bank is like, ‚Äúohh you don‚Äôt have a dollar now we‚Äôre gonna charge you 35$(or more).‚Äù Like who ever thought of that bright idea lol. Here‚Äôs where our buddy‚Äôs at chime come in hand, chime let‚Äôs you set up a ‚Äúspot me‚Äù option for any of us that tend to go over with out looking or if we‚Äôre out here struggling needing some extra dollars before our next pay day. The spot me feature starts with 20$ and it can go up to 100$ based on the your personal account I‚Äôve had mine before at 100$ slowly but surely got back on track financially and is now down to 20$ chime was there for me and has done for me what no other bank has done before. They also just started their credit card account which means you can fix your credit with them, also you can open up a savings account directly through the app. I can continue spoiling chime for you, but that wouldn‚Äôt be fun for you so I‚Äôll let you download it and explore it for yourself. Click that download button and get started today ohh did I mention they pay you 2 days early ? Come join the chime family you won‚Äôt regret it.",5,2020-11-28 00:28:04
"I love chime the app is very user friendly and easy to find everything if you ever have a problem, when I have to call I‚Äôm never on hold longer than 30mins with compared to other call centers that‚Äôs pretty great, I love the credit builder my credit is pretty bad so anything helps!
My issue is it‚Äôs not a full banking service I wish they offered loans or would bring you to websites of banks that will give you a loan not some sketchy site that will blow up your email, same thing with car insurance they have a banner in the app offering to help find a lower rate and to me it isn‚Äôt helpful at all, it just brings you to some sketchy website that seems like it‚Äôs just there to collect your information and then bring you to an actual insurance company‚Äôs website and then email is full of spam 
I would recommend it but just don‚Äôt go through them to check insurance rates or get a loan 
I do love the new feature however that gives gas discount and more built right into the app I was using a third party but hey one less app on my home screen I‚Äôll take it, Spot me is a life saver took finally building a savings and haven‚Äôt really had to use it but still awesome for when you do!!
I would definitely install it and check it out I think it‚Äôs great",4,2024-10-09 08:23:06
"They recently started holding checks for a week before making the funds available. I‚Äôm not talking about a personal check- I receive a regular paper check from a bill-pay service every two weeks and the money is drawn from the source account when the check is issued. If there aren‚Äôt enough funds, the check won‚Äôt be issued. It‚Äôs like a cashier‚Äôs check. Chime used to make the funds available at the end of the next business day but now it‚Äôs a painfully long time for a check like this. I would understand for personal checks but these are like cashier‚Äôs checks and I‚Äôve been depositing them with no problem for years. It was a major hassle when the delay first came into effect and a bunch of my bills could not be paid on time. It‚Äôs a bummer. My card has also been randomly declined in situations when there were enough funds. Both times I was able to withdraw cash from a nearby ATM (with fee) to pay the bill I couldn‚Äôt pay directly with my card, but it would‚Äôve been really annoying if there hadn‚Äôt been an ATM nearby. I called to see why the card was declined and the card services people were unavailable- once at night but the other time at 4 or 5 in the afternoon‚Äî they were already closed for the day. Maybe it was after closing on the east coast?",3,2022-10-12 02:47:39
"I use Chime credit builder constantly and since adopting it have substantially raised my credit score, unlocking opportunities I otherwise never would have had. I also enjoy the luxury of getting paid 2 days earlier than normal pay day. Spot me has also saved my skin on SO many occasions. The seamless integration to Apple Pay was also extremely refreshing from the hoops you normally have to jump through to get other traditional cards on such. 

Cons are few and far between, the main downside being getting charged at most ATMs to withdraw money but luckily I rarely do so that‚Äôs not a deal breaker for me. The other con is not being able to deposit cash without a fee for a vanilla reload at stores, which again isn‚Äôt the worst thing ever for me nor a huge hindrance. If you like having checks, depositing or withdrawing cash, Chime isn‚Äôt the best choice for you but for everyone else, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. I feel the fact that they don‚Äôt charge overdraft fees far outweighs any of the negatives and give it a solid 9.5/10. Really great bank and excellent app design, easy to navigate. Would recommend to anyone. Last mention is the perk of getting $100 for referring people to Chime!",5,2022-10-07 18:04:06
"I‚Äôve had chime for years and never had any complaints until this year. I decided to wire a transfer into fidelity in order to invest in stocks. Chime sent the money to fidelity. When I decided to deposit some money back into chime, I was unable to get my money back. I called Chime and Fidelity multiple times. Fidelity investigated and told me there was an issue with my bank. I called Chime ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù which is not customer service at all. Because they are a neo bank they don‚Äôt have established knowledgeable bank tellers on the phone lines. The first person I called was clueless as to what I was talking about regarding bank wires. The second person asked for the information fidelity provided me about the issue, and let me know that ‚Äúsomeone in a department who handles bank wires‚Äù would be getting back to me via email in 1-3 days. The email never came. It wasn‚Äôt until I did my own digging that I learned Chime does not support bank wires at all, likely due to them being a neo bank. So why was the ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù telling me that there is an entire department dedicated to them? And why did they allow me to wire the money out, but not back in? On top of everything, they changed the numbers on my cards without shipping me new physical ones. I‚Äôve had to ask people to pay for me because my card numbers are invalid. I feel like Chime is a scam.",2,2024-11-17 00:03:04
"All in all its a great way to help build your credit if you have none because of the way that the credit builder card works and the fact theres no hidden fees to worry about. i personally hate spending money i dont feel like i have so this credit card was a great option for me because you can only spend what you put into the secured account and chime doesnt report how much of it you use to credit bureaus like some other banks do, so you can only positively effect your credit. Also, i get paid 2 days early and the user interface is very appealing. the only issue ive had with chime was when i got a new phone and new number and couldnt access my account through the updating your phone number information process. i suppose they flagged it as suspicious activity? im not sure but it did it for days and i was actually getting very frustrated because i no longer had access to my old number. but i called customer service and got it sorted out within 10-15 minutes after an identity verification process. if you run into a security issue such as the one i did, just call the number right away instead of waiting a week like i did.",5,2023-09-21 06:49:02
"Chime had been an essential tool in helping me understand and build credit history. The UI is decent, I feel it could be simplified and easier to use but not even close to terrible. It‚Äôs easy for everyday transactions and there really are no fees. Connects to Apple Pay easily. The only things I have found to be an issue is renting a vehicle, even with the credit builder card, I am not able to rent a vehicle even though Chime claims you can rent a vehicle using their card. The major rental companies consider this a pre-paid card and it is not an acceptable form of payment. I have experienced this the hard way. I also completely disagree with having to pay money to deposit cash at most locations. I realize this is not a fee from Chime but paying to deposit money is just plain wrong and screams corporate greed! Finding a nearby Walgreens is not always possible. Other than those 2 things though, Chime is a great choice for anyone looking for a simple no hassle, no fee debit card. Get the credit builder card to build credit & take advantage of the free credit building service as well. You can view your credit score & report for free, also a great resource for anyone looking to build and establish credit.",4,2023-11-27 12:57:34
"I am giving Chime three stars because it started out great. I got my check two days early, I was able to establish credit with their credit builder feature, and Spot Me is a great feature. However, then they introduced the My Pay feature. It started out as an awesome addition. It really came in handy when needed and although it wasn‚Äôt always accurate on my earnings, it was enough to actually help out. Then all of a sudden they announced it would be going away. This left lots of people in a bind who used the feature. Now it‚Äôs back and totally inaccurate, it‚Äôs basically a higher version of spot me and even though I used it for the whole time previously and all of my direct deposits go into this account, they are only offering small amounts. It does not track you to and from work which accounted for increases in the amount previously. So you basically have to rebuild to the actual $500 they advertise. It‚Äôs not based on your earnings because if it were that means they are only offering 7.5% of my earnings every two weeks. I get for new accounts but existing customers should be eligible if they have a great track records for more. Overall, its a feature that helps and many prepaid accounts do not offer. Just do Not expect more than $100. Otherwise, I am happy with Chime!!!!",3,2024-09-26 18:52:15
"I‚Äôve been with Chime for years now. It was the second bank I‚Äôve ever used. It was awesome in the beginning, I enjoyed the perks like no atm fees and the well designed app. But lately it has gone downhill fast. Starting when they disabled spot me without any notice and at this time I‚Äôve lost my job due to COVID-19. So lately to make ends meet I‚Äôve been making my money through Doordash and instacart and if you do either you know it can be very little amounts you make during certain times of the week. So I had my money transferred into my Chime account, witch was in the negative as it has been a lot lately for me. Well the amount I made witch was only $43 wasn‚Äôt even enough to cover my negative balance, witch wasn‚Äôt an issue because I had spot me. Well since I never got a notification that they had disabled spot me that $43 I had for the next day or two was gone and I went without the things I needed. I contacted Chime and explained my situation for them to only tell me that there was nothing they could do. After about 30 minutes of arguing, I finally gave up because I was getting no where. So I felt useless to my family and they were perfect okay with that. Now we‚Äôre here today, where I need to get the things I need and I cannot access my money yet once again. I‚Äôm just going to cut my loss and go back to the bank I first started with. It‚Äôs just a shame that they treat they‚Äôre loyal customers like this.",2,2020-11-25 15:38:49
"I took out money from my retirement that I desperately needed as I was out of work for a few months. Without knowing the hold requirement, I deposited the check on the mobile app. Only the next day did I find out a 10 day hold was put on my check. A U.S. treasury check!!!!!! If I had went to a teller where I live at PNC, the funds would have been available the next day; however, I deposited it into Chime. My car insurance got cancelled, they are threatening to turn off my electric and take my car, and my landlord is threatening to evict me and I have large deposit of money that I made into my account that could help me not lose everything I have but I can‚Äôt touch it because Chime won‚Äôt make it available to me. Not even a small portion of it‚Ä¶they won‚Äôt give me anything until after 10 days. In the meantime, late fees are adding up and I am getting more and more in debt. Once this hits my account, I am done with Chime forever. What a horrible experience and no type of resolution to help. You talk to a bunch of reps who can‚Äôt take the hold off your check because it‚Äôs through bancorp. Since they are handling our money, we should be able to talk to the people who can access and make changes to our accounts instead of them being able to hide behind Chime so there is no accountability. I‚Äôve never in my life heard of someone holding a U.S. treasury check for 10 days. Pathetic!",1,2023-08-10 18:38:08
"Before I got Chime, I was with BMO Harris Bank for about 2-3 years. It seemed like I was having a new issue every single week; the final straw for me was finding out my account was empty AND overdrawn, just over $50, for a ‚Äúnon-BMO ATM FEE‚Äù, literally with the ADDRESS of the BMO branch that was 2 blocks from the salon I worked at in downtown Chicago. Not to mention that they waited like TWO MONTHS LATER to try & charge me that fee...so I had to comb through all of my bank statements, and even after showing them the mistake was THEIRS, and THREE trips to the branch, it took another MONTH for them to fix it. Chime has literally changed MY LIFE. NO fees, thousands upon thousands of fee-free atm machines, excellent customer service...I can go on & on about how much I love this bank. Best of all is when I got their Credit Builder card, back in January....I‚Äôve been working on my credit for about 2 years now, and as soon as I got the Chime Credit Builder Card, my score jumped up to 106 points on TransUnion and another 48 points on Equifax!!! It gave my credit score an overall boost of over 150 POINTS!!! If you are tired of being scammed by these banks AND want to build your credit up, *CHIME* is THE ONE for you!!! Good Luck! ‚ô•Ô∏è",5,2021-03-15 21:52:55
"So I opened my chime account in 2019, I loved it at first because of the no overdraft fees and the early pay, but this bank is so annoying to deal with. Not only is their customer service horrible but just trying to get in contact with someone is as well. You spend about 10 minutes on the call menu alone just trying to get through the different options to find the right place. My wallet had gotten stolen so i canceled my credit card and debit card, I then requested a new one, took almost a month to get there. Tried to activate it and was told that the card information was wrong. Okay? Not sure how it would be wrong since it's literally right there on the card. So i contacted a rep through the app, they said they would send another one. Got the new card, tried to activate it AND IT STILL WOULD NOT WORK. Okay, maybe it's just a system error. Got a new card AGAIN a few days later after they expedited it. Tried it activating it again and it still would not work. I decided to close my account after that. It was just too much hassle to try and do it over the phone and not be able to just walk into an actual branch to get my issue resolved. Oh and when I went to close my account, the representative didn't even ask why I was closing my account. You would think that such a highly reviewed ""bank"" would atleast want to know why a dedicated customer is closing their account.",2,2021-03-03 20:30:20
"At first I loved chime. I‚Äôd get my check around 5-6 every Wednesday. But for over a year now it‚Äôs been extremely inconsistent with when my check loads. A lot of times recently I don‚Äôt get it til Thursday (which is one day early) and that really messes with me because I go check by check and i need it that Wednesday. It‚Äôs very stressful to not know if my check is going to come or not and when it‚Äôs going to come. They blame my employer yet other people at my job get their checks around the same time same day every week so it doesn‚Äôt make sense. I haven‚Äôt even had an opportunity for my spot me to go up. It doesn‚Äôt tell me anymore what i need to qualify for it to go up. It used to tel lame how much and how many months and then show the amount I‚Äôve made so far and how much more I need for the month. Now nothing shows but the typical explanation of spot me. So why am I not able to raise my spot me all of a sudden? Chime isn‚Äôt helpful. A random $20 came out of my account and they didn‚Äôt do anything about it. 
I‚Äôm switching banks because I can‚Äôt handle the inconsistency of not knowing when I‚Äôll get paid and if it‚Äôll come the day it‚Äôs supposed to. It doesn‚Äôt make sense for it to come Thursday mornings when every other time for like ever it was no problem loading in 2 days early. But now it‚Äôs been terrible. It‚Äôs stressful when you go check by check. So I don‚Äôt recommend if you go check by check every week.",1,2023-04-19 18:03:26
"Your application is awesome. It‚Äôs easy to use and I love the easy access to move money between checking and savings. The only frustration I have with chime is the timing of my direct deposit. The consistency of direct deposits are very good or very bad! Meaning there usually 2 days before payday. Which is very appreciated. Then there‚Äôs the direct deposits that don‚Äôt get posted to my account until I call several days after my payday has come and gone asking customer service when is my direct deposit going to be posted? And I‚Äôm given the same old excuse of we post it when we get it? And then magically after telling customer service the amount of my direct deposit not being posted to my account it magically is posted. The bank I used before I can to chime always posted my direct deposit to my checking account the same time for over 20 yrs! I came to Chime because I learned that my bank was holding my direct deposit for 2 days to make interest off of my paycheck before posting it to my account. But my previous bank always posted my direct deposit on payday for over 20yrs. I love my chime app but loathe your customer service and untimely direct deposits. Honestly if the direct deposits were always timely I would rate your app with five stars.

Sincerely
Scott Stewart",3,2021-04-21 02:18:41
"I have done everything that I have read about the spot me. I have qualified for the $200 spot me 90 days ago and I still have not received my $200 spot me y‚Äôall have received over 15 direct deposits of 2000 to 3400 a month . I have used my checking account and I‚Äôve read the small print on spot me. I have been qualified for the $200 spot mean again over 90 days ago. That is my only reason why I bank with y‚Äôall but I spoke with the lady today she was really nice and I explain to her that if y‚Äôall want to keep my business please raise my spot me before October 25 or you will lose my business. I have done everything y‚Äôall told me to do and I have earned it. And I enjoy having that security blanket my wife I got her hooked up with Chime. Because of me She had her spot with $200. 6 months later. I know I‚Äôm not gonna hurt your business, but that‚Äôs the only reason why I chose y‚Äôall because there was it any fees on your spot me besides the tip and I always tip but that‚Äôs the only reason why I am leaving but thank you so much I‚Äôve enjoyed charm. Y‚Äôall have a really great app. I can send money to my kids my honey. I love all the savings with the change. It‚Äôs awesome. I will miss banking with y‚Äôall.",5,2022-10-06 03:42:49
"*This bank has been really good so far. No fees like it says and I got my card very quickly. Just two issues I have with it so far. One is that they go through Green Dot for cash deposits. Green Dot charges 4.95 and requires a minimum of 20 to deposit. I hope that they eventually make a kiosk or something that eliminates these fees. Also it doesn‚Äôt update your account balance right away. For those of us with bad memory it makes it a little more difficult to budget. I recommend using a notepad app to keep track of your funds until the app updates your account info. It seems to update approximately 3 hours after the transaction. It would be nice to have it be immediate. If they fix these two issues I‚Äôd say it would be a five star service. Another small gripe is that you can only get the no fee overdraft with direct deposit. Though if you budget correctly it‚Äôs not an issue. Just a small quality of life thing. Otherwise I‚Äôd say this bank does everything better than most other banks. 

*My previous rating was three stars but I realized that one of the issues wasn‚Äôt the banks fault but rather the third party company Green Dot‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt like having to pay such large fees just to deposit cash but it‚Äôs Green Dot policy.",4,2020-07-08 23:05:09
"Edit: still so great!

I was nervous about there being no branches and only online but it turned out very smooth. I have both savings options activated and I love it! It takes a bit for the round up though maybe between an hour of the posted transaction to at least 1 business day. But that‚Äôs not too annoying. I DID ask for the emailed direct deposit form and it has the old routing number. It was an easy fix and my 2 most recent deposits have come through perfectly fine. I‚Äôm a huge lover of Apple Pay so I‚Äôm glad it works with that. The mobile check deposit feature works great as well. I received an email the next business day saying my check was received and it‚Äôll be available the next business day. (Good thing I did all of this on a Monday.) You don‚Äôt really feel lost or anything using the app it‚Äôs very simple. I have only had the service for a couple weeks but so far I am a top fan. I took a star away because the routing number issue delayed my first deposit by one day. Also if you use the chat line for service a different rep replies each time. That also makes me worry a bit of a huge issue occurs that you‚Äôd usually go into a branch for. But again so far, it works gloriously!",5,2021-02-06 16:32:02
"I was done with my local credit union. Fee after fee after fee after fee. I blink and I had a fee from that bank. So I decided to try out Chime. I AM HAPPY WITH THAT DECISION. I have NEVER been charged a fee with Chime. They offer spot me. And as you stay with them longer, the spot me increases. So say you thought you had $50 in the bank, but turns out you only had $40. No worries! They will spot you, and you get charged nothing. I don‚Äôt use it often, but when it happens its nice to know I won‚Äôt have to pay an extra $34 or however much these days. And most of the time they send you a notification of your balance every day, except for some reason I haven‚Äôt been getting that lately. I have no issues finding an ATM that won‚Äôt charge me $2-4. My money is deposited 1-2 days early. I actually never had to contact support yet. I been with Chime for a year!!! The only thing is I haven‚Äôt tried depositing money, as thats the only thing that would seem to be a hassle, but I never had to so it may not even be that much of a hassle. 

If you are tired of endless fees, banks who don‚Äôt understand, corporate bank / credit union companies getting any and every little penny out of you, THIS IS THE BANKING APP.",5,2021-09-07 13:45:09
"I have been using Chime for all of my banking needs for several years now. I use the checking account, savings account, and the credit builder account. I was once advised by a realtor that the credit builder account doesn‚Äôt really help that much but it seems to have helped my credit score over the time I have used it. 

I have found that the Chime customer support team is both easy to reach and helpful. They have so many local places where I can load and withdraw money, and I can‚Äôt think of a single issue I have had that wasn‚Äôt quickly resolved. It easily connects to other types of accounts for simple payments and for access to my credit score. I love the boost feature and the spot me feature where I can choose to tip or not tip for the ability to overdraft my account without additional fees if necessary. They even have come out with their own form of daily pay from your job which has almost completely eliminated my need to ever use spot me. I just wish that the MyPay repayments could get reported to the credit bureaus. Thank you Chime for allowing me to have a simple banking experience! I suggest you to anyone who needs a bank account.",5,2024-10-15 15:14:17
"I started using Chime when I started at my new job. I was a bit nervous to utilize a new banking system after being with Wells Fargo since the 90s. Not only did Chime make it extremely easy to set up, but the app assured me that I did not have to leave Wells Fargo right away. Eventually, because Chime has been THAT amazing, I plan on completely migrating over to Chime. But I want to spotlight on the app‚Äôs direct deposit function, because that‚Äôs where this app truly has shined, in my opinion. 

I split my check that I received, and not only has Chime allowed me to still deposit 10% of my split to Savings but I‚Äôm still allowed all the features it has presented, such as Round Up. I am amazed how many lack of limitations that this company has when you‚Äôre a member of their banking system. I‚Äôm not charged for a savings account, nor do I need to have a certain amount to allow interest. Oh! By the way, when they say interest, they absolutely mean it! The interest you receive on your savings is mind boggling. I wouldn‚Äôt say it has the best high yield account I‚Äôve used, but it is great for just a ‚Äústandard‚Äù savings account without the stress of making sure you meet a minimum. 

Great job, Chime!",5,2022-04-08 14:51:15
"I‚Äôve been with Chime for years now. Literally never had a problem. I get my direct deposit 2 days earlier than everyone else. I have a savings, checking, and credit builder. You can connect external accounts and cards flawlessly. Transfer money to non-chins users for FREE (goodbye Venmo with their fees). And my favorite feature is the credit builder card‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs metal, first of all, so it lasts forever- but it works exactly like a debit card, except that your reoccurring monthly payments (if you pay your bills with it) are reported to the credit bureaus and builds your credit! (Just like a credit card; except there are no fees, interest, or minimum credit score required) I was skeptical at first because there‚Äôs no physical bank to walk in, but I‚Äôve never missed it. They have atms everywhere, and I keep my local bank account connected just in case I need a bigger cash withdrawal. It transfers immediately and available. Also, when I changed jobs for a over a year I didn‚Äôt use it‚Ä¶ but they kept my account open and I was able to pick right back up. They also offer discounts to lots of things, and other features, but those are my favorites!!!",5,2024-05-07 08:57:53
"as someone who just turned 18 i was more worried about credit cards and money, and how to deal with it. the things i do enjoy is the credit builder which does a wonderful job at helping your credit each time you pay it back. having a credit card that functions like a debit card helps ease my anxiety about statements due and etc. getting paid two days early is also the plus the only thing id personally like would be the ability to lock my savings from myself as i am a CHRONIC spender and can‚Äôt manage my money like i should. chime does a wonderful job at maintaining your finances and credit. i also enjoy how they will show your bills and how much you‚Äôre paying for them. their concept is a little hard to grasp and they only give spot mes for around 20 bucks: 40 if you have friends with chime but i prefer it that way as so im not over spending my money or next paycheck. very worth it if you‚Äôre just turning to a new credit card or if you‚Äôre looking to open up another one. my credit score my only be low but that‚Äôs only due to the fact my credit history is so small which does make sense since this is my first credit card.",5,2024-03-31 06:57:08
"Chime is flexible, modern, convenient, forward, thinking, app is excellent always being upgraded for functionality. Customer service is awesome fast friendly accurate Chime is about real life. It‚Äôs about being on the go juggling finances the old brick and mortar institutions are highway robbery. I‚Äôm a single father of three every penny counts, I can‚Äôt afford to be paying $35, every time one of my subscriptions or one of the kids buys some thing at the App Store and it throws off my account and I get whacked $130 because of one mistake that my eight-year-old son didn‚Äôt mean to happen he didn‚Äôt know but they don‚Äôt want to hear it. It‚Äôs like they look for ways to cost you more money the Chime overdraft itself funded by the members is excellent, overall I‚Äôve been with Chime since 2019. It‚Äôs been great they steadily upgrade they‚Äôre always looking to do better and I‚Äôve never seen them try to squeeze anything more out of their membership. The only thing I could add that I could see to make it better is if you have a good track record, then your spot me, could be increased incrementally for your years of good banking other than that thank you, Chime",5,2024-10-08 22:45:10
"I absolutely love my Chime Debit card. Looking for ease of convenience they look no future then the Chime Debit card.. Take advantage of getting paid up to 2 days early with Direct Deposit and as an added bonus once Direct Deposit is set up you will access to Chimes Spot me Feature which lets you draw up to $200 of extra money with no additional fees and on your next deposit Chime will automatically deduct it from your paycheck and payback your Spot Me without charging a single cent extra. Also take advantage of the Chime Credit Builder Credit Card as it reports to all major credit bureaus and can significantly increase your Credit Score best of all you decide how much money you want to move from your Chime checking account over to your Chime Credit Card and with the safe credit feature Chime will automatically make your credit card payment on time every month, with the money that you had already moved into the Credit Card account and spent. You do not ever have to worry about missing a credit card payment again or not having enough money to make the payment because Chime does it for you all with no extra charges ever!!!",5,2023-10-14 08:03:20
"In general, I really love Chime. I‚Äôve used it for years. It‚Äôs a great banking app. The only downside is some places don‚Äôt view it as an actual bank and you can‚Äôt use it for certain situations etc.
The layout changes a lot. This last update I am really not liking as it has made it so much more difficult to simply turn your card off and on. It went from clicking one button and it popping up and letting me turn it off/on to now I have to go through multiple different buttons and features to get to my physical card lock option. 
The only other complaint I have is the my pay for example, if I have a limit of $200 for pay advance I shouldn‚Äôt have to sit there and wait‚Ä¶ it will literally be $24 a day and you have to sit there and wait for the full amount‚Ä¶just give your customers access to the full amount at once‚Ä¶it‚Äôs so inconvenient to do it that way and you‚Äôre gonna give me the limit regardless so why make us wait? I understand the aspect that you get two extra bucks anytime someone wants an instant deposit from their my pay, but you could simply raise that if they are trying to get the whole amount at once and you still get the extra money.",4,2024-08-24 05:50:53
"Very happy customer! Even though there is no stand-alone bank, I have had an excellent experience with Chime. 1) I like getting paid early 2) No overdraft fees, love the Spotme feature 3) Ease of use 4) I love that I view my card in the app, it sounds lazy, but I‚Äôm tired of pulling out my card every time I want to buy something online (lol). 5) I love that my mom and I both got $50 when she referred me to sign up for an account. What an awesome referral program for everyone. 6) You can turn your debit card transactions on/off with the click of an app. (I forget to turn it back on sometimes! I‚Äôve embarrassed myself at a store a time or two.)

Also, there are many ATM locations near me that are free of charge. I like that I can ‚Äúround-up‚Äù to save if I‚Äôd like, or set 10% of my direct deposit aside. Chime has been compatible with PayPal and Apple Pay to send money to people. With that being said, I use cash at most restaurants / gas stations / stores, I don‚Äôt like my card number being out there. I had debit card fraud with my old bank account. I have not had that incident happen with chime and I hope that it never does.

Not revenant to the app or bank- but cashiers at the store always say the card is a cute color lol.",5,2019-09-07 20:51:40
"I love using Chime, there are so many good things about it. Chime lets you transfer money to savings or anyone instantly, you have 24/7 access to the app to check your balance and when you purchase something it deducts it automatically from your balance, it automatically transfers money to your savings with every purchase you make which is really helpful with saving, if you‚Äôre ever in a bad situation they will spot you $25 with no charge and every month your friend can send $5 boosts each friend and that adds on to the $25 so that‚Äôs is very useful when in a tight situation (usually around bill time for me), it lets you lock your card if you lost it/left it at home/ are not using it, it lets you have 24/7 access to your card number on the app if you left your card at home or you want to make a purchase online and don‚Äôt want to dig your card out of your purse/wallet, and it lets you receive your paycheck 2 days early. My only complaint is the receiving your paycheck 2 days early, sometimes they are slow on that and I only get 1 day early, but I‚Äôm still getting it early so it‚Äôs not a big problem, just a tiny complaint.",5,2023-01-11 16:15:26
"I turned 18 recently and in an effort to become an adult I decided to go with Chime to help build my credit. The sign up process was incredibly easy and seemed legit, I ended up getting a card and getting access to my account. After a couple of days, I went to the app to transfer money and found that I was not able to log in because my account no longer existed. At first I thought I just dreamed signing up for the app, but that‚Äôs ridiculous because I had the card. I ended up calling support and the lady I talked to informed me that my account was suspended. I had no money in the account and I only had it for a couple of days, in order to lift the suspension I had to send my ID and proof of insurance which would be all fine and dandy if I hadn‚Äôt already put my ID in the app and felt like it was a little sketchy. She said that my account violated a term of their bank but I hadn‚Äôt violated any terms and I wasn‚Äôt even able to close the account because she wasn‚Äôt able to do that for whatever reason. Absolutely upset that now some company that had been recommended to be had screwed me over and took my information, thank god none of my money, but after looking it up I found a lot of people have had this problem. 
100% do not recommend and if you do have it, look into Chime closing accounts for no reason and close your account. Put your money somewhere else.",1,2021-12-11 20:00:11
"I‚Äôve been using Chime for a couple of years. I just don‚Äôt go into a bank anymore. The only reason why I am going to open up a separate account with a brick and mortar is because in the next few years I want to get a decent home loan and usually being a member of the bank will help with that. Other than that this is perfect especially for people that aren‚Äôt ready to make a major purchase yet. I have had issues in the past and they have been resolved quickly and customer support is quick to ask. For those that are having issues with the chatbot, you can just type ‚Äúhuman‚Äù and you can submit something to them and they usually get back to me within less than 12 hours probably about four. There have been times where the system has been down. This is why I‚Äôm removing a star. The system has been down several times in the past year by several I mean like maybe three but that‚Äôs still too many times. I have a credit card as back up. Working in IT myself I can‚Äôt actually be too upset. Things happen. I am prepared.
I would not recommend this for somebody that is old-school but if you never really go into your bank or use checks anymore‚Ä¶ (You CAN send a check from the app and it is mailed) this is for you.",4,2020-12-17 19:57:23
"I‚Äôve loved and raved about my chime service. I thought it was great and worked perfectly for me and my lifestyle as I am a student.  But, I had somebody hack into my card more than once, totally understandable, it happens with banks. The first time took over a year to resolve for $99‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt fight for that amount of money if I didn‚Äôt need it. However, both times it has happened Chime has made it close to impossible to get my money back for charges that that I did not spend or authorize. Last time this happened it was for 3 charges at one time for over $1,000 at Walmart? If I was spending that kind of money myself why would I have 3 different charges increasing in value each time knowing I didn‚Äôt have that money? And when I reported it, Chime told me they didn‚Äôt see anything suspicious. Thank god my account balance didn‚Äôt have sufficient funds for all of the charges to go through or else I would literally be homeless. I work hard for my money and it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that a bank will let people get away with spending something I worked for leaving me unable to pay for my own bills. I‚Äôve had banks ask me for less information and have given me my money back no questions asked. 
Don‚Äôt leave a large amount of money in your chime account because god forbid somebody gets ahold of your information, your screwed if it‚Äôs up to Chime.",1,2022-10-07 12:25:43
"I couldn‚Äôt say enough good things about being with chime. It‚Äôs been years now and I‚Äôve never had a single issue or annoyance with anything at all. It is so easy and there is no catch or hidden agendas here. No fees or monthly costs. The feature Spot-me has my back frequently, it‚Äôs saved me many times.. you don‚Äôt overdraft your account ever, if you have spot me, you just pay it back when you can. You won‚Äôt get that anywhere else!!!!!!!! It‚Äôs very user friendly and everything works as it should. I love not having an actual bank I have to walk into, I can do everything I need to do with this account, I started with the debit card and got my credit builder with my qualifying direct deposit and my credit score went up almost 50 points!!!! It is still a debit card- you just put money in the account, but it does track things somehow- I get paid 2 days early every single paycheck by about 12 PM and some is automatically distributed into my savings. Chime is AMAZING!!!!!!!
I recommend it to all my friends and anyone reading this! I only regret I didn‚Äôt do it sooner. Thank you chime!",5,2024-10-06 07:26:47
"Chime promotes that it‚Äôs the easiest way to bank. They however are not a bank. They collect your information as they are a financial technology company. 
Chime states you have a limit of CREDIT transactions of 10,000 per day. But you have no option to use the card as a credit card. They only send you one card( as any bank would)however, using it as credit is not an option. 
If you send a check to someone ( as they advertise they can pay anyone fast and free) it takes a month before the person even receives it. They have no options for cashier check/ money order and make it extremely difficult to withdraw or transfer money regardless of what they advertise.
 I called customer service trying to understand why I couldn‚Äôt use my card to charge a cleaning company that provided me service with the 10,000 credit limit allowed.
 (services were 2,000) I had the money in my account. I hadn‚Äôt went over any ‚Äú limits ‚Äú that day. Only to talk to someone who can‚Äôt speak English and couldn‚Äôt answer my question. All she had to say is that I don‚Äôt have the credit card I have the debit card‚Ä¶ another card was not offered or mentioned. Nor does it say when you sign up that you will need to apply separately for a credit card. I am switching everything to another account and will not be using Chime again.",1,2024-03-18 21:43:05
"A 4.8 who makes these scores. This is by far the worst prepaid card out today. They will blitz you with marketing telling you about the $200 overdraft. The real story is they give you $20. Then they tell you to spend money like Chime wants to get the $209. They don‚Äôt really want to give it to you or they wouldn‚Äôt only make it available to people who have proven they don‚Äôt need it. When you call customer service it is very difficult to understand the person on the other end. The accents are so thick it isn‚Äôt really English they are speaking. They also have no authority and given no discretion to make a decision. Chime doesn‚Äôt really trust them. It is just cheap labor. I was at Wells Fargo were I could get up to $600 overdraft if I needed it. Chime called 3 times a week and mailed me things more often to switch over. They always mention the $200 overdraft, but never once mention how hard it is to get. That should be illegal. Tonight my card was used without my permission. They want me to wait 5 days to get it back. That is not protecting my identity or treating me like a valuable customer. It is me having to prove my innocence to a company I let control my money. Stay away from this app. It is all lies. The spot me marketing is a scam. If you are struggling at all you will never get passed the $20 spot me limit. Changing to Chime has been one of the worst decisions I could make",1,2024-03-07 06:57:23
"Chime has some nice features but I don‚Äôt see myself using this account for very much because it‚Äôs such a hassle to log into, or get customer service from. For example, I called them because someone hacked my account and it took them nearly an hour just to correct my phone number on my account. During that time I was switched to talk with 5 different people (all with heavy accents and hard to understand) and then I had to send them a picture of my drivers license along with a selfie. Again, this was all just to change my phone number. In fact, every time you try to log into your account you not only have to use your password but you are forced to solve 3 to 5 different ‚Äúpuzzles‚Äù. If you answer any one of those puzzles wrong, well, then you are forced to start the entire process all over again from the start! Then after that circus they send you another authentication number to your phone which you have to send back to them. This means you‚Äôre forced to have your phone on you whenever you log in, even if you‚Äôre using an iPad or computer to log in. Keep in mind, you‚Äôll be forced to do all of these wonderful things - even if you just want to check your account balance. Since it‚Äôs such a hassle to use this banks services, I don‚Äôt see myself using this account for very much.",2,2023-03-28 17:06:46
"Chime is a meta bank so it isn‚Äôt accepted by 90% of financial institutions which will create a huge inconvenience for most. Also they are not even based in the US so you will be talking to someone in another country with English as a secondary language equally infuriating. Currently it‚Äôs been 2 weeks & I still haven‚Äôt received a replacement debit card after chime TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES to report my card as stolen & cancel it the week I had a deposit coming when I had simply said ‚Äúplease block this merchant‚Äù which they‚Äôd done before without interfering with my card now it‚Äôs going on 3 weeks I haven‚Äôt been able to access my own money due to their sheer stupidity & lack of listening skills. Them being a meta bank I had thousands of dollars worth of unemployment money I desperately need & waited months for already returned because unemployment refuses to deal with them so now I‚Äôve had to wait an additional month for that $ that I still haven‚Äôt gotten in addition to to the debit card debacle & often customer service will lie & said they did something to get you off the phone for you to later discover it wasn‚Äôt even done!!! This is how they treat a 2 year customer NEVER AGAIN! I will be cutting these cards & deleting the app, save yourself a tremendous amount of trouble & get a real bank account with a bank you can walk into",2,2022-12-29 22:39:10
"Not a bad app to bank with sometimes they have their issues but nothing major on my behalf that wasn‚Äôt handled immediately so far my lady had an issue that took to long to get resolved because it was a communication issue the people who she dealt with couldn‚Äôt comprehend what she was explaining but for the most part it‚Äôs pretty good take a little long to receive your new cards when you order them but ultimately the system they use has a lot of perks and when it‚Äôs running good it‚Äôs running good . When the app has issues it doesn‚Äôt affect your card use and they handle it quickly and it back up and running in minutes if not sooner so I give them 4 stars . Much better than most banks trying to sneak in fees to manipulate you out of money these guys keep it simple and the credit card you get with them is definitely a plus, helps you get back on track if your credit is not so good and keeps you informed and easy to use and understand . Gotta say the chime guys are good at what they do and the only reason they didn‚Äôt get the 5th star was the minor issues . Most of the people I know have it after dealing with shyest banks and I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôve promoted it to my friends and convinced many to get chime",4,2022-05-07 12:48:13
"They do not follow their terms & conditions, they do absolutely whatever they want and get away with it because you‚Äôre just one customer and they‚Äôre a big bank. Spotme terms & conditions clearly state that you need *MONTHLY* direct deposits of over $500 in order to qualify. I check my statements monthly, and my deposits are always well over $500. My most recent check on Jan 12 was less than $500- i was expecting that since it was from Christmas/New Years and my job is always slow around then. Well because of that, my spotme was turned off and now the app is harassing me to ‚Äúset up direct deposit‚Äù. It would‚Äôve been nice if they waited until the end of the month, when my monthly deposit would‚Äôve been well over $500 again. Don‚Äôt ever bother reaching out to support, both people I talked to sent me the exact same email, word for word, that had nothing to do with what I asked. When I replied saying that‚Äôs not what I asked, I received the same email AGAIN. They‚Äôre very unprofessional, if you have a lower check than usual they‚Äôll assume you‚Äôre not depositing your entire check and turn off spotme, and if you don‚Äôt tip them (never heard of having to tip a bank??) they won‚Äôt care about what you have to say or any problems you experience with them. When I asked if I had tipped for using spotme, would this happen and their response was ‚Äúprobably not‚Äù. So now I‚Äôm signing up for a new bank and my balance will sit at -$45.",1,2020-01-20 21:19:44
"Had chime for 4 years never did anything fraudulent and did not break any of the contract rules I had a checking savings and credit card!!! Woke up Monday morning and chime had completely closed my accounts with no pre notice or anything all three accounts where closed and I have to wait 14 business days before I can get my money mailed out to me in a Check!!üò° also chime stole all my money in my account I had $5,562 split between my checking savings and credit card! Come says that I only have $520 in my account! When I told them that is not true they told me to provide proof of balance knowing that they closed my account and restricted access so how can I prove it! Chime does not email or mail out bank statements every thing is done threw this app! CHIME IS NOT SAFE OR RELIABLE 
When requesting a reason for the closure chime emailed me stating that for privacy reasons they can not provide a reason for account closure!!! I can not get any assistance or answers from chime over the phone or on line / email ! Be Careful CHIME also known as stride banks are criminals they steal money and unlawfully close accounts with no pre notification! I was not made aware of account closure or anything before my account was permanently closed! Do not use CHIME banking ever they are criminals! If anyone knows how I can go about getting the proper legal officials involved in this please leave a response.üò≠",1,2022-09-26 17:29:49
I am not typically one to come online and write a review but I felt I needed to share my experience with Chime. I‚Äôve been a customer for almost 2 years and the reason I joined was I was going through a financial hardship and I enjoyed the idea that they trust their customers enough to offer spot me as an option if they needed funds in between paychecks. Most recently I received a reimbursement check from State Farm that I attempted to do a mobile deposit through it was denied stating that I didn‚Äôt fill out the back of the check per their requirements which I did. I resubmitted the check then they decided they wanted to hold the check for over a week. I have been a great customer I have not had any return checks I have not returned any checks that I deposited it was very frustrating because State Farm even gave me proof that chime cashed the check and they still would not release the funds so they basically are holding my check hostage for another four days. I completely understand having policies and safeguards in place for the company but when the customer is telling you that they have proof that you cashed their mobile deposit you should be releasing the funds. I decided at this point to go back to traditional banking where I can make deposits add an actual bank and I don‚Äôt have to deal with this nonsense.,2,2022-08-23 19:17:21
"I have had friends and family have this app and everything work smoothly with everything especially on first paycheck. When my fianc√© gets it for his job I warned him about the pros and cons, personally I don‚Äôt like the app nor use it for my paychecks. Suddenly his deposits cant come through and he calls customer support. They are the most rude and stuck up people I have every heard and did not help, they tell him it‚Äôs his employers fault and it‚Äôs on their end. He has told them three times with his boss present that they have the numbers correct and it shows that it sent through, it‚Äôs on their side and they get more defensive by the minute. I am disappointed heavily and we tried to be civil about it and she just would not listen and kept saying that it was on his end. Until things look up I won‚Äôt change this review and it‚Äôs sad it happens over a rude support woman that doesn‚Äôt have the listening skill and comprehension skills to acknowledge it. I always been nervous about this app and I finally been given every reason to. I am sorry to leave a bad review even after all the good things I heard.

Also I have heard of people during die to their money getting taken and chime won‚Äôt due anything about it and honestly it was needed and if it comes down to it I would sue too if scammers got ahold of my card and kept taking money out of it and the keep declining my dispute.",1,2022-09-08 03:03:46
"I tried out Chime for about 2 years. Previous bank being a traditional brick and mortar bank. Chime has caused me a lot of issues by taking way too long to process transactions. I recently got a fee charged to me of 150 dollars by the DMV for declined transaction because Chime typically takes 3-5 days to pay bills. An issue I never had with Chase. Chase withdraws the amount from your balance immediately even if it‚Äôs not yet fully posted, as a courtesy for customers. Chime will wait the full posting period before actually taking the amount off your account. Being low income and living paycheck to paycheck this caused me a great many issues taking way too long to deduct the amounts from my account. Sometimes over a week. I do the same exact payment on my Chase card and it happens instantly.  We almost had our utilities cancelled because Chime took over a week before they attempted to process the payment and by then I had spent what I had because I thought it had went through. This has happened to me so many times when I got fined 150 dollars by the DMV that was the last straw for me. Had to go into the DMV and pay with my regular bank card and it went through right away. Going back to a bank that processes debits instantly rather than waiting days. Cancelling this account",2,2021-07-24 02:18:09
"I was researching banking apps and I joined Chime because I read that they had $100 joining bonus for new customers providing they set up direct deposit and had a qualifying deposit within the first 30 days. So I did all of that and my deposit came through, but it was crickets regarding the bonus. I tried to call Lynn a few times, but each time I would get either disconnected or really bad reception. I finally called in about a month later and spoke to someone who was in charge, but he told me that he could find no record of that joining bonus ever been offered. He asked if I had a screenshot, which usually I do take screenshots of such things, but I don‚Äôt recall doing that because it was attached to the app and I didn‚Äôt know I needed a record of it. I told him as much and he said without screenshot as proof he could not honor the bonus. I told him I had done research since then, which was really done while I was on the call, and I had found proof that they have offered such bonuses in the past and that was evidence enough that what I read online at the time of joining was accurate. But that was not good enough for them. So my advice is either don‚Äôt join or if you do join, make sure you document any promises they make to you. They seem to be liars.  I will be switching banking apps because I don‚Äôt want people who don‚Äôt keep their word handling my money.",1,2024-12-26 19:46:57
"I‚Äôve been banking with chime for over 4 years now and never had a reason to contact support. However, I woke up this morning to multiple unauthorized transactions totaling over $2,000 on my account. I contacted support and explained my situation to them and even included screenshots proving it wasn‚Äôt me. They stated that they would look into it and make sure my case will be resolved. Not even 5 minutes later, they denied my claims even with substantial evidence that I DID NOT PROCESS THOSE TRANSACTIONS. I called back and spoke to a guy named Juan, and after explaining the situation again, he stated that their might have been a mistake and they didn‚Äôt see the screenshots that were included and he reopened the case. I waited for 3 hours and called back, surprisingly it was Juan again who I was transferred to and he pretty much told me there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it even with the evidence that it wasn‚Äôt me. How is that even possible?!?! There was no real investigation done into my case and it got denied?!?! Will never be banking with Chime again!!! I really thought they were different from other banks and actually cared about their customers, but they‚Äôre just like every other bank. Money hungry, good for nothing, pieces of sh*t. I‚Äôm putting this review on here so people won‚Äôt have to go through what I did and to be cautious of who you bank with.",1,2022-06-03 18:37:26
"After seeing ads & TV commercials about Chime members telling their experience with Chime, I decided to give it a try. A few months after downloading it I noticed I really like it. It offered a way to get your pay check deposit in your card 2 days early & I switched my bank services over to Chime so that I can bypass all the hassle of waiting for the actual payday & it worked out for me. It also offered a credit builder card so I read about that & I ordered that card because it helps you to build credit of your own which is that I always was looking for a simple way to start building my own credit. After a few months of using to make purchases with the credit builder card I went to check my credit score online & it actually shows that my credit score is very good all because of Chime. I can‚Äôt thank you enough Chime for the services that you have provided which actually is true that you have really helped me to make & live my life so much hassle free easier. TO EVERYONE OUT THERE I VERY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU TRY GIVE YOUR BANKING SERVICES OVER CHIME THEY MADE MY LIFE EASIER & IT WILL MAKE YOURS EASIER TOO!!!!",5,2023-09-16 19:32:41
"I‚Äôm loving my Chime account. Having all the functions easily accessed on my phone has allowed me to manage my money more efficiently and monitor expenditures in real time. The absence of high fees is wonderful. I love both the ease of transferring money between accounts as well as the Spot Me feature for months when the budget is very tight. Although ATMs that recognize the Chime card are not very common, I haven‚Äôt found that to be a drawback; I rarely carry cash at all anymore and haven‚Äôt missed it. I don‚Äôt miss having a checking account, since on the rare occasions when I need to pay a bill by check, I can do it through the Chime app for free. The only drawback I‚Äôve encountered is that some businesses, particularly those that only exist online, do not recognize the Chime routing number. I‚Äôve been able to find workarounds for all but one of them. I don‚Äôt know the reason they won‚Äôt accept payments from Chime, but hopefully Chime is working with those entities to remove whatever barriers exist. I highly recommend Chime. It‚Äôs more convenient and has saved me money over the months I‚Äôve been using it.",5,2024-03-27 11:09:08
"In a world where you have BoA and Wells Fargo sucking not the just life out of your friends and family but the money you‚Äôve worked hard for with their fraudulent activity and ridiculous fees and policies, you find Chime. That ray of sunshine and hope that not all banks are that evil. Chime has single handedly gotten me my 700 FICO credit score, my savings and retirement funds all kickstarted, and made me more money in just 3 months than anyone banking with BoA will ever see in their interest payouts over the course of the next 5 years. I cant recommend Chime enough to anyone that is living paycheck to paycheck, banking at a brick and mortar bank, just getting started, or overall just wants something easier and better for themselves. Literally 0 fees, easy access to catch withdrawals, deposits, bills, checks, transferring wherever to whoever, and that 2% APY is just the icing on the cake for the savings account. The only thing Chime can‚Äôt do is help you with a loan from my understanding but at that point, just go to a credit union! Time to ditch these typical scammy banks and treat ourselves and our wallets to the finer things in life!",5,2024-09-24 15:30:51
"This bank is the worst I‚Äôve ever dealt with! I would recommend researching how the central banking system works because once you understand you can see that this bank is taking advantage of anyone wanting fund immediately or to transfer out of their bank. I strongly suggest to not use this bank. I deposit one check and an electronic payment and both time I was unable to access my money when needed. The support operators are nice but extremely unaware of their own policies. They also will give you the run around anytime you call or use the chat setting. I have been endlessly transferred on both calls and chat features in which they not only didn‚Äôt resolve but they kept asking me repetitive and condescending questions. When asked for a manager I was told no that he will communicate to me what she will tell him. I had to tell him, not ask, to transfer me to a manager. When I finally got to her she asked the exact same repetitive and condescending questions. Close to finishing the call she said there‚Äôs nothing I can do for you you‚Äôll have to wait for the IT support crew to email me back. When asked if I could be transferred she said they only communicate via email‚Ä¶ the most frustrating hour and a half of my life. I have screen shots of all these conversations and unprofessional activities that took place.",1,2023-10-25 20:00:54
"This app should have a running balance so we can keep track of how much we spend per day. All it shows are expenditures and not a running tabulation‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a problem. PAYDAYS: Sometimes I get paid one day early sometimes I get paid two days early. Sometimes I get paid on the day I‚Äôm supposed to get paid. When I first opened the app it took 7+ days just to move money between accounts using Chime.  Because chime runs through a regulated bank they should also mail a statement if we desire them. I have to print them at home.  Chime once stole five dollars from me, and I‚Äôm not sure if they ever replaced it or corrected the deficit. Chime runs their whole format based on a ‚Äúfee free‚Äù system where you can find fee free facilities in the mapping tab. Walgreens charges a dollar to load the card. CVS charges anywhere from 5 to 7 dollars to load the card. (Both are included in the fee free mapping/Location tab). When I called CHIME they said vendors such as Walgreens and CVS add their own charges. Well isn‚Äôt the point of ‚Äúfee free‚Äù supposed to be use of the card without charge. Walgreens and CVS are supposed to be partners in the system they have no right to charge for that money at the checkout and Chime has no right to claim free checking if their partners are not honoring the system in place.",2,2022-11-24 14:53:29
My Checking account was closed without notice because I ‚ÄúViolated My Deposit Account Agreement‚Äù but I was unable to be given an exact reason other than that broad statement as to what exactly I did to be put in this circumstance which I ultimately accepted. The customer service level that I was given after the fact is what is a disgrace. I tried to reach out to the Bank via phone to figure out what happened to see if I could possibly fix the scenario and an automated message comes on to tell me to email the bank instead of talking to someone directly. I then emailed asking them for an explanation and I was given a generic response with no specifics for an account I‚Äôve had for over 2 years. I then asked someone when will my payments for my employers be returned so I can anticipate when I will receive my funds to pay my bills & purchase my necessities and no one has responded to me after I asked the question twice. I understand their are policies in place but as a Human being who makes an honest living and provides for myself and others who depend on me and to have my account closed with no explanation and when I reach out to see when the payments are being sent back I get no response. Chime is constantly asking for referrals to grow their bank but when a moment arises to treat a human as a human they greatly fail.,1,2022-09-27 17:51:06
I was in love with chime the spot me was amazing the fast deposit and the online same day deposit when you deposit a check I‚Äôve been with them for about 4 years i think before they did credit cards when the credit cards started I got one they helped me build my credit however when I needed to dispute a charge because the merchant who I purchased a ticket from did not return my money I had talked to the merchant 3 times before I disputed the charge with chime  I had clear evidence that the merchant said they would refund the money chime still denied that charge every time I called people hung up on me they never explained why my dispute was denied in detail and they constantly gaslighted me when I finally got to someone they did something called a reclaim I guess and started investigating deeper I didn‚Äôt get emails or a update or anything so i took it upon myself to keep nagging the merchant until they finally decided to return my money I tried to cancel that reclaim or whatever it‚Äôs called on chime there was no way to cancel so now im in the negative im only still with them because it‚Äôs my longest credit card account my advice to anyone who wants to use chime don‚Äôt have large charges pulled out because if something happens to where u have to dispute they will probably not give you your money back,1,2024-03-28 14:47:08
This is the safest and most reliable online banking out there. It‚Äôs quick with the updates gives you your paycheck way sooner than a regular bank and on top of that they don‚Äôt charge you late fees or overdrafts they GIVE YOU MONEY-you can literally rack up money called spot me cash it‚Äôs literally money you can borrow till your next check hits the more you use it and pay it back the more you get to borrow in the future i‚Äôm up to 150 in spot me cash! Not to mention if you opt to go for the credit builder credit card you‚Äôre just helping yourself I moved my deposit over to my credit builder and when you rack up your swipes they send you a metal credit card! This is perfect for people who need to help build themselves in this broken money grab world. chime doesn‚Äôt rob you or have any fees they literally let you borrow money and build your credit...!! Why wouldn‚Äôt you want to help yourself? No i wasn‚Äôt paid or sponsored from chime( i wish cmon it‚Äôs an online bank for crying out loud) I‚Äôm just trying to be honest drop the old time banks and hope on the chime train you won‚Äôt regret it. üòå,5,2021-06-04 15:34:01
"Love this App-non-bank&cards! Been using it 5 years and their savings, and credit building cards! Please can you fix the card freeze/lock and unlock menu and set up! Take away those extra steps! Make this faster! When I‚Äôm at the checkout and I forgot I locked it It‚Äôs embarrassing to trying and figure out where I‚Äôm at! which card is it showing me? the fake card or the real card to unlock!? Pls This used to be easier and now it‚Äôs more complicated!?You guys are too good for this! I want my debit card at the top and my Credit builder next to it and I want a lock/unlock button! all on the same page! Fast so I can fix it at the checkout and not get cussed out by the customer behind me! Or do it wrong and have my transaction denied! Embarrassing and frustrating. Works great, compatible with my employer, get all deposits and transfers immediately and payroll/government checks 2days early! No fees! Over draft free with limits based on income to the account. I‚Äôve been through full-time employment down to unemployment with this account over the past five years it‚Äôs been awesome throughout!",5,2024-10-30 14:48:58
"Chime is the bank of the future and it‚Äôs done an amazing job. I love banking with Chime. It‚Äôs incredibly simple through its reliable app. The platform is simple, well laid out, pleasant to view, and gives you just the right info at your finger tips. Each time I spend from my account Chime alerts me with the transaction amount and remaining balance. Not to mention NO FEES!  When I think of how much procrastination has cost me in fees?? That payment that cleared when I wasn‚Äôt expecting it ...  then auto withdrawals stack one on top of another??  $$$ I‚Äôm sick. Chimes new credit builder is like a gift program for you. Here!  Here is a great way to build your credit without even trying!  Chime will even ‚Äúspot you‚Äù some cash over time to help cover your expenses. You earn your spot amount over time and it comes out of your next deposit. Easy. Wonderful!
Downsides include no checks.  ( I hate checks and thought I‚Äôd never need any, but have found sometimes you just do.)  The ‚ÄúChime Bot‚Äù in the app is not helpful. It‚Äôs infuriating not being able to get answers. It‚Äôs kind of like You last Alexa over and over and she has no answer to anything.  
Overall though Chime is very satisfying and I am so happy to have it.",4,2020-11-18 21:21:08
"I have tried many many MANY online cash apps and this one is hands down the very best one!!! Extremely user friendly, helps my credit with the credit builder account, helps save with the round up option, & is accepted almost everywhere.  I have a ‚ÄòMyPay‚Äô balance that helps me with money when it‚Äôs close to my paycheck and I run out of money at the end of the bills. In addition to that the ‚ÄòSpotMe‚Äô function has saved me from $100‚Äôs  of overdraft fees that I would have accrued.  I am no longer worried that I can‚Äôt buy milk at the store or put fuel in my car when my check is gone. I have a little bit of cushion and you can not put a price on that comfort!!!!
 I have referred 5-6 people and will continue to refer everyone! We both get $100 referral fee but only if they have a direct deposit set up. Two of my referrals do not even have that option at their work.  That is the only complaint I have with this referral program/cash app. I wish I would get something for them downloading it from my referral even if it‚Äôs a higher spot me balance, etc. 
Absolutely wonderful!!!!!",5,2025-03-01 14:16:54
"So I‚Äôve been with Chime for about two months now and already I‚Äôm seeing things that I completely dislike number one they let a big charge come off my account without my permission, yes, they ended up giving it back to me, but I feel like it shouldn‚Äôt happen in the first place, especially if they texted me about the charge, and I replied no and the charge was able to still come out that‚Äôs not good. Secondly, theMy pay feature lets you take out maybe $20 in the beginning then you‚Äôre cut off basically not able to access whatever amount that you were approved for in the first place which for me it was $100 but they keep telling me oh every day the amount increases and the amount that is available to you out of your hundred dollars is $20 but they choose to update it by 4 to 5 dollars daily and me I get paid every two weeks so by the time it reaches $20 I‚Äôll be getting paid again so what‚Äôs the point of me having my pay if I can‚Äôt access the paid that they are saying I am approved for in the first place. It‚Äôs always a catch and all that let me spot you stuff in Holiday Inn just always a not what it supposed to be thing with Chime and I‚Äôm really about to close this account.",3,2024-07-19 17:13:42
"Chime was good for the first 2 months I had it. However, there are two issues I had which will prevent me from ever using Chime again;

Made a withdrawal at an Allpoint atm. The transaction was denied according the the receipt but the money was still taken out of my account. It was $240 and that is a lot of money to me. Chime said they have to investigate it and I won‚Äôt get a provisional credit until 21 days after my claim. That‚Äôs even if I qualify for one. Completely unacceptable on Chime‚Äôs part and Allpoint. The only way to avoid this happening is to go to credible banks like Chase of Wells Fargo where this would never occur, but then you would pay $3.50 per withdrawal.

The other issue was that for no reason I was locked out of my account. I couldn‚Äôt login to my chime mobile app or anything. So I called chime support and asked what was going on and if I was hacked or anything. They couldn‚Äôt tell me why they locked my account or what reason. They had me send a photo of my face and ID and a paper with specific notes to their email I order to unlock it. I had never had fraud on the account prior to this either. No explanation was the last straw. What if I was driving and needed gas ? They shutdown my entire card and account. Couldn‚Äôt believe it",2,2022-06-12 19:20:58
"Do NOT OPEN AN ACCOUNT WITH CHIME!!!! Go to local bank that have real walk-ins and actual have real people you can speak with face to face. I requested information on a transaction that was made and they decided to rather give me more information about the transaction they deactivated my card. I never gave them the agreement to close my card. I found out the hard way while i was shopping and trying to purchase my itmes and my card was declining. I called customer service multiple times to tell them that it was an error from their side. I requested a temporary card and THEY DO NOT GIVE YOU TEMPORARY CARD AT ALLL!!! You are stuck waiting two weeks for a new card to come! You can not even take out your money and they lie to you by telling you can transfer your money to another bank for ‚Äúeasy access‚Äù but once i link another bank and try to move my money, my money disappeared!!!! They lost my money and its not in my chime account and its not in my other bank account. Talking to customer service is the worst, they will just transfer you to another department and ask you the same three questions because they themselves dont know what they are doing. Worst bank ever! They dont help you when you need help! They dont value you as a customer! I SUGGEST you open an account with a local bank that gives you Temporary cards while your card is being shipped out.",1,2020-08-31 15:36:04
"Unfortunately due to a career loss, having to start over and struggling financially for 3 years I had no other choice but to file bankruptcy. I was told by my legal counsel that the bank account I had would potentially freeze my limited funds because one of my credit cards was linked to my checking. They encouraged me to seek a new checking account so I could maintain what money I had. Because my credit was now poor, I was denied by two other banks a checking account. Most big banks now run your credit along with Check Systems to deem you a desirable customer. I researched my options and found Chime on a tech blog. I‚Äôm so very glad I found it! It is no frills checking and savings with a super simple app. It‚Äôs a traditional debit card in every sense. It‚Äôs Visa so you can use it virtually anywhere! Get cash back with groceries. Tons of ATM‚Äôs through money pass with NO fees! I know it may not be for everyone, but if you are sick of big banks and all their fees and tactics, I encourage you to give Chime a try. I‚Äôm very grateful to have an option like Chime. It saved me a lot of grief at a time when I‚Äôm already feeling insurmountable pressure.",5,2018-06-07 00:45:40
"I‚Äôve had Chime for over 4 years. I‚Äôll be totally honest with you, I‚Äôve loved them until recently. Chime will steal your money eventually. I had a dispute with a $600 purchase made on my Chime account. Chime denied my dispute without even investigating the situation and then refused to re-open the investigation. On that same denial with that merchant, the merchant gave me a full refund. Which shows how Chime made zero effort in the investigation. Then Chime kept my refund. I‚Äôve been fighting Chime for over a year on my $600 refund. They refuse to give me my money. Denying any and all attempts at a dispute. How does a back keep my refund issued to me by the merchant? I have no idea how they get away with it but their is absolutely nothing you can do about it. 
Do your research on Chime. A simple Google search will prove that Chime will steal your money. They have mountains of legal action against them from their consumers. The law firms are so backed up with Chime clients that they can‚Äôt take any more victims. 
Be very careful on deciding to do business with Chime. They will steal your money and it won‚Äôt be a small amount. They won‚Äôt protect you from theft, fraud charges, or any type of dispute. They will hold your dispute for 3 month just to give you a denial and won‚Äôt even investigate the situation. Don‚Äôt put yourself in a situation with Chime. You will loose.",1,2021-11-30 17:54:26
I had got a new phone number and was asked to login again I provided the information to login but was asked to verify my identity with the last four of my social and debt card. Since I placed a new request for a card I didn‚Äôt have one so I tired via text message but with a new phone was not able to login so I contacted customer support. I sent in all documents they needed except messing up on one where I had to write my name dob on a paper as well as I hold my id and paper in hand while trying to take a picture. After I sent it in they asked me to resend all my documents over again and again while having to wait 5-10 business days. I understand security measures but this was way out of hand and I never received my debt card or my credit card after a month of waiting for either one and then I called again to replace those two card and was told it‚Äôd be another two weeks. This was the most difficult frustrating experience I‚Äôve ever had with any bank. I was simply trying to login to set up my direct deposit but had no help whatsoever.,5,2023-05-24 01:54:35
I had dealt with a ton of bad banks who would charge fees and the overdraft fees because they overdrafted your account. I lost my paycheck once to a bank and they were fighting tooth and nail not to give the money back. So when I found chime and there was no fees I gave them a try. No problems in the couple years I‚Äôve been with them. I had an issue way back in the first with someone buying something using my card details because I saved my information to an account that got hacked. Chime immediately took care of it gave me my money back and gave me 30 minutes to go withdraw money if i needed while waiting for a new card to show up. Which it came 2 days later. I had money going into my savings most banks you have to a minimum of $10 to keep it opened. But after losing everything last year when I had family steal from me and cause me to lose my jobs and I was working three at the time. I took my savings money to pay bills or buy cat food. China hasn‚Äôt yelled at me about savings only having two cents in it‚Ä¶lol yes two cents‚Ä¶. Highly recommend chime..,5,2024-07-12 21:08:49
"If you are paying ANY fees with your current bank, stop and switch right this minute! I've been a customer since 2016 and have NEVER had an issue with Chime! They allow me to write checks w/o checks and THEY mail them to the recipient. They allow me to deposit checks with a picture. No need for check cashing places with their fees. I get paid two days earlier than my colleagues and all of these features come without a fee. If your need more than that, well, there's always under your mattress! Give Chime a shot! If you want to make a $100 dollars for you and a current Chime customer, take the referral from the Chime customer and set up direct deposit. The Chime customer will receive $100 and so will you. Did I mention they will spot you up to $200, if you come up short on purchases without fees? You have to pay it back of course, but most overdraft protection charge you for the privilege. I can't say enough about Chime that I haven't already said, give them a shot, you won't regret it and be mad your didn't do it sooner!",5,2024-03-25 02:28:15
This is a great way to start out with your first bank while also getting the worse support. I filed for a credit card with them to attach to my main debit card and the card never came until I filled again with customer support for the second time to get a new card and that card never came in. Sadly enough the card is connected to my account and I can‚Äôt take it off. My wife filed and got hers on time and used it just for 4 months later that it drops her credit score. I used the pay friend feature and mistakenly sent the money to the wrong person. I filed a dispute after telling 4 different people the same story. They finally filed my dispute and investigated it 40 minutes later they email telling me is no error and it‚Äôs settled. Now I can‚Äôt my money back or credit for it. I added my card to my taxes. Nope bad idea. They asked for my information and I sent it in they held my account foot 3 weeks before asking for my information again then decided that they‚Äôll investigate to see if I‚Äôm really who I say I am. Finally I receive my money after my wife and I called 3 times and complained to customer service about not receiving my money after a month later. Bank smart try BB&T or Navy federal because the customer support is horrible and they‚Äôre not serious about your money like you are.,1,2021-05-26 16:26:25
"For starters I realize why a real bank account is needed . This is a financial app not a bank. There is a huge difference. I use this ‚Äúapp‚Äù for many reasons, one of them being that I‚Äôve heard great things about chime . However that‚Äôs not what I am experiencing . I place a order on uber eats using my chime card, my food arrived stale, I went to reach out to uber they denied me a refund even with pictures, okay cool nor problem is what I was thinking . Well I went to dispute it with chime and the also denied my dispute even with me sending in proof of what the food looked like ! This happened to me twice when I filed two disputes through chime. When I called in to speak to a rep to have them to review my dispute they immediately denied me. I knew then why it was important to have a physical bank on your side. Now I‚Äôll just use chime for my play money, I know to not take them serious. Also I am looking at transactions on my card that were made days ago on weekdays might I add, but chime has placed a new pending charge for a bill that I know I paid two days ago. THAT IS STEALING! That money left my account the day I paid it! I have the time and date for a few bills that are that don‚Äôt match chimes time stamp! I watch my balance closely and I am missing money",2,2024-11-06 17:40:57
"They need to change the set up direct deposit limit and requirement because if you don‚Äôt have a job in yourself employed you‚Äôre screwed they need to change the limit and the requirement they shouldn‚Äôt even be a dag on limit to be honest because if you if you self-employed, you‚Äôre pretty much screwed you won‚Äôt be able to do a mobile deposit if you‚Äôre self-employed and then on top of that the limit to set up a direct deposit they have to so I mean if you don‚Äôt have a employer or LLC that you received your funds through that can deposit at least a dollar into your account you‚Äôre screwed especially for some people that hasn‚Äôt started LLC and they just need a way to store their funds and know that is secure even though I know banks is not always secure but it‚Äôs just so that way you‚Äôre not walking around or carrying around a whole bunch of funds with you at all time or in your location at all time they need to change that limit and the requirement you shouldn‚Äôt have to have an employer or you shouldn‚Äôt have to put a dollar in there from an employer or LLC just to be able to do a mobile deposit like that‚Äôs just stupid.

"After going through many different negatives with multiple Big Banks, for years I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that i can‚Äôt come up with 1 negative since I‚Äôve had my account! I opened it in 2020 to receiveA relief check from the government that would allow the check to get directly deposited into an account providing a faster process to access money! well, since then, I‚Äôve never had a late fee extra charge I aggravating phone call or a bad customer service situation one time I even had a fraudulent transaction in 2020 when I first moved to Philadelphia and within four days the money was put back in my account. I can‚Äôt explain how many times I had to argue with customer service or a live banker about 100s$ in late fees that were taken out of my account when my paycheck deposited for spending $1 when I didn‚Äôt have it! And this is more then one occasion with multiple banks! Chime allows you to borrow 250 automatically if your account with no charge or accidental fees!

"I got Chime originally as another ‚Äúdirect deposit‚Äù alternative to my regular bank account. Bonus, you could get paid 2 days early!! That was at the beginning and it was fantastic up until the last month or so. I never had issues with getting my direct deposit or mobile check cashing, again until recently. I used to mobile deposit and my money was available right away and best of all no fees for anything and I even had the overdraft. Which if I had a short week, it was just perfect for gas or groceries, but not so much to take my next paycheck. Recently, things have started to change. I‚Äôve had to call more than once about my money and check cashing. My direct deposit always hit the same time because payroll always sends the same time. But it still is not posted and that‚Äôs even with the direct deposit receipt from chime to my employer. It‚Äôs sad really, I truly enjoyed the ease but when getting my money means I have to use the bot to get a call, it‚Äôs time to move on. I also had the credit builder and am glad I waited because if I have issues with getting my direct deposit, I can only imagine what would come up with the credit builder.",3,2021-01-14 18:50:27
"You are the worst! All of you should do yourself a favor and dip out ASAP. I am dealing with a fraud and it is taking more then 60 days for them to complete. Every time I try to get a hold of them they keep telling me 45days on the 47th day and 45days after. Always 45 days. They refuse to return my funds and never have a live representative to talk too. Their Resolution department does not have a phone number and refuses to talk to anyone. Their HORRIBLE. I just went out and got a new bank account. This bank can ruin someone‚Äôs life with all the loop holes you have to go through if 1 thing goes wrong. You have no protection on your card and info. Good luck if your trying to speak to someone who speaks proper English. Your dealing with someone else‚Äôs money you should know how to talk so they understand. I was also lied too and told by A representative that I would have my money back into my account on November 30. I saw that it was never there so I called back and was told again, 45 days. I will never use them again. I had the case reopen and been waiting with PROOF and all. I refuse to put any money into that account until it‚Äôs solved. But I just went out and got another bank account that is much better. Do yourself a favor don‚Äôt deal with the hassle and get something that will protect you.",1,2020-03-31 18:38:55
"I love chime. Works as good or better than my previous brick & mortar bank. I was initially concerned my income would be more than Chime was designed to handle but my concerns were for nothing. I‚Äôm connected to all my credit cards & bills etc & Chime has made my life very easy & simple where I‚Äôve no concerns, no worries with handling & managing my personal finances for the past 3 1/2 years- as of October 2022. 

Thank you Chime! Now offer mortgages & car loans that would be great! However not a deal breaker as I said, I‚Äôm very happy with Chime exactly as is now too!

PS: I did also try Varo & Simple prior to Chime as well - Varo during first year with chime for a few months but I switched back to Chime‚Ä¶ - hope I can say those other names? lol‚Ä¶ regardless I sincerely recommend Chime as truly being the cream of the crop-especially for me & my personal experiences w/online only banking. Credit builder card is great even if u have excellent credit like me btw- on the fence? Simply dive in I‚Äôm confident you won‚Äôt regret it & no I‚Äôm not in any way affiliated nor work with nor for Chime. I simply value & appreciate them!",5,2022-10-17 19:52:01
"I was told last night a stop would be put on the merchant who I am disputing a charge with. I never received the product or service. They keep saying the merchant has been blocked, there has been a stop on the transaction yet they still let this merchant to continue to try and bill me! They literally dont know how to protect their customers. Will you just do you job and protect your customers from predatory merchant practices. I was told a stop was put on this merchant, they were blocked, their transaction is being disputed and now I‚Äôm STILL GETTING a message saying my card was being billed by this scam vendor. I messaged the vendor  on 12/26 providing ample notice to cancel my subscription and provided proof of this and no response. The app has a decent UX but Chime has the the WORST outsourced bank customer support by far. Untrained mass oversees call center. Resolve the dispute ASAP and stop them from trying to charge me! I was told last night this was already done. Worst of all, I was told I needed to order a new card in order to stop this predatory merchant from charging me. What a joke! Get some U.S. based competent customer support or bleed customers this upcoming recession. It‚Äôs so awful it would be borderline hilarious if it wasn‚Äôt happening to me. You are cutting costs in the wrong departments Chime.",1,2023-01-04 06:30:08
"Chime has got to be the best bank out there. 4 years ago, I was struggling to find a good bank that had no hidden fees, and could help me build my credit without the hassle of paying off credit card bills. Chime came out of nowhere with ZERO HIDDEN FEES, pay ANYONE regardless if they have chime or not, and their AMAZING CREDIT BUILDER CARD. Now just 4 years later they also have up to 2 DAYS EARLY on direct deposits, Spot Me which is a FEE FREE overdraft account, and MyPay is select areas which allows you to borrow from your next direct deposit EARLY. 

Now let me explain their credit builder card for some people; When you sign up for chime you get the options for 3 accounts. Your standard Checking account, a Savings account (with ZERO FEES) and a Credit Builder Account. The Credit Builder Account allows you to put money in it, and use it as a secured credit card. The kicker is, it can only POSITIVELY affect your credit. Since it‚Äôs really your money you‚Äôre using, your ‚Äúcredit card bill‚Äù is always paid off. 

Chime is a must for anyone trying to get some stability in life.",5,2024-09-22 17:26:51
Chime was there for me when no other bank would even deal with me. They not only get you your checks early that soon as your check shows that it is available through direct apposite they make it available within minutes. I have never in my 54 years had a bank make sure that right before Thanksgiving my check came on the 23rd so that I can provide a Thanksgiving dinner for my family.   It may not seem like a big thing to other people but when you‚Äôre on a fixed income and you don‚Äôt have a lot of money having your check available for you to buy dinner or pay a bill early it‚Äôs a blessing. They make sure that they do your disputes on time and faster than any other bank. Personally Chime has been a godsend to me over the past few years and I think God that they help me. They also have a spot me feature that you provide a tip when your direct deposit comes in and you have a multipleOptions on the percentage of a tip that you pay for them covering you anywhere from $45 to 200 depending on your monthly direct deposit amount . Thank you Chime bank,4,2021-10-26 18:28:23
"Starting off, I opened a Chime account because I started traveling with work. I was dealing with a brick and mortar bank that really wasn‚Äôt able to do the things I needed being away from home. Apprehensive at first I set my direct deposit up and turn on both the roundup savings feature and the 10% saving feature. It has made saving mindless and reflects in your balance instantly. 
My FAVORITE feature about chime though is its statements. It, well pretty accurately categorizes your expenses and you can see what amount of money goes to what each month. This is huge. It really does bring some spending habits to the front and center. 
One thing that is heavily advertised is the ability to get your check credited two days early. I can attest to that, it happens every week for me. I signed up to see if it works and have now got accustomed to it, and it has come in handy with having to drive sometimes across the country at a moments notice. 
Overall, I have had a very good experience switching to Chime and look forward to banking with them for many years moving on!",5,2020-05-13 00:52:11
"All in all Chime Checking, Savings, and Credit Builder Accounts are good with receiving Direct Deposits a couple days early and are fairly easy to navigate and to use for various Banking services. The ‚Äú$200‚Äù Overdraft Protection is MISLEADING! When signing up for Chime Banking to be your primary Banking for your everyday life business i quickly read over the Terms and Conditions and Chime is very much aware of what they are doing when they word the Overdraft Protection as ‚Äúup to $200 with qualifying Direct Deposit. I‚Äôve been with Chime for a little over 6 months now and my Overdraft is at a measly $25 and there is absolutely no way to request an increase. They claim that they will increase your O.D. based on the amount and duration of your monthly Direct Deposits. My direct deposits have been in the several thousand range every month from the beginning consistently and I have only received a $5 increase which is ridiculous to say the least. I don‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of switching my primary Bank again so I‚Äôm sticking it out. Also when disputing charges and requesting a chargeback due to merchant deception I have not been reimbursed the two times I‚Äôve had an issue.",3,2022-10-30 03:43:22
"Depending on the circumstances of your disputed transaction, good luck getting your money back. Figure out how to answer the questions to get refunded, vs actually answering them truthfully. I am not supporting or advertising trying to rip off chime but if you have a charge on your account that you didn‚Äôt make claim your card was not in your possession and you have no idea where the charge came from etc. I believe that if you state that you have had possession of your card and you don‚Äôt believe it was physically compromised by anyone, your not getting your money back. I had a charge on my account from Ebay, which I don‚Äôt even have an account for and stated to Chime support that I have had my card in my possession and don‚Äôt believe that anyone else had access to it. In the meantime, I tried to contact eBay about why they charged my card without my consent, I was never able to talk to anybody because you have to have an account to talk to Ebay support of any kind. Frustrating and infuriating to say the least. The best luck I‚Äôve ever had with disputing a charge was PayPal, but that was years ago, and I no longer recommend PayPal due to ridiculous inconveniences lately with tripping security flags and getting denied access to my PayPal account while using it as I always have.",1,2022-10-25 18:39:41
"I am very thankful for Chime and it's affiliates , as they have been so helpful to me with the many versatile great features they offer through the Chime app.  From helping me building my credit back up and encouraging me to save and a checking account that you can link up to your credit acct and your savings.  Plus the greatest feature that I love most of all is that the app has a Boost Me feature which acts as a cushion for when your funds run out and if you need that extra boost or cushion to help cover the overage you might have and they don't charge a overdraft fee.  Overall, Chime is and has been my life saver and has been my #1 supportive app for my banking needs.  I highly recommend Chime to anyone, especially those looking for a great new checking Acct that really does get you paid a couple days earlier from pay day! I know because I'm living proof that I confirm that feature is actually true.   I don't know how they do it but I love that surprise when I had forgotten and least expected a paycheck till Friday.  Thank You Chime!",5,2022-10-29 19:11:24
"I have to admit I was like the many that when I seen the goofy commercials with the people wearing all the green and talking it up that I never believed that I would be a Chime customer boy I‚Äôm glad I was wrong. Everything about Chime is great. The only negative I have is to the signing people up. It almost seems like it‚Äôs a gimmick because I‚Äôve tried three times and my significant other has tried twice, and as of yet, no avail as far as making any money doing that other than that everything else is just great overdraft fees is the topper not having them anymore. Plus, it‚Äôs like two accounts in one with the credit builder and the checking account. The fact that you can transfer funds back-and-forth you can make money on the side through other money making apps that it suggest and I haven‚Äôt tapped into everything yet, but the main points make the service wonderful. I am a tough customer and I give this banking app and service 4.5. !!!! Thanks Chime and Stryde Bank for the excellent service !!!                     Respectfully Michael J. Anderson",5,2024-09-19 11:13:53
"I‚Äôve been using Chime since 2018, and I have nothing but good things to say about this mobile bank. Direct deposits at multiple jobs have been a breeze, effectively ‚Äúmoving my payday‚Äù to more like every other Wednesday/Thursday instead of every other Friday or whatever have you, which comes in extreme handy when you need your money sooner. I do like the Credit Builder feature, which I started using last year. My credit score went from not existing, to a decent registering score, allowing me to actually get my first real credit card. And of course, I participated in the ‚Äúpurchase 40 things within X amount of time‚Äù event and I got myself one of the Metal Credit builder cards! I believe I have one downside, the withdraw limit when I need to pull large amounts of cash out to purchase something (a used car on Craigslist, buying something expensive etc.) it forces you to wait 24 hours if you exceeded your limit and that can be pretty annoying sometimes. All in all, good bank with almost 0 issues. Highly recommend.",5,2022-09-01 04:57:02
"It‚Äôs an OK online bank that I use for my funds from what I make on ridesharing services but it‚Äôs too limited. In order to deposit cash into the card, you have to go to a local store (Walgreens etc) and have a cashier load it for you. Not hard to do, but it is a hassle because the Walgreens I go to are a bit far. My problem that I have is the mobile check deposit feature they have. I thought at first it was nice enough they have that feature since I receive paper checks at my job for the time being, but what really upsets me is how long it takes for it to go into my account. It is now Saturday Dec 23 and I submitted my check on Monday Dec 18 and it still hasn‚Äôt gone. I contacted them and they told me ‚Äúrest assured you‚Äôll receive your money by Dec 26?!?!? AFTER THE HOLIDAYS?!? I have bills to pay specifically my car insurance and phone that cannot be held off. That‚Äôs literally the worst thing about this is the mobile check deposit. When I had SchoolsFirst the mobile check deposited would be almost automatic if it the next business day. All I have to say is if you are considering chime, use it as a backup bank, NOT as your main as it will hold up on your checks. Take it from me.",2,2023-12-24 01:04:47

"Chime has been my bank for a number of years now and there‚Äôs a lot of benefits to it like SpotMe and early direct deposit. However a few key things make this bank extremely frustrating. For one, customer service is rarely actually helpful and has repeatedly just straight up not listened to what I‚Äôve said when I bring an issue to them. They also seem very unaware of most of Chime‚Äôs features and policies which can be super annoying to deal with. The Your Paycheck feature is being replaced by something nearly IDENTICAL but it is not available in the states where the other program was. I can‚Äôt understand why this is, and I‚Äôve come to unfortunately rely on this as money is pretty tight. This is forcing me to start over with a new bank that has similar features and more stable policies. They site ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù as to why they‚Äôre discontinuing the current system, and yet when I call to give feedback they say they can‚Äôt take the feedback, but put me on hold for several minutes and can suddenly take feedback and escalate. It‚Äôs a real love hate relationship with Chime, and as time passes I‚Äôm feeling a lot more of the latter, but it is a fine enough bank to get by overall.",2,2024-05-15 03:16:42
"My experience with chime has been very upsetting. I got it due to the fact that everyone said they loved it. Within days it had switched my Direct deposit to my job without my knowledge. I then had to pay my bills using chime, but I didn‚Äôt have a chime card and to make matters worst it would NOT connect to my bank account. I tried multiple times even contacted chime and my personal bank. After about a week of nonsense, I finally decided to close my account to which it took 3 days and I had no way to access ANY of my money. Not to mention I also needed to pay bills, but Christmas presents, and get groceries. After finally closing my account I was informed it would take 30 days to get my money in the mail in the form of a check. I contacted customer service to maybe know a tracking number or ANYTHING that might let me know if it would come sooner to which they responded ‚ÄúIt can take up to 30 days‚Äù I knew that I had already emailed very politely and asked them. They gave no new information and didn‚Äôt seem to care if I was gonna be broke for 2 weeks waiting to be paid again. In all I do not recommended chime and I feel very upset with how things happened and how it ended. Update: still haven‚Äôt received my check in the mail. I‚Äôm waiting chime.",1,2022-12-23 04:54:01
"I was very pleased when I first had Chime, no issues at all. Then I started to notice that there was transactions being made with my card. I am very protective of my information but somehow someone was still accessing my funds. One night it was a transaction over $100, I reported it as soon as it happened. They gave me ‚Äúcredit‚Äù to replace the missing funds while they investigated what happened. Investigation done and they say that it was me that made the transaction and they will be taking the ‚Äúcredit‚Äù back.. I was furious and even told them to send me the investigation paperwork that proves I made that transaction. Weeks go by and I look at the documents and the address was different, I see multiple transactions that were never made by me. The transactions were made in a different state with different information. I got even more furious and told them that and they said I had to submit information to prove I did not make those transactions. None of it made sense. POOR customer service, long holds while on the phone‚Ä¶closed my account and went to Wells Fargo and been happier ever since. Chime clearly has security issues and should be used for children. No adult with money should trust Chime with your funds. Warning everyone from now. Chime has to do better.",1,2023-08-16 12:50:15
"I‚Äôve had an account with Chime since they began. And I have yet to have a complaint. The app is kept updated and runs very smoothly. I like the auto savings feature. I do wish there was an interest gathering savings and more banking features like loans etc but it‚Äôll come I‚Äôm sure. Many companies have followed Chime to online banking (which I believe will take over banking and do away with brick and mortar banking eventually)but none of the others are quite as well established. I‚Äôve referred many people to chime and they‚Äôve done away with their banks and rely solely on chime too. 
   I haven‚Äôt seen rewards and bonuses lately like once would surprise me. But there are offers and a few discounts available. And I dislike how I have to enter my pin every time I move away from the chime screen. Even to go back n forth to copy/enter routing number account number on  another app and go back to chime, even when I didn‚Äôt close it out. But it‚Äôs fine also. Their customer service is outstanding. And security has never been an issue. I have nothing negative to say about Chime.",5,2019-09-11 08:10:37
"Best bank I‚Äôve ever had & I‚Äôm tech inept so I never thought I‚Äôd have an e-bank & now, I‚Äôll never go back or switch. First I got a debit card & they really do deposit your $$ as soon as they get it. Everyone at work gets paid Friday, mine comes Wednesday & it‚Äôs quicker if you make a return to a store to get the refund to your account. Then I opened a savings, love that too. They started asking if I wanted chime secured credit & I didn‚Äôt think I did but, it‚Äôs THE best choice I‚Äôve made. Got it a couple years ago & if you‚Äôre someone looking to build and/or work on your credit score- GET IT!! Solely from having that account, I got my credit score up around 100 points shockingly quick & since then I‚Äôve been able to get a prime & capital one card & have amazing credit. It‚Äôs also just super convenient. I‚Äôm constantly telling people to get chime if they‚Äôre looking for a new bank & I‚Äôve never rly cared what checking or bank I have cuz they‚Äôre all the same & there no real thing setting them apart, much less above, the rest‚Ä¶ til Chime!!üíµüí≥üí∞",5,2024-07-20 04:51:49
"I have been with Chime for a few years now and it is the best. My son gets his disability check deposited to my Chime account (he is a minor). His check should be available on the 1st but I get it on the 25th/26th of the month before. I love the spot me feature. Some banks, when you go into overdraft, you get fees and sometimes you lose money. This one, you don‚Äôt lose money you are still able to use it. They now have a feature called MyPay. It‚Äôs a cash advance. At first I was approved for $50. Once that got paid back, I was approved for $100. And just a few days ago when that got paid back, my limit went up to $120. The only thing about it is that you can only take the advance out by a minimum of $20. So like if I take from it and there is $10 left, I can‚Äôt get that $10 until it gets paid back with the next check. So you‚Äôre not losing money either way. You‚Äôre kind of gaining money! Love it! My spot me limit is $90 but when I send 4 boosts to family, I get 4 back and my limit goes up to $110.",5,2024-07-31 02:05:55
"This is a problem if you‚Äôre only using Chine as your main account. I have many other account and I liked the thought of a Chime account. However, Chime has an issues with mobile deposits. I‚Äôve tried three times to mobile deposit a check and I was told by customer service that my checks was fraudulent and Chime did not have a record for f the banks. The check I tried to deposit was a check from Comcast that I received for returning my equipment and another random check from a vendor. Chime would not accept neither of these checks no matter how many times I tired and when I called they blacklisted the check as invalid. I was able to mi Ike deposit the Comcast and vendor checks with zero issues with other reputable and trust worthy banks. I cannot recommend Chime due the the mobile deposit issues. This is unacceptable, because people get checks for many reasons and if Chime is marketing their services to black and brown communities the inability to mobile deposit a check when there‚Äôs no physical location is unacceptable and very troubling. I CANNOT RECOMMEND CHIME. Use a traditional bank that has physical locations. Their are better online options as well out there. YOU ALSO HAVE TO PAY TO DEPOSIT CASH TO YOUR CHIME ACCOUNT.",1,2023-02-24 21:03:17
"I've used Chime for over two years, and it has denied every mobile check deposit I have tried whether personal check, company check, government check, or any other kind of physical check. So, I have to take any and every check to some other banking establishment to cash it with a fee and then pay a fee to have it deposited into Chime in increments at a time at places like Walgreens or Walmart, so I never even get the full amount of any check I receive. I follow all instructions by Chime exactly to a tee and have contacted Chime via chat, email, and phone, and they can never give any reason except that the check wasn't accepted by some panel of a few people somewhere who make these decisions, with their apologies. In fact, the only explanation ever given and repeated even by agents over the phone is that the check was not accepted and not to attempt to deposit it in Chime again, but that the check hasn't been cashed so I can take it to another banking institution to cash it. That's it. No further reason or details, regardless of what kind of check or who it's from as I stated above. And it happened to me again today with another check not accepted.  Otherwise, Chime is convenient if you never use cash or any form whatsoever of physical money.",1,2022-03-18 12:08:06
"They advertised $100 spot me limit, I‚Äôve had them almost a year, close to $40,000 I‚Äôve put in this account in 10 months and they‚Äôve only given me $20 spot me til this day, on the very few rare times you can actually get through on the phone (Customer service is a joke that‚Äôs non existent) they always tell me they can‚Äôt lift my spot me limit to their advertised $100 limit. They need to be sued for false advertising. If you ever have a problem with a charge, good luck getting through to a live representative, they forward you to a chat box in the app in which they took 3 days to respond to me in ( I‚Äôve Got The Receipts to prove it ). I highly suggest signing up for other banks that actually give you what they advertise like Current, who pays you up to 2 days early ( chime advertises 2 days early but I‚Äôm never paid then, always paid 1 day early) and actually gives you the $100 credit limit. Chime is a joke that I‚Äôve waisted almost a year of my life dealing with, credit builder was the only thing that stopped me from closing sooner, but it‚Äôs been 2 months and they still haven‚Äôt reported to 1 bureau after I‚Äôve spent $4000 on their credit builder card ( I‚Äôve got proof ).

I‚Äôm in Wisconsin‚Ä¶ give them all my info and send them my schedule and time punches saying that it‚Äôs not me and that I am at work NOT FLORIDA! They continue to take more money out of my account all my rent money actually so also couldn‚Äôt pay rent on time, but what‚Äôs funny is they(chime) keeps saying that there is NO mistake in the transaction so not only did they not help me in anyway in this whole incident I lost a months worth of MY HARD EARNED money worths of rent. No compensation or credit. They will not help and the extra security they have you installed and it doesn‚Äôt do anything to help either they will continue to leak your info and give it out to random people. I‚Äôm only a young adult and trying to survive so this was a big blow to the face because I did like chime for a long time but I think this just proves that not all are good so please if you still want your hard earned money do not get chime.

"When I was having a difficult time getting a debit card chime signed me up with a $0 annual fee, and no minimums!  They sent me a card within 7 days and still no fee. Then a few months of keeping a good balance and no problems they sent me a secured credit card to help me build my credit back up. And after using it for a few months I got upgraded to a all metal chime credit card. Still my favorite card to use! Haven‚Äôt had a single problem with Chime (unlike all the other banks I‚Äôve had). I also recently had to use ‚Äúspot me‚Äù, which is essentially their version of overdraft protection. However the big difference is you don‚Äôt get charged a fee to use it! Nor are you required to make your account positive by end of business day. In fact as long as you pay it back within a few weeks you don‚Äôt get charged a single fee! Absolutely amazing I Would highly recommend whether it‚Äôs your first account or your just tired of dealing with the big banks and all their hidden fees!",5,2022-09-10 05:02:40

Can‚Äôt even talk to a real person. And today I checked my credit score, it made my score go down 53 points. I was 10 points away from being able to get a home owners loan and now I‚Äôm screwed. It also reported that I owe $57 and I don‚Äôt owe any money. I have made every single payment on time. This was the worst decision and I wish I knew before I completely screwed myself and ruined my credit. I‚Äôm beyond angry. This was suppose to help and it hurt me more than anything.

They playing like they can‚Äôt track it or see what‚Äôs going on I‚Äôll just give a boost and a push so Chris, Chime CEO please expect a lawsuit from me due to this matter. I don‚Äôt care about who doesn‚Äôt like this review neither. So Chris, CEO get me money now to avoid it or just deal with it. I‚Äôve made police reports about this matter. The AHC or ACH options seems to me as not an option but they will send the link. Chris, CEO you will be hearing from my lawyer. CEO Chris I‚Äôm taking this matter to the press today at noon. It‚Äôs ten days later no card and Chime can‚Äôt expedite another card well I‚Äôm going to explain everything to the news press today at noon.",1,2020-02-08 09:50:26
"It is true that people write a bad review before a good one. Overall I enjoy chime, I get paid early and with it being a holiday week I got paid EXTRA early which was a pleasant surprise. They did have a recent shut down that did decline our cards when we tried to use them for 2 days which was inconvenient and kind of embarrassing but the issue was fixed and they continued to show remorse. My only suggestion is I wish it showed the ending balance as purchases are made on the statement.  I don‚Äôt like not being able to look back on purchases of deposits and not see what it brought my balance to at that time. I work at financial institutions and sometimes that‚Äôs what we require for proof of payment, so the fact that my bank doesn‚Äôt provided that is something that definitely sticks out for me; and in general it would help me keep track of my spending a lot better to know what I keep my balances at throughout the weeks. They seem good at looking at reviews, not sure if this is a concern for anyone else to make it a change but it would be nice if that be involved in a near future update.",4,2019-11-26 12:27:27
It‚Äôs disgusting how chime is slowly handling my situation because of chime I‚Äôm forced to sleep in the car with my kids !!! And chime is doing absolutely NOTHING about my account !!! I have done everything asked and I‚Äôm constantly having to wait and wait and wait and for them to keep telling me the same thing. WHY does it take 24 hours to send a email ‚Ä¶.. then it‚Äôs a email of the same information I have already provided by far the WORST EXPERIENCE !!! How many 24 hours is my kids and I going to have to sleep in a unsafe environment HOW many 24 hours am I going to have to tel my kids I can‚Äôt feed them because I HAVE NO MONEY I have lost my job thanks to chime and I will be loosing my kids if this situation is not handled chime is causing more problems in my life by taking EXTREMELY LONG TO HANDLE MY SITUATION chime does not care how severe my situation is and I‚Äôm disgusted at the entire process and I will NEVER bank with chime again !!!! how many times to I have to call it‚Äôs really sad and I will end up killing myself at this point because chime is RUINING EVERYTHING FOR ME OVER THIS LONG PROCESS CHIME IS ALLOWING MY KIDS TO GO HUNGRY !!!!!! DO NOT BANK WITH CHIME BECAUSE THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS BECAUSE I HAVE CALLED FOR OVER A WEEK NOW IM LITERALLY LOOSING EVERYTHING BECAUSE OF THIS LONG PROCESS VERY UNHAPPY,1,2022-10-15 18:49:59
"I‚Äôve been a user of Chime for over a year now and I wish I could be pleased with this company. The $100 limit for SpotMe is impossible to attain no matter how frequently your paychecks come or the amount they come in. I‚Äôve been a faithful repaying customer in SpotMe over the last year and my limit only reached $45, then fell to $20 when I lost my job due to Covid. I referred over five friends who signed up for chime through my link. The link my chime app gave me was faulty and didn‚Äôt give me proper credit for the incentive, so I forwarded Chime plenty of screenshots and emails proof so that they would see I was the reason for those new users and get the incentive. Chime did not apologize for the faulty link, did not accommodate any type of manual incentive, and the agents who responded closed all of my issues and told me they couldn‚Äôt do anything. If you have any type of issues with SpotMe or the friends incentive, chime agents can do nothing for you. They give you long wordy excuses about how there‚Äôs many factors involved and how nothing can be done and close their issue. What‚Äôs the point of having representatives if there is nothing they can do, even to keep a loyal customer. This company is a scam, go to a trusted bank if you want to see them follow through with advertised benefits because this isn‚Äôt for you.",1,2020-07-14 16:08:23
"I‚Äôve been a chime member for a few years now and unlike local branch banks or fdic banks, after you‚Äôve been an account holder for a little while they allow fee free overdrafts! They do this for up to a certain amount and if you have friends that also have chime they can boost you every month to up that amount, giving you more to overdraft and it just comes off your next deposit! They‚Äôre easy to contact and get help from, after moving to California and losing all my info I called them and they helped me get all my information back with a few security questions of course. You can quickly transfer money between credit checking and savings accounts as well as send to other people with chime from the app! The credit card is AMAZING, just move money into it to your desire each month and as you use it, they report to the credit bureaus and build your credit rather than having to pay a deposit to get a secured credit card! They‚Äôre a pretty awesome online bank and I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôll every stop using them!",4,2024-09-22 00:50:32
"I‚Äôve had zero problems using Chime and the Chime app! I‚Äôve had some rough patches I needed to go through financially during my period of filing for disability. No fees to deposit cash at my Walgreens! When I had to have auto draft, Chime was able to stop any charges for NSF while I scraped up what I needed to pay the auto draft the second or third time through. No fees whatsoever. Not even from who was attempting to take the auto draft since it hits it every couple days or whatever to try to auto draft it. This gave me time to get the money needed into the account. I‚Äôve had customer service help me during another issue that was resolved in my favor. I also have direct deposit with them and they never have any issues with my money being there. Everything I do to manipulate my money is simple with the app. I have paid zero in fees for anything. I had no problem trusting them with a settlement check direct deposit, either. No need for me to ever change my banking service. Ever. Great job, Chime!",5,2024-10-19 22:56:48
"This was the first time I opened an account at a bank I could not physically attend. This was a brand new account. Decided to have our refund deposited into it. BIG MISTAKE. They started asking for proof of refund which we sent. They pushed the funds through. We had access to the funds in the account for over 2 weeks after the fact....Then, I try to log in to check the balance and pay a bill...account suspended. The only explanation I was given is that something (that something could never be fully explained) was falling outside of their banking terms? They asked for a bunch of other info (License, SS cards, Utility Bill) to unsuspend the account. I‚Äôm like REALLY?? Can someone tell me what is happening? Nothing. Me thinking it‚Äôs just some kind of misunderstanding I sent in the necessary documents and still no answer. I‚Äôm now feeling like my money is being stolen and we‚Äôre being defrauded! They have over $2k frozen that we can‚Äôt get an answer as to why! I‚Äôm so upset I could cry. I have no idea what happened, I‚Äôm getting no explanation and I‚Äôm in the process of seeking an attorney! This bank takes people‚Äôs money and suspends accounts for no reason and provides no explanation. Do not trust them with your money!! 8 years I‚Äôve done the same transaction with my regular bank and I‚Äôve never had this issue. NEVER.",1,2019-03-27 20:37:18
"I opened a Chime account after seeing it was so highly rated. Big mistake. I had $450 deposited into my account. The terms 
say that you can do one transaction before you get your debit card. Not true. I emailed the company to ask why I was not getting my one transaction. They kept sending me the same response that had nothing to do with my question. I tried transferring the money to my PayPal account. I‚Äôve verified the account with PayPal. Chime still would not send my money to me. Or to my PayPal.
I bet I sent them over 10 messages. And then all of the sudden I get an email saying that my account has been closed. With no mention of the $450 that I deposited. If you were looking for a quick alternative to PayPal, this is not the answer. You never get to talk to live person in customer service. What a joke. I wish I knew how to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.
I wish that I could post screenshots of the conversations I have had with their ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù. What a joke. They‚Äôll take your money (instantly), freeze your account (30 days except they‚Äôll tell you you can have one transaction which isn‚Äôt true), then they can close your account for any reason they deem okay. To top it off, you‚Äôll have to wait 30 days to get your money back. (In the form of a check.)",1,2018-12-30 19:21:44
"Having chime since 2016 has provided a lot of first, marriage, children, our own residence. When I became a Chime member I would here from a lot of people using the big box banks not to trust online banking. Casting there doubt aside, Chime has really changed my life. From the ability to have try overdraft protection, which taught me how to budget the expenses that I had and how to save. Then when the 200 dollar over protection kicked in, it allowed me piece of mind to assure all bills were paid, and anything that was needed for my daughters, diaper, milk, could be provided with no worry. My credit was still in the dumps no matter how hard I tried. Then I got the alert about the chime credit card! I started utilizing the credit card to pay household bills and started to see my credit creep up to the point where I would‚Äôve never expected in that short amount of time. Not to mention my pay, which at this time with the economy is the perfect buffer my family needs to feel safe, secure, and independent.",5,2024-10-05 06:31:38

Don‚Äôt get me started on chime spot me! Booooy, let me tell you I stopped borrowing from my momma and started borrowing from chime. Going up a level felt like another level with my relationship with chime. I am now at the maximum $200 spot me amount and it sure does come in handy. I have saved so much in overdraft fees I laugh when people say they got a NSF charge from their bank, like chime would never. Chime loves me too much to hurt me like that. Chime wants to see me shine they don‚Äôt even charge me ATM fee if I just find an eligible ATM which is almost in every corner in my city!

"I cannot for the life of me figure out how to build credit with this app. I directed deposited over $200, I referred friends got the referral bonus of $100 and everything, finally after a few week I was able to open a credit builder account with a $200 dollar transfer and waited over a month and no credit was reported to any credit Bureau agency, but as soon as I paid my families cell phone bills it reported a low credit balance to the agencies and NOT the on time phone bill pay. And it didn‚Äôt report my credit utilization it only reported my low credit credit worthiness of the $10 left in the credit builder account after the phone bill funds were taken out. It did not report the fact that I had a previous credit utilization of 0% on the $200. It‚Äôs like you gotta leave the money in the account and never spend it, but if I do that they won‚Äôt ever report anything to the agencies. This app is NOT for building credit at all. Thanks for causing a drop in my credit score by decreasing my credit utilization rate, lowering my credit history length and reporting a low credit balance which all work together to show even more bad credit worthiness on my report.",1,2024-01-12 18:23:18

And when I say I‚Äôm a happy customer I truly am I next to never leave reviews for anything unless they‚Äôre bad and I needed to warn somebody to not buy or use whatever product or service they are contemplating. However, chime banking is a smart and safe choice for if you need a primary or secondary bank or just some thing on your phone every day bill pay or honestly even a savings account. They even have a credit building feature if you need to work on your stuff a little bit. I can always get somebody on the phone and for the most part customer service it‚Äôs always very helpful polite and respectful. They even have a feature that allows you to be on a queue to be called back in case you don‚Äôt have the time to sit around and wait on the phone. There are so many aspects of Chime.

"I mean, overall, I‚Äôve had this, account for good six years, now I just started doing the direct deposit which means I got much more privileges and it‚Äôs great but
1 The my pay advance don‚Äôt get me wrong. It‚Äôs great but every time you check deposits and let‚Äôs see you have the consistent $100 but every time you check deposits it drops down to how much you can use per day until it goes back up to that hundred when I really don‚Äôt even use it in fact, I‚Äôve used it one time..
2. On that same subject if you do use it, they take the whole thing out your next payday now I‚Äôve also had cash app for probably 10 years when I had the loan they allow you to pay it over four  paychecks., which the great side of that is sometimes people don‚Äôt have or Least  would help people because even a cash app. You have the option to pay it off early so if you don‚Äôt.

"You are the worst!  All of you should do yourself a favor and dip out ASAP. I am dealing with a fraud and it is taking more then 60 days for them to complete. Every time I try to get a hold of them they keep telling me 45days on the 47th day and 45days after. Always 45 days. They refuse to return my funds and never have a live representative to talk too. Their Resolution department does not have a phone number and refuses to talk to anyone. Their HORRIBLE. I just went out and got a new bank account. This bank can ruin someone‚Äôs life with all the loop holes you have to go through if 1 thing goes wrong. You have no protection on your card and info. Good luck if your trying to speak to someone who speaks proper English. Your dealing with someone else‚Äôs money you should know how to talk so they understand. I was also lied too and told by A representative that I would have my money back into my account on November 30. I saw that it was never there so I called back and was told again, 45 days.

"Chime is only good for simple transactions, in any situation where you are being stolen from, or have fraudulent transactions on your account, chime fails to provide you fair, clear, and thorough research based decisions when it comes to crediting their customers or resolving transactions you would determine or any other bank would determine as fraudulent. Chime consistently denies claims their customers say are fraudulent regardless of how much work or effort the customer personally puts into researching the fraudulent transactions the bank and any other bank would do for their customer. You could have a legal police report regarding your incident of fraud and chime will still deny your claim of fraud and repetitively put you through a cycle of asking for additional documentation in terms of research. The customer facing fraud team can not do much either to help the customer along the way and it ultimately leaves the customer feeling disappointed in the overall management of their funds. They are thieves, and any traditional bank handles and can account for your money far better than chime. As chime is a banking technology app, I‚Äôll also direct some heat at the banks they utilize to house their customers finds horrific experience.",1,2024-09-20 13:50:36
"I‚Äôve been without a known commercialized bank for about two years now, after switching to chime. NO FEES! That‚Äôs very important to mention. The alerts are instant as well. I also receive my paychecks or any direct deposit faster using chime. The app is so easy to use to transfer funds from checking account into credit builder account and there‚Äôs zero delay or lag. The app technically has had zero issues for me ever. Depositing cash is the only area I had to get used to in a different way but it‚Äôs so easy. I go to the Walgreens check out cashier or location the app shows closest and have my card and cash ready and the cashier deposits it. Depositing checks is easy at your own home using the app. I really love the ‚Äúspot me‚Äù feature. Life happens sometimes and if you need a spot of a little over your balance, so long as your normal direct deposits meet criteria, chime will spot you and NEVER charge and over fees.

I updated the app, my iOS, the app again, changed passwords, did everything I possible could - reached out to the completely frustrating and utterly useless customer support team - I have sent them so many emails, screen shots, screen recordings, follow ups, I can‚Äôt even count - every time I send them an email and they give me the most useless basic advice, and it‚Äôs always a new person responding and seems like they cannot see my conversation with the previous person IN THE SAME EMAIL THREAD - so they ask me for a screenshot or recording ALL OVER AGAIN, this has happened more than 4 times! I tried using the phone line - but firstly there are NO REAL PEOPLE THAT I CAN TALK TO!!! and secondly your chat bot DOES NOT WORK!!!! I have tried so many times to ask the most basic questions because nothing on the menu suits my questions - NOPE!!!!!!
I could give zero stars if I can but Apple does not allow for that. This is my LAST attempt at possible reaching someone, ANYONE???? at Chime to hopefully get my issue resolved.",1,2023-10-06 15:37:53
"I‚Äôve been a chime customer for years and in that time they‚Äôve continuously upgraded the banking experience by first offering no fees none ever not even a penny.  
Then they added overdraft amounts a set amount for each customer that goes off your direct deposits the more you make the higher your overdraft is. 
Now they offer loans that if getting immediate access to is a $2 fee but if you choose next day it‚Äôs completely free and they always release the money within hours I‚Äôve never had to wait longer. 
Lets not forget the secured credit card that actually works to raise your credit score I went from a 620 to 725 all I did was keep my account positive and kept my savings account positive with at $5 in there and in three months my score was that high and growing. So it works I‚Äôm so glad I got it! Plus they send you a metal one for free after keeping your account in good standing 
There‚Äôs more like a new payday loan.  
They always try to help and don‚Äôt ever leave surprises or unfair lending. 
My recommendation if it means anything is to become a Chime member and watch the way they really are different from other banks like being to pay anyone even when they‚Äôre not a chime member no fees also your  deposits available immediately no waiting. The early pay- I get paid on the 27th to 28 th  3 days early. I can‚Äôt rave about them enough.

"Chime has some of the worst customer experience, and that‚Äôs compared to notoriously bad companies like Bank of America. I closed my account to quickly after I requested all my funds be transferred out, and so my bank kicked them back to Chime, who had already closed my account.

I got an email saying I needed to provide a written statement from my bank, into why the transaction was sent back and a list of other identification items in order to re-open my account. I‚Äôve called three days in a row now to try and avoid having to do that. The first person didn‚Äôt know I could re-open and account and said I had to wait 30 days for a check for the amount that was kicked back. I asked for this in writing in an email that never came. The next two times I had the same conversation, each time being told a check would come and an email confirmation would be sent, still no email. 

This bank is a fraud and uses the ridiculous ‚Äúperk‚Äù of getting paid not two days early, but usually 1 day before payday (it‚Äôs up to two days early, so no guarantee that happens, mine was only one). That does nothing and I would rather get paid on a normal cycle then have my bank make it impossible to get a straight answer and give me my money back.",1,2019-10-25 13:04:13
"It sooo easy to get caught up in the whole getting paid two days early thing but other than that.. Chime is pretty much a joke. They‚Äôre WAY too relaxed when it comes to your money and take pride in dragging their feet with everything they do. I called Nov 8,2018 for a dispute and a month later after their Customer Service rep said that he had taken care of everything, I had yet to get my money back. After spending days trying to get a human on their customer support line I was told to use the app for my issue. Why have a customer service number if you don‚Äôt want people to call? 

I also lost my card Dec 10 and have yet to even see my new card. My account has been locked for almost a month now. When I call, I get the same generic answer ‚ÄúYour card should arrive in 7-10 business days.‚Äù Again... it‚Äôs been almost a month. At this point, I‚Äôve already transferred all of my money to my new bank account elsewhere and I‚Äôm not thinking twice about closing out this card. Be careful if you‚Äôre tech savvy as well, The whole communications and control of your account through the app seems promising at first but given this company seems to be more for show than doing their actual job you may benefit the traditional banking like Chase or TD Bank.

"If your looking for a mobile bank this is what I recommend. I have tried other ones and so far this is the one I have stuck with. I get paid two days early, wich I love.

I withdrew $400 it gave them to me with that transaction I chose ‚ÄúPrint Receipt‚Äù so I found out the limit to withdraw is $500. I then started to withdraw $100 more I chose ‚ÄúNot to Print a Receipt‚Äù bad idea because then the machine sounded like it was pulling the money and it was ready to dispense. When I get an error message on the screen saying ‚ÄúThere was an error dispensing my money to please call my financial institution.‚Äù Which I did I called them they asked me for the receipt number which I didn‚Äôt have because I chose not to print a receipt. If I had a receipt they could of helped me faster. What happened next was they filed a dispute. I had to print out some forms, fill them out and fax them to them.

It‚Äôs really easy too access anything you‚Äôre looking for, and even if you can‚Äôt find what you‚Äôre looking for, they have the help service provided and are SUPER helpful! I had a problem with my payment info at one point and they helped solve the issue for me. I thought I lost my card so I had to order my second one and it came when it said it would which was about a week. They notify you if anything were to come up, warn you about any back holidays, and are SUPER helpful with the spot me, just as long as you‚Äôre having consistent income coming in, it‚Äôs VERY convenient. The only thing I‚Äôd say is up your account but AFTER setting it up, linking your other bank info. I was teaching my grandmother how to set it up to get her started and it took a good LONG 5 minute set up and both were getting really annoyed because it just kept dragging out.

"What started out as a good thing, My Pay! It turns out they change the terms after you‚Äôve used it a few months.  They‚Äôll approve you for $300 but then will only allow you to get $25 a DAY! How does that benefit someone that gets $1000 deposit, Chime repays themselves their full $300 and without warning they still say you‚Äôre approved for $300 in My Pay but I can only access $25 the first day and then the next day it‚Äôll say only $13 is available of My Pay BUT they have a $20 withdrawal minimum!! At the time I had actually been approved for $500 in My Pay. The next month because my next deposit was not deposited until 32 days later, My Pay dropped to $300 but I could only get $25!! And each day they would say $15 is available, then the next day it‚Äôs $13 more available! How does that help when you‚Äôve paid yourself back $500, so now I‚Äôm down to $500 out of my deposit and then of the $300 you say I‚Äôm approved for I can‚Äôt even access that!! My rent was late because of this! When I move in 3 months and I‚Äôm closer to my local credit union again, I‚Äôm DONE with Chime!

"This app has completely saved me. I was afraid to go into a bank and sit there for hours to open a new bank account. I obviously did not make good financial decisions before. But this app has helped me to have an actual bank account to deposit my checks, save money, and build my credit. Simple information was required, but it took minutes instead of hours, and no papers or packets to take home! All the information was emailed, and the information is very transparent. I can see exactly what I spend my money on, I get notifications when money is spent and when I get deposits, and the features are awesome. 
They offer a credit card, NO MONEY DOWN, that I can add and subtract my money from with the easiest of ease. It‚Äôs so easy for me to pay my bills now, and to build up my credit. I‚Äôm so happy I am using this app, it really has saved me from having to use a prepaid ‚Äúdebit‚Äù card and now I actually have a bank card for all my online purchases, and a credit card too!",5,2021-09-17 17:53:39
"I‚Äôve had such a hard agonizing time with my actual bank. That trying to find a suitable and reliable banking app seemed inevitable, until I came across Chime. I don‚Äôt write reviews but I‚Äôm being honest when I say you will not be disappointed. All the round up, and credit building, savings, incentives and ways to utilize this app and your financial goals in one seem less app is impeccable. You might like no fees, maybe you like fees up to you but there are none here, maybe you didn‚Äôt work your regular shift and need a little extra for food Chime helps, don‚Äôt feel bad we all go through life obstacles. I like that you have no guilt worrying about overdraw fees not that I use it but I‚Äôm so much happier knowing my card is able to do that and is accepted everywhere with no false charges unbeknownst to me to cause me frustration. 

I‚Äôm not great at reviews but hope this helped any doubters sincerely. I truly love Chime so thanks for creating an alternative banking option for people like me. Simplicity at its finest!",5,2021-06-03 11:49:08
"Their slogan is ‚Äúbanking as it should be‚Äù and it really is. I made an account here in a whim and didn‚Äôt activate my debit card or put money in the account for a while after I had it. I totally regret that now! I‚Äôve been using my account for around a month now and Chime is just so amazingly helpful. The app makes me feel so much more in the know and Chime as a bank does make me feel financially cared for. Sending alerts that easy/quick to read, even including little emojis, something you wouldn‚Äôt think would make much difference right? It does. Little details like this (for me anyways) made it so it‚Äôs not as scary or daunting to get alerts where with other big banks I would turn them off. Another sweet little thing is if you go to a restaurant or salon, somewhere where a tip is required, as soon as the merchant swipes your card you get your update but Chime includes what the 15% tip would be. So simple, such a huge difference. Gah they give me all the warm and fuzzies. Making banking and finances so approachable. Love this.",5,2018-12-13 15:43:57
"I've been using chime now for over 5 years now and they have been hands down the best, most solid bank I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with! Prior to chime I really hated having a bank account with any big name banks because not only did it drive me crazy that I had to pay someone to basically hold onto my money, but also that it constantly felt like banks were trying to pull one over on you unless you had a significant amount in your account. With random fees popping up, overdraft fees that would put you in debt, etc.. With chime, I've never ONCE had anything of that nature happen. Spot me is such a helpful tool to have when you live pay check to paycheck. Sometimes things happen, and as a mom of two littles, having the assurance that if needed I can spend the money that isn't in my account at that time without having to pay for insane fees is such a huge blessing. Please don't ever change Chime!!!! I will forever bank with you.",5,2024-10-03 16:11:24
"I have been with chime for 2 years now and take advantage of the credit building as well as my savings and everyday account. I like that you can round up and automatically send money to your savings so you really never even miss it all while building a pot for later. I love that you can transfer or pay friends and family and not have to have a card for all the various apps out there like cash app, Venmo, Zelle etc and that you can simply pay out of your chime acct no matter what they use. And best part with no fees! You can easily deposit paper checks immediately upon receipt and you can easily mail out a paper check if need be all from your app. I had some fraudulent charges that did come on my account and it was no hassle at all to call the customer service and I told them which ones and they reimbursed me then and there. There is nothing that isn‚Äôt first rate. They have checked all the boxes and I am stuck . Thank you chime for simplifying my life.",5,2022-10-14 22:59:12
"Due to poor decision making in previous years, my credit is not the best‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôve been using the Walmart money card for longer than I‚Äôd like to admit and I was looking for something with just a little more with it than just cash to electronic payment. Found Chime from a friends Facebook post and looked them up. They were comparable to what I was already working with and seemed easy enough with a few perks so I set up a profile, got a no strings attached card sent to me, and downloaded the app. I received the card in just a few days. I deposited $100, used it to pay a bill, and some morning McDs visits. Chime has round up transfer to savings, secured credit builder account and more. After a couple of weeks (cause I reject change) I decided to switch over completely. I‚Äôm can‚Äôt wait to see how much this improves my credit score‚Ä¶üòä if your currently using a prepaid debit card, the switch to Chime is worth your time. Hope they use that as a slogan and give me perks for it. ü§£",5,2022-02-24 11:32:47
"I‚Äôm one of those many people who has suffered from having so many over drafts, Chime was awesome for their Spot Me and absolutely no overdraft fees. As of recently, I had been trying to mobile deposit a check. I‚Äôve never had issues before. For some reason their app will not read my check, said it couldn‚Äôt read the bottom, it claimed poor image quality, that they couldn‚Äôt read it when it was plain as day. It had great lighting, solid dark background no shadows, there was NOTHING wrong with it. It time after time after time I tried told me it couldn't read it. I reached out to support THREE different times and they were no help first time taking over 24 hours to get back - said it was poor imagine quality and only their app could process it. Weird right? They refused to believe it had anything to do with their system and told me I need to again process it through the app and thats the only way to do it. Enough to make me switch banks as their support will do nothing for you because they ‚Äúcant.‚Äù",5,2021-01-04 17:18:52
"This was the best card I‚Äôd found out there that offers the most services and has no fees! Until they blocked a fraudulent charge for me after texting me to see if I made the charges or not, I replied no, because I hadn‚Äôt even heard of the company and couldn‚Äôt get a human to answer the number provided at the charges. So Chime replies that they blocked this charge but then a few days later let the charge go through. I disputed the charges and have had to submit a hand written appeal to my dispute when they denied it because they said once they were able to reach a human it was for a travel company or subscription and they still won‚Äôt help me! I finally after calling 4 times got a human to answer saying I had a subscription to a book company that sells digital books, I‚Äôd never heard of the company at all, but he offered to give me a refund but since I had to cancel the card and cut it up because of the fraudulent charges I no longer have that card so they say without it I can‚Äôt get a refund. And Chime has been absolutely no help to me at all! What kind of customer services is this?",3,2021-11-05 03:29:51
"It used to be such a hassle to use a home, getting a new card ‚Äî they wouldn‚Äôt expedite a new card, and since it‚Äôs an online bank, you were screwed until it came. And customer service, multiple times, when asked what recourse I had would say, ‚Äúit‚Äôs probably a good idea to keep a back up bank account.‚Äù But now, they‚Äôve gotten a lot better about the process of getting a new card reissued. They now accept mobile check deposits, at least up to a certain amount. And the Spot Me feature they‚Äôve just come out with is really cool, since Chime doesn‚Äôt usually work with the other apps that will front you money when you need it. Also, there‚Äôs no withdrawal limit on ATMs which is really cool. It looks like they‚Äôre finally starting to get their act together. The only thing I‚Äôm still annoyed by is that my card is issued in my nickname, so if I get a check written out to my legal name, they won‚Äôt cash it. Other than that, they‚Äôve fixed most of the issues I used to have with them. I appreciate it!",5,2019-08-16 19:47:31
"I‚Äôve had chime for a long time now, just got my 2nd debit card because my original one expired. I gotta say I love Chime. Once I got my first deposit 2 days early I convinced my closest friends and family to sign up, so we all got referral bonuses, and on top of that we can all send each other money if needed in an instant any time with no fees. 

They have several partners you can use to withdraw at ATMs with no fees, and there are also places you can go to deposit cash/checks within minutes. Once you have your account for a while you get a feature called SpotMe, which allows you to overdraw your account by a set amount with no fees. Now that I‚Äôve had it for a while I can overdraw up to $120 below my account balance. Additionally, you can actually withdraw cash using SpotMe if you‚Äôre in a pinch. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the more recent Credit Builder feature. My credit score has increased 30+ points over the course of the past 8 months, if you need help maintaining your credit but don‚Äôt like traditional credit cards this is 100% the answer for you as anything you purchase with your card helps your credit. 

Only drawback for me personally is my investment apps such as Webull or Robinhood do not accept the account to deposit/withdraw to or from. Otherwise though I would wholeheartedly recommend this banking service. I am not paid for this review, I‚Äôm just a guy that has had a genuinely good experience for several years.",5,2022-07-12 18:48:39
"I have been a member of Chime since 2016 are usually handle most issues I have through the app or the web. This is the first time I have an issue with the transaction that I am trying to dispute. I brought some artwork from a small business back in June, and never received the merchandise, what I did receive is a lot of empty promises and monthly emails from the vendor stating they will get it out to me, but they never did. And then to add insult to injury once I finally after reaching the six month mark of not receiving my purchase contact customer care, thinking that I will be able to dispute the charge and get actual assistance at least. I am met with several representatives, who either do not understand what I am requesting or giving me the runaround and transferring me to multiple different departments, and still not giving me any resolution so now I am out of money I no longer trust this service and as soon as this is resolved, I will be closing out my account and transferring my money to a new bank, that I can trust these issues when they do arrive will be handled with care and actually investigate on behalf of the client, or the buyer, which is me the person who puts the money into the account!!",1,2023-11-01 04:38:29
"Beware of their referral scam. I used the link sent by a family member to sign up for the referral program in December and did not get the 75 referral money nor did my family member. I contacted their support and was told that I didn‚Äôt follow the steps when I did (Some auto generated message)  Second time this happened I literally walked my referral step by step through process & documented date & time. This is now January. Deposit was over 200, my referral used link sent to phone to set up direct deposit , & it was within 30 days of signup. Today I contacted customer service again since my friend let me know they didn‚Äôt get the $75 sign up bonus and to my demise I got the same auto generated message. DO NOT REFER ANYONE THROUGH THIS APP!!  They pick and choose who to give the referral too. Mind you I even sent proof in this time (photo of the day chime was set up & email address linked to the account I referred ) because I was scammed last time. Neither I nor the referral got our money. They dont look into the inquiry at all!!! I got an auto reply within minutes of submitting. We will be switching to a more reliable direct pay company that honors what they are advertising!! Issue could of been more serious and all you guys do is sent bots to handle your customer service !!!",1,2021-01-20 18:46:35
"I attempted to withdraw funds from my account. My hard earned money. The ATM did not authorize my withdraw, even though I had 4 times the amount that I was trying to withdraw available in my account. Only seconds after the ATM denied my withdraw, I get a notification from Chime that I withdrew that money. Chime told me to wait until the merchant (owner of the atm) settles the transaction, meaning I have to wait until the transaction is no longer pending, and my money would be available in my account again. 2 days later the transaction was no longer pending, but of course my balance was not restored. So my money is lost in cyber space. I had to file a dispute, it could take up to 45 days for me to get my money!!!! And the customer service rep had the nerve to tell me that I‚Äôd only get my money IF they found an error was made!!! Um... I attempted to withdraw money from an ATM, I didn‚Äôt get any money, and you subtracted it from my balance... OBVIOUSLY there is an error! My money has basically been stolen by 1 of 2 banks and I believe the problem to be with Chime because SO many chime customers are having the same problem! Something is definitely not right with Chime! Stay away!!!! Unless you don‚Äôt value your hard earned money. I repeat STAY AWAY FROM CHIME!!!",1,2019-01-26 23:09:36
"I love love love using this banking institution. For one, their SpotMe overdraft is sooo handy and convenient. For people like me who live paycheck to paycheck and not always having just enough to cover bills or groceries, or even gas for my car, the SpotMe feature comes in handy and covers it for me (up to certain amount). Payments/transactions also 98% of the time come out instantly so you‚Äôre always aware of what your true available balance is‚Äîand if you set up their notifications, you‚Äôll receive real time notifications of what you just spent somewhere, and what is remaining without having to pull up the app. If you have to pay someone, and I mean anyone, with Chime you can! They don‚Äôt even have to have a Chime account and can still pay them FEE FREE which is a huge bonus cause those pesky fees are annoying.  AAAND, Chime pays me 2 days earlier with their direct deposit!! I just love their banking institution and it truly has been a huge help for me with how they have made the processes so easy.",5,2024-03-22 12:59:33
It‚Äôs pretty good for the most part. The my pay has become increasingly ridiculous. They might give you a higher pay limit but honestly IF you reach it it will take forever. There almost isn‚Äôt a point in giving you one and the being required to take out a minimum of 20$ but stopping you at 18 for days on end. This was a perk originally for me but now I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs not really needed seeing as my actual bank account does what it needs to and I get paid early. I‚Äôm starting to lose money with Chime. It does what it‚Äôs supposed to with relatively ease. But the perks are starting to be less of perks if you lose the money from the my pay by it having a lack consistency. I spend the same and make the same but they do not raise the same. Meaning I‚Äôm loosing money each time I pay back and it take 2+ weeks to get back to where I was when I took out. I like them as far as them just housing money. So in the long run it does what a bank should. I like the spot me. That was nice and thankfully consistent.,4,2024-12-15 08:14:35
"To be honest I‚Äôm brand new to the Chime Banking craze, I‚Äôve always used Big Banking institutions. And I suppose I become complacent with the regular ‚Äúservice fee‚Äôs‚Äù such as overdraft fees and account service fees. Some of them just seem so random at times while looking at my statement from big banking. BUT, now big banking has some serious competition!! Chime is the way of the future with us no overdraft fees. Actually( no service fees at all) It‚Äôs ‚Äúspot me ‚Äú features is genius. The app interface is so user friendly and easy to navigate. I do all my Bill paying online through the mobile application. Never have to write a check again. I just submit my payer information and chime writes and mails the check for me even notifies me expected arrival date as well as when my Check payment was delivered! Awesome guys!!! Keep up the great job y‚Äôall continue to do each and every day for your customers. I believe at this stage I think I‚Äôll be a loyal customer for life..üëèü§ô",5,2021-08-06 06:52:27
I had chime for a couple years and they were great. Had no problems and got paychecks two days early. Then the pandemic happened and I had to move back home since not making enough money and so that meant I had to get unemployment. Unfortunately that meant applying in the state I was working in which is different than where I‚Äôm currently staying. So Chime thought it was suspicious and possibly fraudulent that I was getting unemployment money in another state. Want to guess what they did next? Locked my account and kept my money hostage for themselves. Even the money I worked hard for that wasn‚Äôt from unemployment! Should be illegal. So I did exactly what they asked of me and I sent them proof in multiple ways and where the money came from. I took screenshots from the unemployment website of the transactions and I sent them a governmental 1099-G form to prove where the money came from and yet they still closed my account and made me wait 30 days to get my money for a check all during a pandemic when everybody is struggling. So great to hear that chime had my back when I needed them the most. Great jobs guys. You screwed yourself over of doing the right thing and kicked me while I was down. Hope you‚Äôre proud of yourselves.,1,2021-02-23 17:54:17
Do not do ‚Äúbanking‚Äù with Chime! Mind you this was an account I opened to use sort of as a savings/emergency account. I called to ask about a simple account transfer that I don‚Äôt even remember making and the lady told me it would take 2-3 days to show up in my Chime account after it was already taken out of my original bank account. I don‚Äôt even remember transferring from one account to the other in the past 2-3 days! They‚Äôre also telling me there‚Äôs nothing they can do to stop it and my other bank is unable to stop it either. Now I have $100 floating around somewhere out there but it‚Äôs definitely not in either one of my accounts. I will definitely be trashing my Chime card and cancelled this scam of an account after I get my $100 back. Please do yourself a favor and do your finances with actual financial institutions. Don‚Äôt let the whole ‚Äúget paid 2 days early‚Äù sucker you in. You never talk to actual people when it comes to ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù and we you do they don‚Äôt know where your money is or what is going on with your account. It was a mistake even opening an account with these people. I‚Äôve never had this much trouble with any financial institution until I started doing business with these people.,1,2019-04-09 20:13:12
"I used to be an advocate for Chime and recommended it to everyone until recently. I lost my card and they ‚Äúsent‚Äù a replacement. I waited 2 weeks and it never came. I even called the post office questioning the whereabouts. When I reached out they had no idea what happened‚Ä¶. Re-sent another card and I‚Äôm going on week 2 now where I can‚Äôt use it because Chime is having technical issues with the chip reader. My employer direct deposits are never early and usually end up on the day of normal pay (Friday‚Äôs). My spot me limit has been stuck at $40 for a year now. Not only that but I have had a pending transaction which was cancelled by the merchant and a week later it hasn‚Äôt been reflected in my account. It still shows as pending. That‚Äôs $75 I still don‚Äôt have. Customer service NEVER responds; you‚Äôll wait days later and then have to send multiple follow ups. Once I get my next direct deposit from my employer which is coming up soon, I‚Äôm immediately switching to Empower or Albert. I‚Äôve had enough. Chime is the absolute WORST ‚Äúbanking company.‚Äù

Update: they settled a transaction for an incorrect amount then disabled my card once it went back and forth between the correct amount. 

SCAM. WATCH OUT. DON‚ÄôT USE THIS BANK.",1,2022-01-22 05:38:49
"Chime is the best bank out there right now. Absolutely no hassle or stress. When issues have come up, like fraudulent charges, they got back to me immediately...and replenished my account BEFORE they investigated so that I wasn‚Äôt left penniless. Check deposits and cash deposits are super easy.  Customer service is almost immediate. I‚Äôve lost my card and damaged another; they sent me replacements in less than a week. They have lots of rewards and sweepstakes and fun stuff happening all the time. And they fronted so many people‚Äôs stimulus checks! How nice! I‚Äôm a HUGE FAN and honestly will never go back to traditional banking. Ever. Oh! And if you ever overdraft they will cover it, plus $25!! Then you can tip them or not. No fee! Other banks charge $35-45 each time you overdraft, and for each pending charge. So you can end up hundreds of dollars in the negative before you get paid again. Not with Chime. They got you. AND I HAVE A CREDIT CARD AND SAVINGS ACCOUNT CONNECTED AND MANAGED SEAMLESSLY WITH MY CHECKING ACCOUNT. I want to hug Chime. LOVE CHIME. Chime for the win! Chime for life!",5,2020-05-23 20:23:43
"I absolutely love Chime! Opening an account was one of the best things I‚Äôve done. My two favorite things about chime:  1. The round up feature that automatically rounds your transaction to the nearest dollar and puts the remainder in your savings account. You don‚Äôt even realize it‚Äôs happening until you have a good amount of money in your savings account that you didn‚Äôt physically put in there. 2. GETTING PAID EARLY!!!! Yes, it‚Äôs true! You do get paid early! Depending on your employer you may get paid one day early or even two!! Chime has made it very simple to get a direct deposit form/find you account & routing numbers. You also get $50 for referring someone who receives a direct deposit total of $200 in 60 days... which is pretty easy. Your referral gets $50 too! There‚Äôs ATMs literally EVERYWHERE that you can grab cash out without any fees. You can also get cash back at most stores as well. I highly recommend getting a Chime account. I have no complaints whatsoever, only positive things to say! Oh and it‚Äôs FREE!!!",5,2019-05-18 05:38:40
"I‚Äôve had a few different bank accounts & I thought this account would be simple because it‚Äôs online, but no it‚Äôs the worst I‚Äôve had the account for about 2 weeks and I‚Äôve only had reliable access for a few days because almost every day there‚Äôs a service issue. Next they still have yet to send my debit card so I can‚Äôt access my money and they have not given me any feasible way to access it within the next 24 hours the only option I have is to wait for another week for my card to arrive which is ridiculously long especially because if I wanted to order a card replacement it would only take 3-5 business days with is backwards how is a replacement card able to arrive before my first original card. I would definitely not recommend this company at all, the way they control their company it seems like a scam, hopefully my card will arrive soon so I can get all my money and close the account immediately
Update: My Card was supposed to arrive today and it did not which I expected now I have to wait another week to have access to my money because I needed to order a replacement card this is the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had in my life, and the company does not car please save yourself the trouble",1,2019-10-25 22:54:03
For me there are always pros and cons in every situation. do your research. For me Chime has been so far a life changing experience. I have not been able to have a traditional bank. Most do their banking with traditional banks. Just know Chime does not have a physical location so at times you have to think outside the box. My experience with Chime app has been excellent. I personally refer most people to join and get an account with Chime. I have only once told a person to cancel or not get a Chime account. That was solely because after hearing about them and the way they bank and credit cards they have it just didn‚Äôt make sense for them to have one. They didn‚Äôt need it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.but for me and my situation‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I did. My only regret is not getting it earlier. Then I would have more of an aged history with Chime. I‚Äôm currently working on building my credit which is something that always confused me. Chime has gone me on the right track. See you all at the top,5,2024-10-09 21:09:50
As a single mom on a tight budget I am very appreciative of Chime and their ‚ÄúSpot me‚Äù feature. I can ‚Äúoverdraft‚Äù a certain amount every week with absolutely NO FEES. Which is a lovely thing that they give back since they‚Äôre probably making a killing in interest anyway so it works out (for me anyway) I do like the ‚ÄúMy pay‚Äù feature that also lets you ‚Äúborrow‚Äù a certain amount for a small fee of $2. The only thing they should fix is showing exactly how much you owe chime when you use both features in one place. It‚Äôs kind of confusing to have to look at 2 different places and at 1st I thought the amount in red was what I owed in total. A BIG surprise when payday hit and it was more then I thought. A but of advice: ONLY use both features in the same pay period IN EMERGENCY and if you know you have the funds to pay it back cuz it‚Äôs EASY to get caught up quick & end up owing more then your paycheck. Either way they‚Äôre both great tools for ppl in a crunch. üëçüèº,5,2024-09-19 09:14:39
"I seriously love chime! As a person who works super long hours and can‚Äôt get to a normal M-F 9-5 bank, chime is super helpful. I can just pop in a store and deposit some money instead of having to rearrange my whole schedule. Their customer service is also super helpful. Anytime I‚Äôve had to talk to them they have been amazing and fast. Mobile checks are always ready within 2-3 hours instead of 1-3 days and it‚Äôs so simple to use. I also love that they have a copy of your debit card right on the app instead of having to dig through my purse to find it as well as all direct deposit information. The getting paid 2 days early is also amazing and very convenient. I‚Äôm about to start the credit builder and will get my card shortly but I‚Äôve had friends that have really helped their credit with it and they‚Äôre so happy. Overall please, I wish deposits could be a little higher and not have a 24 hour limit but it‚Äôs not awful. Definitely get chime if you haven‚Äôt!",5,2022-05-05 14:29:24
"Read the new chime credit builder terms carefully!! They made HUGE quiet changes to the program. Before whatever $$ you freely moved over and spent was your balance and payment. That was it.  Now they report a cumulative total of all $$ moved onto CB card as the balanced owed and are now enforcing monthly payments to bring this balance back to the cumulative total. Meaning, you have to pay back (yourself) anything you‚Äôve spent from the money you moved over. I know what you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúHmm sounds like a regular secured credit card to me?‚Äù Because it is. The issue: the credit builder program was never ran that way until sometime in Oct 2022 or Fall 2022. I noticed new late payments and high balances reported on my credit report. Which is HORRIBLE!!! This is a credit building program and they are tanking my credit score all because of these new changes. You would think they would be loud and relentless about announcing these type of changes and updates since failure to change your spending habits or behaviors would result in the most damaging type of negative credit report marks. But no‚Ä¶they don‚Äôt care about the consumers of a product supposedly built to ‚Äúhelp them‚Äù in the first place. BEWARE!!!",1,2023-02-16 11:37:55
"I absolutely love Chime! I‚Äôve had a few B&M banks in the past and they‚Äôve never been for me, with a fee for everything and a charge for little things, it‚Äôs was a nightmare for me. I went without a bank for a couple years and then I found Chime! They have been by far the best banking experience I‚Äôve had and not having a B&M bank is absolutely no problem in fact I like it better, everything I do on my account is in my hand and there‚Äôs no fees for the little things, in fact there no fees at all! Unless I use an out-of-network ATM, which isn‚Äôt a huge deal because I‚Äôm not being charge for everything else. Basically, I get my paycheck 2 days early, I can transfer my cash to wherever without a charge and SpotMe is AMAZING! Oh and also.... Chime Credit Builder! I can build credit using this card almost like a secured credit card and there was none of the hoops to jump through and again NO FEES, just transfer from my existing account and use the card like a credit card.... it‚Äôs that simple! Thank you, Chime!!",5,2020-08-23 18:21:27
"I uploaded this app because my daughter told me about it and how she thought it was better than any other app well big mistake. I thought at first when I downloaded it it was ok well I was wrong. I deposited 2 checks which went smoothly but I went to deposit my stimulus check and I didn‚Äôt have a pen to write for chime deposit only so I did it with a pencil. 2 days went by I get an email saying I have to do it with a pen so I erased the pencil and held back writing it in pen and went to deposit a commission check I received from my employer and it said I exceeded my bank deposit limit mind you I only deposited 2 checks one for $4 something and the other one for $200. So I emailed them and they told me I was blocked from depositing any checks because Due to previous check deposit rejections, mobile check deposit is no longer available in your account. Mind you the only check that was rejected was my stimulus check because I wrote it in pencil. So I‚Äôm deleting it just beware when opening this account...",5,2020-05-13 21:59:56
"Update: changed my review to four stars. Would have been three but they‚Äôve expanded support for other banks since my last review. Disappointed that you can‚Äôt do a 10% automatic savings on direct deposits lower than $500, I don‚Äôt have my entire check deposited to Chime, so that will never be an option for me. More importantly though,  I‚Äôm extremely disappointed you can‚Äôt mobile deposit checks from other bank accounts that you own as a way of transferring money. No other bank account I‚Äôve owned has had that restriction. To send money from my other checking account would be 1-5 business days to verify the account and then probably another few days for the money to transfer. I hope they change this.

I love getting my paycheck early and the round up feature, but it's not compatible with a lot of banks and apps. I can't link it with my local credit union. Stash, venmo, PayPal all say it's not supported so it's kind of hard to use it as your main checking account. Hopefully they expand their support with other institutions soon.",4,2018-01-29 23:14:17
"I can‚Äôt believe that I was left hanging not only once, but TWICE by Chime‚Äôs lousy customer service misrepresenting the company. What‚Äôs worse is that no matter what they tell you, no body is held accountable and they say they‚Äôre ‚Äúsorry‚Äù?!‚Äî well, sorry won‚Äôt put food in my mouth for a laughable $500 check that my new job gave me as an advance. It‚Äôs only funny because although you were able to verify that I had already received a direct deposit from the exact same company that a (pre-printed) business check from my job, that indicated was an ‚ÄúAdvance‚Äù, you still decide to hold it for 2 weeks?!?! It defeated the purpose of depositing the check! I was getting paid sooner than when you were releasing it!! I have NEVER heard of an institution or entity ever holding someone‚Äôs $500 check for 2 weeks?! The rep lied just to get me off the phone. He promised that they would release the remainder of the check the following Monday. I was misled and after calling back, I was basically told to go screw myself by a manager that didn‚Äôt have the decency to at the very least speak up when having an adult conversation with someone. BE AWARE of this joke of a company. If you‚Äôre someone that wants to be taken seriously. Try another, better bank.",1,2019-05-23 01:14:45
"I‚Äôve very disappointed to have to write a bad review for this bank seeing as i have been with them since 2018! I had to update my password because as a person does i forgot it, and i have been locked out of my account ever since. Even after verifying my phone number, my ID, and I even had to upload a picture of myself. It will give me this whole process of verifying and it‚Äôll have me change my password and then it will immediately log me out. Every time i attempt to login using my updated password it will have me repeat the whole process and log me out! I‚Äôm extremely frustrated with the customer service, they haven‚Äôt been much help. They‚Äôve asked me to delete the app and reinstall, which I have done and I even tried logging in on MULTIPLE devices and I fall into the trap of that process again. All of the years I have been with this bank I have never had an issue with them, besides when they went offline years ago, even then they were able to fix it, in what seemed to be a timely manner. I feel like I‚Äôm not being taken seriously! This is a bank which people survive on! There should be urgency to find a resolution when there is a problem!",1,2023-01-09 17:10:22
"I‚Äôve been banking with chime for about 2 years and initially loved it. In January, however, several fraudulent charges popped up on my account. I disputed the charges and my dispute was rejected within 2 hours. After unsuccessfully trying to reach someone through the app I decided to call customer service. Finding that number itself was even difficult and when I finally googled it the first search result wasn‚Äôt even chime it was some scam company. When I finally reached someone they offered to have screenshots of their investigation sent to me. I agreed to do that before reopening the dispute. A week later they send me an email that‚Äôs literally just the form indicating what answers I had submitted for the dispute and no explanation: I call back and reopen the dispute and again it is denied, this time not even 20 minutes later. I ask for screenshots they send me the same thing again. There‚Äôs a huge language barrier already when dealing with their customer service agents and no higher up to talk to.  No one in the dispute department to talk to, because the computer determines the outcome.  I moved my direct deposit to a different bank and deleted the app. They don‚Äôt care at all.",1,2024-03-05 14:59:02
"Where to start. I‚Äôve been with chime for a long time now but decided to change banks. Why? Because over the years somehow several people have gotten ahold of my chime card and have used it. (No I didn‚Äôt use it as gas pumps or anywhere else where my info might have gotten stolen). Not only that but a few times charges were made and customer service actually told me it was an error on their end and reversed it! And finally, their customer service through email are nothing but bot replies. They never actually read what you type. They recently closed my credit builder account because I hadn‚Äôt used it in awhile. They claim I OWE them money on my credit builder, however I haven‚Äôt made any purchases using it in a long time, also, I had it set up to where I could ONLY make purchases if I had that amount of money ON my card. Sooo yea. Emailed customer service only for them to tell me about the credit builder card. Twice. Then the other email was saying they were sad I wanted to close my account. Umm no where did I say I WANTED to close it. I was asking WHY my credit builder was closed. Again, BOT responses with zero info relating to my actual question. Thanks for no help Bharat (I think his name was).",1,2022-12-10 04:39:54
"‚Äúi don‚Äôt write reviews‚Äù; proceeds to write one. 
for chime, i HAVE to tho. this bank is easily the best mobile banking system to get your hands on. they make it incredibly easy to save money with the round up feature, literally don‚Äôt even notice those transactions. upon opening an account and making your first direct deposit, they give you a base limit of $20 that you can overdraft until you get paid again. it‚Äôs genuinely the little things they think about. the app runs so smoothly, my only complaint being how it‚Äôll automatically switch you from dark mode to light mode. but that‚Äôs such a cosmetic and minute detail it‚Äôs only worth mentioning because that‚Äôs the ONLY issue i run into with chime. they even give you a map with places closest to you to pull money out of an atm for free. y‚Äôall i swear they‚Äôve thought of it all and i CANNOT recommend chime enough!!! please consider switching banks completely because you won‚Äôt regret it!!",5,2024-05-08 09:47:18
"This is the best app/service to honestly be created. I was skeptical at first but Chime has the best perks I‚Äôve ever experienced. It feels like Chime was created by someone who was so tired of these banks and other money services screwing us over that they chose to create their own app/service that had all the features we wish for. You get access to your money 2-3 days before your direct deposit day. Chime can spot you up to $200 (haven‚Äôt used that yet) and no overdraft fees. You can send money to people (slightly like cashapp). It has a credit-building and savings feature. You can track your credit as well and view your recurring bills. Chime has honestly been a great experience and we need to protect this gold mine at all costs. Hopefully they don‚Äôt join forces with anyone else because that‚Äôs usually when things go south. But if the quality of the app starts diminishing, I will pull my review down and will give you an update.",5,2023-09-17 13:46:20
"I love this app! I work at a bank and have a few accounts here and there so I‚Äôve worked with a couple different interfaces and platforms. Some banks spend good money on their mobile apps and it shows - whether you think that‚Äôs important or not is up to you - and I love being able to do so much on apps now. 
People often complain about security with finances and technology but let‚Äôs be reasonable; crime is always increasing whether it‚Äôs physically or digitally. You can secure your accounts with every bell and whistle and someone will still find a way to steal your identity. I feel like banks take a lot of heat for the inevitable in a technological world - sure, you can refuse the technology, but your accounts are still out there. It‚Äôll just take you longer to find out what‚Äôs happened. 
To wrap this mini rant up - I love the capabilities this app offers and *knock on wood* I‚Äôve had yet to have an issue. Though I have heard Chime has pretty good customer service too!",5,2023-09-09 04:04:05
"Chime is hands down the best bank I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôve had 5 different bank accounts in the past and I‚Äôve had issues with all of them that caused me to close my accounts out, mostly due to my account being over drafted, even though I was suppose have have protection against being over drafted. Chime‚Äôs Spot Me feature is amazing, it literally has helped me out more times than I can count. Being able to receive $5 temporary $5 boosts sent by other Chime users is super dope. Also the fact you can instantly send money to other Chime users, Cashapp style is pretty bomb as well. But my favorite feature with Chime is getting paid 2 days early. My job pays weekly, and it pays every Friday morning for everyone else, but I kept my paycheck around Noon every Wednesday around Noon. Also, even though Chime doesn‚Äôt have their own ATM‚Äôs, they have plenty of free ATM‚Äôs at every CVS, Walgreens, 7/11, and and a lot of other places like select grocery stores or Costco.",5,2022-07-02 10:24:13
"I‚Äôve been through so many banks. And they are were terrible. My balances where never right. Always catching up from days prior. Overdraft fees. The list goes. And then I heard about chime. I was skeptical at first Bc of it being online.  

This. Is. The. Best! My account is not only always accurate but I get a text as soon as the cards swiped with what my new balance is. Not only do they not charge over draft fees. But they spot you up to 200$ free of charge. That has came in handy for me more times than I can count 

If I had one thing for them to improve on it would be the depositing of money. They charge you 5$ for every 500$ and there‚Äôs a limit. So when I went to deposit 3000$ it would of took 6 separate transactions and 30$ to do. Which is insane but I don‚Äôt usually deposit money. So I don‚Äôt care that much Bc of all the other benefits. That‚Äôs the only complaint I have. Other than that please never change",5,2021-08-03 11:30:04
"My personal information was compromised and my account was hacked the very moment I found out my account was hacked I notified them and sent them the necessary information to get my account unlocked. they said it would take up to two days I waited the two days. now I‚Äôm on three days and I still can‚Äôt get into my account! the account is no longer locked but my password is still not working & the password change link is not coming to my email and I‚Äôm getting the runaround every time I call telling me to wait for emails from support and provide additional information that I‚Äôve already provided multiple times!! Can‚Äôt get any real response I‚Äôm just continually hearing the same nonsense over and over again whenever this issue is resolved I‚Äôm withdrawing my funds in closing my account! I haven‚Äôt been able to eat, wash my clothes, pay bills, put gas in my car for 3 days because of this great inconvenience! It seems so ridiculous to me that someone was able to hack my account so easily and Chime allow them to get in but they won‚Äôt let the actual owner (who‚Äôs proven their identity aka me) of the account get access in a timely manner! I‚Äôm done with this bull!",1,2021-11-18 21:49:59
I have been seeing ads for this on Facebook and Instagram for a while and never really cared since I had a Chase college account and for most of my banking life I had Chase wherever I went and one down the block where I lived. I moved and now while it‚Äôs not a far walk it‚Äôs the only one near me and now is charging me fees. I figured I would try out chime since I remembered seeing these ads. I read the reviews and stuff about chime and most would good but some were pretty bad like not getting referred bonus and some other stuff. Never had any issues and I got my bonus like literally the same time as my direct deposit of over $200 ( first over $200 you‚Äôll get it after two business days in the fine print ). I get my check about a day early which is nice as well. Also has an optional savings account where you can round up charges and it‚Äôs put in there. I also have a lot more banks I can take cash out near me and around where I work now as well which is nice ( mostly 7-11‚Äôs),5,2018-09-05 16:34:40
Worst experience with a bank thank God I kept my old bank just to try this one out. No customer service at all it‚Äôs like everyone is a robot that copies and pastes their responses no help when you need it. There was an unauthorized charge to my account and I still don‚Äôt have my money they make you jump through hoops no help from them you have to contact the merchant for a refund and if they don‚Äôt refund you Chime will open a claim and take 90 days to give you YOUR money!! Then they say your account was closed in accordance with their terms blah blah they do this just not to refund you YOUR MONEY that they authorized someone to take out!! It‚Äôs FRAUD BEWARE The new card takes forever to arrive you have to pay to deposit YOUR OWN MONEY because they have no other option. You can link a bank but hope you don‚Äôt need the money you transfer right away NOPE it will take 3-5 business days to transfer from Chime to your bank. It‚Äôs terrible the ONLY good thing I have to say was getting my check a day in a half early Wednesday night by midnight to be exact. You don‚Äôt ever speak to someone it‚Äôs all done through chat and they respond at THEIR OWN CONVENIENCE. STAY AWAY STAY AWAY !! Or sign up at your OWN RISK & you‚Äôll be back here writing a review of your own,1,2019-04-26 13:50:52
"Hi friends! I love this app so much! From the start of setting up my app to inputting all my information, I love having my chime account, I feel more independent and in control of my finances!! I thank you from the bottom of my heart for allowing me this opportunity to build my credit as well as purchase anything I want at my convenience. I currently have joint accounts with my husband, but you have my own is something really nice. Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to grow, and I appreciate the guidance!!! I recommend this app 1000%!! I feel more in control of my finances..Thank you chime I will be passing on my experience with chime to many many friends that I have and colleagues!! Great job CHIME! I appreciate each and everyone of you looking forward to many many years with this company!!

"I‚Äôve been using their ‚Äúcredit card‚Äù as a way to improve my credit. I use it solely for deposits at rental agencies, I keep the same deposit on there. It looks like I have a legit CC im paying on. One day I wake up to chime LOGGING ME OUT, telling me there‚Äôs ‚ÄúUNUSUAL ACTIVITY DETECTED‚Äù??? And to upload a SELFIE. I take my protection seriously and don‚Äôt hand out my government ID or send ‚Äúselfies‚Äù. Just because. This is absolutely despicable and low. I‚Äôm withdrawing my money indefinitely and never using them again. Listen when I say you simply cannot trust chime. I am a person that‚Äôs had zero issues for 6 years but you simply can‚Äôt trust them. And a lot of people have been victim to their rolling scam. Closing random peoples accounts so they can attempt to steal. Then they start new with the next random batch of people. Get your money out NOW. 
UPDATE:: This was their snarky response to my formal complaint. ‚ÄúIn your complaint, you stated that you lost access to your Chime account and you wish to regain access to your account and funds. Chime is a financial technology company, not a bank‚Äù. SO CHIME WILL TELL YOU THEY‚ÄôRE NOT A REAL BANK, basically mocking you for trusting them. Don‚Äôt be one of their fools.",1,2025-03-25 01:57:45
"#1, you can‚Äôt really use this app with cash app or link your account because this is an online banking app so your options become limited if you open an account with them. #2, you can tell the support team doesn‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre doing when it comes to issues with your account and they read off instructions from their screen, also they cannot answer questions that are too specific because again they are using instructions to help you. #3, they cannot detect many issues like fraud, a transaction made twice, etc. And it will be a huge frustration and a long time trying to fix anything really other than the basic things like giving a direct deposit number. #4, My main problem with this company is that they do not contact the merchant about a transaction if there were any issues or any security concerns, they go based off of what you yourself can provide and sometimes that is just not enough. You can see the potential but they do not know what they‚Äôre doing, chime is disappointing, please stay with another bank that has physical locations if you can.",1,2024-07-09 20:09:36
"Please choose another bank so you do not have to endure the nightmare I am currently in. Two days after opening my account, the $1,000 I deposited was drained to .92. All of the information was hacked and changed on my online account so I can no longer access it to see the transactions myself. I‚Äôve been on the phone for three days with multiple customer service representatives and not a single person has been able to help me or provide me with any answers. I have been transferred to multiple different departments and have wasted hours speaking to people that have brushed me off and have not provided me with any assistance whatsoever. I was also informed that they are unable to shut my card off because since they use digital cards on their app, the person who has hacked my account is able to simply turn my card back on and continue to use it if there are any funds deposited. Since I had one transaction pending before realizing my account was compromised, the person who hacked my account then used the $200 deposited as well, completely draining my account for a second. Everything about this experience has been a complete nightmare to say the least.",1,2022-11-11 15:45:55
"I absolutely love chime! It has every pro you can ask for in a bank. Having a checking account I get paid 2 days earlier and if it‚Äôs late they will notify me. (Only during bank holidays, however I still receive it early.) Having a savings I am able to set up to automatically have a percentage of my check deposited each pay period. 4 bonus features that I personally believe separates chime from the rest are; 

Credit builder- allows you to also send a percentage of your direct deposit, is a secured credit card that has a metal texture, is connected directly to Experian which will give you a accurate score. 

Spot me- back up overdraft safety blanket for those hard times. You start off with $20 and quickly receive increases as your direct deposit remains consistent. You can also receive a increase if you invite someone with your link and they join. 

Pay anyone- YES! It‚Äôs similar to zelle, you can pay anyone directly from your account. They receive a link, input their card or bank accounts info and the funds are loaded instantly. So no more 3rd party apps are involved. 

Easy to navigate throughout the app- The entire app is self explanatory. They make the steps simple with filing any disputes, locking your card, transferring funds from any of the 3 different account types, and customer service responds fast. 

Overall, do yourself a favor and download the chime app today! It‚Äôs totally worth it.",5,2023-09-09 13:52:34
"I am so impressed by this bank, I usually don‚Äôt take the time to do reviews. My father in law and I are on the same phone plan and we noticed a man from California had access to and was using our cards for online purchases. We know it was the same man because it listed his name and there was a phone number that of course did not work. So I wonder if he somehow hacked our phone plan? I told Customer Service about this and the transactions that I could see. The representative, like every time I call, was very polite. They took the time to go through all my transactions and refund me everything this man stole. It was $136. They had done all this in about a week. I can‚Äôt think of another bank that would have done that so promptly and I am very thankful. There are a couple annoyances from time to time but to know they have your back and will do what they can to keep your money safe is absolutely worth it.",5,2024-06-10 19:52:43
"I originally went with Chime to get paid 2 days earlier. It‚Äôs their main selling point that three quarters of their client base was sold on. After having chime for almost 2 years I have to say I‚Äôm happy for the most part. Any time I want to make a cash deposit it costs me $5. Despite Chime saying they accept $1000 per day, the vendors that actually take the cash usually only accept $500 a day. I was given a large sum of cash from family and I had to spend a week depositing it and about $100 in fees for depositing it. Say I have $5000 in my account and I find a car I want to buy... it‚Äôs impossible since there‚Äôs a daily limit of $1000 at ATM‚Äôs, not to mention most ATM‚Äôs only let you take out $200 max per visit. Have fun paying your rent via money order. You‚Äôll stand at the ATM for 10 minutes. The upside is that there‚Äôs no overdraft. Basically, if there‚Äôs not enough cash in the account it won‚Äôt even let the debit go through. I love getting paid two days earlier, but I always regret not having a physical location I can bank with. My suggestion is to just put up with the extra 2 days to get your paycheck.",3,2019-03-20 01:58:37
"I‚Äôve been with chime for over a year. I loved them until one day I got a text asking if I tried to make a 400$ purchase in Hong Kong I text back No and immediately check my account. Over 500$ has been stolen out my account with apple , go puff and even restaurant purchases from places like Philly and NY. Of course I call them and handle this like normal (a smaller dispute has been resolved before about a year ago) so no problem right ? WRONG. They deny my claim without any notification so I waited about a month before I called them and they told me the denied it . I reopened and they DENIED AGAIN! so now they want me to PLEAD MY CASE WITH EVIDENCE in an email that still may or may not end in me getting MY HARD EARNED MONEY BACK FOR. It‚Äôs been 3 months since this has started and I ain‚Äôt gonna lie I‚Äôm NOT rich 500$ was a HUGE chunk of what I needed , I don‚Äôt have that kind of money to just GIVE AWAY. just save yourself the hassle and get an ACTUAL bank account  with a real branch",5,2023-03-27 20:40:22
"I‚Äôve always used online banking, but never had an actual online checking account. I recently decided that I needed a second account for the gig work I started doing since Covid. I did a little research and decided to go with Chime. I put my baby down for a nap prepared for a long and annoying process that comes with any financial stuff. I literally downloaded the app, they asked maybe 3-4 questions, and not even 3 minutes later I had my checking account number and routing, and a temporary (picture of) my debit card that they said will arrive in a week. Then I see an option to open a savings account (which I‚Äôve never even had) and 2 seconds later, boom, I have a savings account too. I don‚Äôt ever write reviews; I have about a hundred other things I could put my time too. But honestly I really felt like Chime deserved the time it takes for me to write this. This was hands down the best, most efficient, easiest, pleasant ‚Äúbanking‚Äù experience I‚Äôve ever had.",5,2020-12-04 21:19:11
"I‚Äôm in my 50s and I‚Äôve had about 9 different bank accounts, with several different banks. My daughter recommended that I sign up for Chime. I was reluctant to do so, because I have a checking and savings account with a Credit Union, and didn‚Äôt think I needed another account. 
The reality is I didn‚Äôt NEED another account, but I couldn‚Äôt be happier or more impressed with a bank, than I am with Chime! I absolutely LOVE Chime! I would recommend this bank to anyone! Young or older, you aren‚Äôt going to find a better banking service than Chime. 
The customer service is impeccable, the App is flawless, and the utter ease of using the app and debit card are priceless! They even help you build your savings by rounding up your purchase total, depositing it to your savings from spending account, making it easier and painless to save! You want for nothing more being a customer of Chime. I‚Äôve thanked my millennial daughter several times for her referral, and have zero regrets signing up, only a lot of gratitude!",5,2020-03-17 14:39:56
"Initially downloaded the app looking through ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù apps after getting Venmo and Zelle so I could send friends money. 

Wasn‚Äôt really looking for online banking, just wanted something I could put money on every once in a while. 

I decided to have my paycheck direct deposited. (Honestly because I wanted the black metal card I saw in my email). I shared it to my friends but didn‚Äôt get the card. 

However I ended up falling in love with the simplicity Chime has for its customers. Love that I can pay bills with a check for free without having to purchase a check book, I love Chime messages me everyday to let me know my balances, most of all i LOOVE getting paid 2 DAYS EARLY üòçüòÅ the modern way I bank because of Chime has me feeling some type of way üòâ. 

Since my first direct deposit I have actually canceled my accounts at my other banks and now only use Chime. I love it being totally online but having the option to get cash if I really need it, without having to go into a dreaded bank and stand in a seemingly never ending line just to feel judged because the person at the counter can see I only have 23cents in my account. NOT ANYMORE!! I get paid before EVERYONE, I can add cash to my account at retail stores, it automatically puts money in my saving for all deposits and every time I use my car. 

I seriously tell everyone about it when I have the chance. Specially when we talk about payday because I can brag about I get my check two days early.",5,2019-03-09 19:19:42
"Me myself haven‚Äôt had any issues thus far banking with chime but my fianc√© got utterly screwed by them.. she had her account hacked and someone went on a spending spree racking up $400+ so we notice the spending and closed the card out and request another card and opened a dispute in hope to get her money back they tell us it can take up to 3 months to get any word on the issue and 1 month after waiting we get an email saying they will not help at all! My fianc√©s account was taken over and she still had her physical card on hand! Chime is not secure at all. They do not care about helping with anything it was a huge run around on the phone as well. So I think I will be closing my account as well because of all of this‚Ä¶ if you have chime I wouldn't put any money in your account you can‚Äôt afford to lose. DO NOT PUT ALL YOUR MONEY IN THIS BANK!!! If anything take advantage of the credit builder credit card and leave it at that and keep your account balance super low, this is not a good bank whatsoever I still can‚Äôt believe they basically told us to kick rocks when money was stolen with no fault of our own it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous!",1,2023-08-25 22:21:09
"If you are struggling or not to get a bank come check out chime! I have had Chime over 5 years and I am still with them to this day! Chime is amazing online Banking that will help you out in so many ways. They have a way for you to build your credit. No late fees even if you go over. They also have Spot me if needed. Once you set your direct deposit you will get paid two days early and spot me up to 90 dollars. You can send up to 4 boosts me to your friends and family each boosts me is $5 dollars. After doing all of those steps you will have extra 110 to help you out if needed, and don‚Äôt for get to tip after. Tipping goes a long way for the next person that might need it or yourself in the future. It is also easy to transfer money to other account cash app and all. Don‚Äôt forget you can also transfer money even fast chime to chime with in seconds. This has been one of the best experience I ever had with a bank",5,2023-09-16 11:41:17
I was looking into a secured credit card and found Chime. I thought this was. Great way to build credit and open an additional bank account. Everything seemed easy and I was excited about setting this up. As quick as it was to set up and get started it soon became a nightmare and frustrating when I realized I needed a direct deposit to set up my secured credit card after I set up my Chime bank account. I don‚Äôt have direct deposit through any pay roll and I am self employed so there is no pay roll company I use. I called customer service and though I can easily get through to a person no one has been able to help me transfer my money from Chime back to my Bank of America account. I have to wait to access a bank card that‚Äôs being mailed to me before I can transfer my money? It all feel like a bunch of bull. Thank god I can handle surviving without the money I put into Chime but honestly I am not happy with the fact that I can‚Äôt get a secured credit card and I can‚Äôt even get my money back in a timely manor. I do not recommend Chime. In theory it‚Äôs a nice idea but the reality is this is not meant for everyone. Think twice before you set this up and give them your money.,1,2021-04-04 22:09:53
"Chime is a joke. I signed up for it on 3/1 thinking that it was a good idea and that it would help me separate my finances, but as soon as I tried to connect my bank it wouldn‚Äôt work. I tried every day for a week until my card actually arrived on 3/7 and it never connected. They use Plaid in order to connect the banks and on another app I got after signing up for chime I was able to connect just fine. I contacted Chime and the rep on the phone wasn‚Äôt able to help me, he just told me to delete and reinstall the app which did nothing, so he told me to email support. That tired out to be a waste of time, as Angel from Chime made it very apparent that he just copied and pasted his very generic responses from some guide Chime has, as not a single solution he suggested made any type of sense in terms of how it would help. I then emailed back to cancel my account, again of course to generic emails to indicate they have no intention of helping and I‚Äôm just out of luck, and have canceled my account without ever swiping it ONCE. My card was literally active for less that 8 hours. They advertise as being easy to use and tout their customer service as being amazing but it is not. What a waste of time.",1,2021-03-09 11:14:25
"I‚Äôve of course had other mobile banking cards and Chime has been my absolute favorite. Getting paid two days early and occasionally three days early is the best especially when I really need it. Chime sends daily balance alerts making sure you‚Äôre aware of what you have in your account and the overdraft coverage of up to $200 is a great feature that gives you peace of mind also and no fees! Chime also has a sending money to anyone feature that has surely been one of my greatest conveniences it‚Äôs hassle free and the money is received instantly. Chime comes highly recommended, you won‚Äôt regret choosing them. Check them out seriously, no doubt there may be some features I‚Äôve failed to mention, they seriously have a lot to offer, at least look into it to see if it‚Äôs better for you than what you currently have and if you‚Äôre not currently using a mobile app Chime is easily your best choice.",5,2023-09-14 14:41:39
"I‚Äôve had chime almost for a year now and have had zero problems, concerns, obstacles or anything of the above. My check comes early, I can over draft a few bucks which I love cause I do not like paying over draft fees or being able to even overdrafts. To be able of overdraft 20-30 bucks if needed and that‚Äôs it is ideal for me. I even have a credit card from them that has moved up my credit 55 points. And I love the card cause u only spend what u put on it so it‚Äôs like a debit card that can be used as a credit like the ones u can but, except it reports to your credit like a regular credit card. I do have a local bank I kept and keep a few bucks stashed in but I even have that one linked to my chime so I can move money back and forth between them two. But I prefer chime which is why all 3 of my jobs payroll sending to the chime. (1 full and 2 part time if your wondering‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not working 3 full time jobs)",5,2022-02-18 07:21:40
I guess with banking you have to determine who is better at one thing and worse at another. I genuinely like Chime they offer a lot of services from the convenience of your phone . I took 6 months to try them out without using their direct deposit services and I just drafted money into the account from a brick and mortar bank. No problems except their app and notifications I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled at least 4x now I allow 2 direct deposits to Chime my main one I‚Äôm going to have to wait for because fir over 2 weeks I don‚Äôt get my daily notifications so I can only trust them so much and will continue to use them partially until they become consistent as Chase and BOA with notifications also their savings acct interest rates are the lowest I‚Äôve ever seen but I think that compensates for their other services they offer gratis so I just keep 1/10 of my direct deposit in savings cause it won‚Äôt grow with this,5,2021-01-24 14:39:04
"To be quite honest, I was a skeptical at first. I have just had so many other issues with previous banks and accounts. Hidden fees, etc. that I decided to take a chance. Chime is actually one of the best decisions I ever made. It‚Äôs helped me raise my credit with the credit builder card, actually save money with the percentages it moves to your savings with every deposit and charge to the account. The referral bonus is amazing! Who doesn‚Äôt like free money, am I right? My direct deposit has no issues, and most convenient stores, Walgreens, etc, and Walmart do deposits so it‚Äôs honestly better than having to take a separate trip to a bank when you can go to Walmart or somewhere else and do your deposits and do your shopping all in the same beat if you have a hectic work schedule like I do. Chime is great, through and through and I will continue to refer people and use it myself for years to come!",5,2023-10-13 21:16:39
"The bank is fine, they have most modern online banking features and an ok APY for savings. The app works well. My problem is that I opened the chime credit card, and started using it for most things, as recommended by chime. It raised my score 13 points after a couple months, which seemed great. However, it then lowered my score by 20. The reason given is that my chime/ stride credit balance had increased. It‚Äôs showing that I ‚Äúowe‚Äù money, even though it says in the app that chime does not report usage, only on- time payments. There is no option to make it just pay the entire ‚Äúbalance‚Äù, instead it apparently only pays a small portion of the money you load each month. Makes no sense to me. Searching online, this happens to others frequently. A chime staff response on the Reddit thread regarding this issue was terrible and explained nothing. I stopped using the credit card, and would recommend researching more than I did before opening a chime account. There are a lot of people that say chime is great for them, and that‚Äôs awesome, but my experience has been poor.",2,2024-04-30 02:37:52
"So I had Arvest and Chime for many years until last year in early 2021 I got rid of my Arvest account and now solely use Chime. I cannot recommend this enough. NO FEES! That‚Äôs what got me. Even if you cannot let go of your original bank (like myself years ago) this is a fantastic secondary option. I am a Dasher for DoorDash and originally used this for that and paying bills. Cashing out at the end of my shift and having my money show up in my chime account within 2 seconds is the best. Also, getting paid up to 3 days early is legit. I‚Äôm paid fridays and mostly get paid Wednesday to Thursday. And even received my child tax credit earlier than some friends of mine. Also the boosting you can send to friends and have them send to you for your Spot Me balance comes in handy when you need it. This app and bank gets a 10/10 from me and this is year 5 for me. I also recently ordered my card for my credit builder. Definitely recommend.",5,2022-01-07 19:17:47
"I signed up years ago to get a tax refund direct deposit.. but I ended up not even using it. I got card in mail and had it in safe for years. I started seeing more commercials and hearing my friends rave about Chime. Plus my ‚Äúregular‚Äù bank was charging me tons of fees for the stupidest stuff. That is when I switched my direct deposit to Chime and haven‚Äôt looked back since. No fees people! Plus the spot me is awesome with no overdraft or overdrawn fees or whatever the big box banks called them. In addition to the spot me they loan out an extra $500 until payday. At first it was just $250 then it went up to $500. So then when your direct deposit comes in that amount just gets deducted. Chime truly is the next best thing to sliced bread‚Ä¶ I have converted so many people. (which usually you will get $100 for each new member- but I didn‚Äôt do the referral, ppl are extra careful when it comes to their money)
If you are not sure, just try it.",5,2024-09-22 21:42:20
"I decided to try chime out for direct deposit a couple of days ago. I had a paycheck direct deposited the next day, and realized I could not get it out because I have no card. I read on their app that transfers to other chime members are free and instant. I was also told the same thing by an employee on the phone. I tried to do the transfer on the app and It wouldn‚Äôt allow me bei had not activated my card. Fine. A customer service member told me I can still do the transfer, my friend and I each have to send an email with our photo ID and other pertinent information. We both sent the emails and waited an hour before I called again to see what was going on. They told me the people in that department seem to have gotten the emails but he said he would put a rush on the case. It has now been 6 hours and I haven‚Äôt heard a peep from chime. If you need money ASAP do NOT rely on this app to get it to you. I‚Äôve been told that netspend is much quicker and has an excellent overdraft protection program. If the money comes tomorrow I may update this review. If it doesn‚Äôt I‚Äôm pulling all my money out as soon as I get a card and closing the account. Do not advertise things that aren‚Äôt true instant is not a 24 hour wait.",1,2020-02-08 22:56:07
"Great bank for an online bank. Overdraft all that great helps out a lot. My pay is terrible. If you find yourself in a bind do not use it no better than a payday loan they randomly change it every paycheck giving you higher limits to borrow money and then without warning will change it $100 or more and screw you out of that money well thought out on there because it benefits them but screw you over because if you‚Äôre someone like me in my shoes that struggling it does nothing but hurt your ability to climb out of it and they keep you in trapped and even though you have $160 credit limit, they will only give you a couple dollars every day that you can withdraw from that after taking half of your check, yes it can be useful. If you‚Äôre trying to learn how to manage your money but by them taking that is hurting you more because now you can‚Äôt get the things done that you need to get done because they are withholding the money that they offer until they feel, like they want to give it to you do not use my pay",3,2024-11-22 23:41:14
"I have no complaints about the app itself, but dealing with customer service is an absolute nightmare! After ordering a credit builder card, I never received it in the mail, so I sent an email to customer service describing the problem. They replied that they had canceled my DEBIT card and would send a replacement. I got back in touch and another agent assured me that both new cards were on the way. That was over a month ago. I have since contacted support yet again and received the same canned/scripted response. Confirm your address, we‚Äôll send new card, blah blah blah. These ‚Äúagents‚Äù are either bots or people who don‚Äôt understand English, because I get nothing but the same repetitive answers and silly platitudes. But where are my cards?  (An unrelated issue, but why bother asking for a preferred name on my profile, when the customer service ‚Äúagents‚Äù insist on constantly and creepily addressing me by the legal name on the card?) üôÅ",5,2023-06-05 15:32:50
"I‚Äôve had Chime for over a year now, almost a year and a half, and they have been such a delight to work with. Now, my banking needs are rather simple - direct deposits a couple of times a month from work, credit card payments, and my balances are truthfully not very high. Nothing is too complicated, and so this bank and app is perfect for my simple needs. The app is so intuitive, I‚Äôve never had to directly reach out to customer support because it‚Äôs so easy to do anything. Someone stole my card info, and I could just go in the app, cancel my card, and get a new one. The thing that initially grabbed my attention for Chime was the high interest savings account. My old bank‚Äôs APY was 0.01%. and while initially nervous about the switch to an online-only bank, again, I‚Äôve had less issues with Chime than I had with my previous, nationwide bank with hundreds of in person branches. Highly recommend switching!",5,2022-10-10 20:22:32
"üåàHAPPY ENDING FIRSTüåà: Chime is AMAZING. They really have no fees, I can use BOA ATMs, I adore they‚Äôre frequent text alerts with purchases and your balance. You can‚Äôt overdraw (other than their complimentary ‚ÄúSpot Me‚Äù program). 
üò∞THE NIGHTMAREüò∞: After over 20 years with Bank of America, after thousands of dollars in check fees ‚Äúmonthly maintenance‚Äù fees, over draft frees, deception, frustration... I saw s Chime commercial and thought ‚ÄúWhat do I have to lose?‚Äù I had just come from a BOA location begging them to help me reverse 7 - $35 overdraft fees that were not my fault. I had been laid off my last paycheck was mailed not direct deposited; I deposited the check as soon as I realized just a few days after the fact. Something I‚Äôd never done, an honest mistake. I was sobbing. I was scared. On top of being without an income, I was $250 in the hole. I was I was a loyal customer for 23 years. She told me no. I was done.

"Many times I would give 5 stars but at times recently I‚Äôve had problems using it at POC terminals when I don‚Äôt have my card & try using my phone. Recently purchases I‚Äôve always made at 7/11 were denied as not valid items. Plus only place I can make a free deposit is too far to walk. I am really glad that Chime gave me back my emergency overdraft fund. It was gone for a period when I lost job & direct deposit. But I have transfers I can make from other bank. Unfortunately, Apple Pay is not compatible with an instant transfer. So I keep money I immediately need as Apple Cash & transfer rest to bank. If before 9AM EST then usually arrives in account by 5PM EST. Thanks Chime it is a way to transfer money to me my 80 year old Mother understands. We‚Äôve already stopped Venmo & PayPal too confusing for her. She understands Apple Cash. ü§£Plus when my nephew in another state was raising Toys For

"This was seriously the best banking experience ever. Ever. Had all my peeps sign up. They loved it. All of us needed to cash US treasury checks. Absolutely dreamy. Practically instant. Until one day, my fianc√© went to his app to cash his long awaited refund check from the irs, and he can‚Äôt. No mobile deposits unless you have direct deposit. What?!? I cashed 3 checks from the irs. My app gives me the option of mobile check deposit and asks which kind of check it is. His doesn‚Äôt even give him the option. Just leads him to sign up for direct deposit. We called customer service, the girl had no answer. No reason why. Even suggested we do some self pay from another account like it‚Äôs a direct deposit WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT ALLOWED AND STATES IT IN YOUR RULES so why this rep even suggested it also just whoa. Really bad. So yeah. Why. Why‚Äôd you have to ruin my favorite app ever. With the little funny emojis every day telling me my balance. Also, why the days and days waiting for a transfer from my big bank? Cash app it‚Äôs available immediately. You guys, a week. Boo!",3,2021-09-07 06:53:23
"I wanted to try Chime because I use eBay a lot and eBay just ended their contract with PayPal. I tried signing up for a Chime account, and my request was immediately declined saying that their services team wasn‚Äôt able to provide me with any information as to why. I decided to contact Chime via email explaining the situation and they basically told me the same thing, ‚Äúthe information your provided isn‚Äôt verifiable therefore you cannot open an account with Chime at this time‚Äù. Nothing about my informations should be unverifiable... I offered to send them a picture of my license or another form of verification and they just sent me the same automated response basically saying that they would refuse to offer me an account because their system isn‚Äôt able to verify the info I provided.
Thanks a lot Chime. Here‚Äôs a suggestion: if you have people trying to use your app and are willing to provide other forms of verification, enter it MANUALLY. Relying on an automated website to approve or decline information will clearly have its issues, and the fact that you‚Äôre not willing to even try to work around those issues when they arise is frustrating. That‚Äôs not how you run a company.",1,2021-03-02 20:49:51
"When I first became a Chime member. When I used the overdraft amount, and then the following month it got repaid and it used to ask to leave a tip. The tip was half the amount than it is now. I try to tip when I am able to but since I can‚Äôt spare to tip. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I am very grateful and appreciate the overdraft option it‚Äôs awesome! 
But now the lowest tip amount is twice then what it used to be. I‚Äôm in a bankruptcy right now and I am half way through it and money is so tight. The courts barely leave me enough money too live on. I don‚Äôt appreciate the tactics chime is using now. 
Chime says tipping is not required and that is how it keeps a no fee overdraft fee but if I don‚Äôt tip to keep it free I need to tip otherwise chime is going to have to start charging a fee. The other thing is that I should be the one to tip an amount I can afford not a preset amount. I would be able to tip  what I could afford then. 
I appreciate Chime and the awesome services they offer and provide but I feel very bad that I am not able to tip and show my appreciation sometimes. 
Thank you.",3,2023-10-04 21:07:13
"Terrible customer service. Their app/website is useless. I requested a new debit card on June 3rd through their app (which is how you‚Äôre supposed to do it) and on June 16th after reaching out to customer service again, I was informed that the new card request never went through. So now nearly 3 weeks later, I am still unable to access my funds because my old card is ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù and the new one hasn‚Äôt arrived yet. My only option is to transfer the money to another bank account (which still isn‚Äôt instant). This app/bank isn‚Äôt really worth the trouble.

1/9/18 Update: After having my card replaced THREE TIMES because of attempted fraudulent charges and not even using the account, today I got yet another notification that someone was attempting to use my card to spend $45 at Pizza Hut. I‚Äôm not sure how anyone could have gotten my card information because the card never left my house after it was delivered and activated. 

Do not use this service. Their customer service is awful and does nothing to solve your problems. If you‚Äôre looking for an online bank, I recommend trying one of the many others that are out there. Getting paid two days earlier is NOT worth the stress.",1,2019-01-09 21:51:26
"Chime is a life saver! I‚Äôm so appreciative for them. They have been nothing but help these last few years. They have helped build my credit, helped with money management and so many other things. Chime is so resourceful and have many tools that‚Äôll help you in real life. Honestly, you‚Äôre a fool if you don‚Äôt have Chime. The best online banking out there. Their only con used to be that they don‚Äôt have a physical bank that you can walk in. Now they even nipped that in the bud by allowing you to deposit your money at places like Walgreens for free. They even let you know what free atms are in your area so that you can withdraw without an issue. I seriously feel like Chime was made with me in mind and for that I‚Äôm forever loyal. If I had the opportunity I would do business with Chime on some partnership type stuff or maybe even just be endorsed by them.

I‚Äôve had chime for a few years now. So far the problems I‚Äôve had have been easily fixed with their 24/7 support team. The app has a bot that helps you but if you need an actual person talk you have to do is ask and you can message them or they can call you. Their atm‚Äôs are all over the place and moving money from one bank to another isn‚Äôt hard at all. I‚Äôve never been charged for a card I‚Äôve lost and it‚Äôs always been between 3-5 business days that I have received it. Within that time you can use the temporary card on your phone to pay for your goods. When you get a direct deposit you can go up to $200 in the negatives and never be charged a fee. Lastly my credit has shot up since I‚Äôve used their credit builder card that you use your own money like a debit card and it builds your credit with. I highly recommend chime and hope you enjoy it like I do!,5,2023-09-10 17:06:33
"I set up my debit card to this account to make a transfer into my bank instead but it will NOT allow me to whatsoever. Sure, it accepts my card with my bank but no transfer is allowed so I can‚Äôt do that to get my money out. In fact that was what I was trying to do because when I went to the store this morning I wasn‚Äôt able to pay with my virtual card- because it never had me set up a pin and there‚Äôs no option to add one- and stores require a pin for purchase. It was working fine a day ago, but now it doesn‚Äôt and I can‚Äôt pull money out of the account or use the card- I can‚Äôt access my money at all. I‚Äôve never had this much of an issue with a banking app before. I‚Äôve been going through circles this morning with this app just trying to get my money out so I can pay for gas of all things. There are plenty of other banking apps that work much easier and BETTER, i highly recommend going with another banking app so you don‚Äôt have to go through circles trying to pay for gas or whatever else you need or just trying to get access to your money in general.",1,2024-08-11 12:44:25
"Since the very beginning this bank has offered me unlimited amounts of opportunities. Because of this bank I have been able to survive through it ALL, literally.

It may seem a bit crazy because it‚Äôs not the first bank that comes in mind, but I kid you not, Chime is going in the right direction!! The masterminds behind the scenes really have the right idea and from what I‚Äôve experienced so far, I can tell that they do it all genuinely and with all of the right intentions. I have a couple of other bank accounts for obligated reasons, but this is my main account and I do not plan on changing that any time soon!

"This is the best bank I have ever had! Ok, so first off there‚Äôs no hidden fees, there‚Äôs nothing like maintenance fee, overdraft fee, or anything like that. The bank let‚Äôs you get your paycheck TWO days early! If you do overdraft, they have this feature called SpotMe, where they can spot you a certain amount of money before your card gets declined. There‚Äôs a saving account here too and it can take part of your paycheck for you towards your savings automatically! The bad thing is, if you wanna deposit money here it‚Äôs hard, you have to pay 4.99 to deposit money and you have to go to places like CVS. Also, I think it‚Äôs like 4.99$ every 100$, but I don‚Äôt deal with cash that much, so it doesn‚Äôt affect me. It has mobile deposit too and you can link your other bank to this bank too. Check wise they will mail a check out for you (I wish they would give us a checkbook tbh). Overall, I‚Äôm really in love with this bank! I‚Äôm never going back to my old one (Ew BoA)!",5,2020-03-20 08:26:41
"I started using this banking because of an issue with my other bank of 25+ years. I really love Chime except there was one major flaw in the system. If your phone breaks your screwed. I had like about $100 in my checking and about $200 in my savings and then my phone broke and I was without a phone for over 2 weeks. Well in order to pay for my replacement phone I was going to need to transfer the $200 from my savings to my checking, so I went onto my laptop to open it there but I had never used it on my laptop before or anywhere except my phone. In order to verify my identity they only have it available to do that with your phone! Yup that‚Äôs right broken phone equals no verification. When I called the bank to get them to transfer the money they couldn‚Äôt do that at all. So they had to close my savings account so the money would then transfer automatically to my checking. So if you get Chime make sure that you open it up on more than one device. Oh and the customer service was like talking to a 13 year old.",3,2021-03-14 03:59:53
"Expressing my thoughts to Chime is paramount, given the exceptional experience I‚Äôve had with their customer service representatives. They have truly excelled in providing assistance, surpassing even their own high standards. The level of support I received was not just excellent but truly extraordinary. From the moment I reached out for help, their representative exhibited unparalleled professionalism, patience, and expertise, guiding me through every step of the process with care and precision.

Their commitment to customer satisfaction is commendable and deeply appreciated. It‚Äôs evident that Chime takes great pride in ensuring that their customers receive the best possible service. The dedication and attention to detail demonstrated by their team are nothing short of remarkable.

As I reflect on the experience, it‚Äôs difficult for me to imagine how Chime could possibly improve on their already exceptional work. Their service was not only efficient but also delivered with a genuine sense of care and empathy. It‚Äôs clear that each interaction is handled with the utmost importance, leaving customers like myself thoroughly impressed and grateful.

In summary, I want to extend my sincerest gratitude to Chime for the outstanding support they provided. Their customer service representative truly went above and beyond to assist me, and for that, I am truly thankful. Hats off to Chime for their exemplary work and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction!",5,2024-05-11 07:19:36
Don‚Äôt trust them w/ your money. They are not insured like Zelle and others. They pretend to be but they can‚Äôt back up their service. Even w/ my bank & routing number they said even though my transfer funds happened on a Wednesday night that my $50 would not be available until the following Monday. I called to just have it canceled the next day bc I was being issued a new bank debit card so I had a limited access to my funds and NEEDED that money and couldn‚Äôt wait their ridiculous amount of time. I pleaded for them to do something and he told me ‚Äòtoo bad so sorry‚Äô in a think India accent. I instructed them if they couldn‚Äôt offer any kind of help to just close my account.

"I believe that every person working for Chime is a liar. They have not answered a single thing with the truth. I have five examples of Chime failing. I had about $6000 deposited every month. I have their credit card and debit card and the $200 spot option. The first issue was their credit card, continue denying purchase with plenty of money. Never resolved. I ordered two checks, one for $50, one for $400. They mailed the $50 with no issue. The $400 they said it would be delivered by the 20th. It was not. I asked Chime customer service who said the $400 check was mailed on the 8th - it was not. Talked to another person who said the check had not been mailed and was in processing. It was also not. I talked to Helen who said she would send an email to me so I could cancel the check, she did not. So I have $400 not in my account anymore since they took it out, no check has been sent out and so far 100% of people working at Chime are all liars. Their customer service is poor at best. When this $400 check issue is resolved, I‚Äôm closing the account and will never use them and will never recommend them. It‚Äôs been a month this has been going on.",1,2021-07-23 06:26:30
"Chime Banking App Review - 5 Stars

I've been using the Chime banking app for a while now, and I can confidently say it's the best banking experience I've ever had. Here's why I rate it 5 stars across the board:

User-Friendly Interface:
Chime‚Äôs app is incredibly intuitive and easy to navigate. Whether you‚Äôre checking your balance, transferring money, or setting up direct deposits, everything is straightforward and hassle-free.

Fee-Free Banking:
One of my favorite features is the lack of fees. No monthly maintenance fees, no overdraft fees, and access to a vast network of fee-free ATMs. It‚Äôs refreshing to have a bank that doesn‚Äôt nickel-and-dime you!

Early Direct Deposit:
Getting my paycheck up to two days early has been a game-changer. It helps me manage my finances better and gives me peace of mind knowing I have access to my money sooner.

Real-Time Alerts:
I appreciate the real-time transaction alerts, which keep me updated on my spending and help me manage my budget effectively. It's like having a personal financial assistant in my pocket.

Security and Support:
Security is top-notch, and I feel confident knowing my money is safe. Plus, their customer support is responsive and helpful whenever I have questions.

Overall, Chime has revolutionized the way I handle my finances. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a modern, convenient, and fee-free banking solution.",5,2024-09-17 01:24:04
I tried so many times to make a chime account and I was never ever able to because it kept giving me so many different messages saying it didn‚Äôt work and other sayings so I just got so tired of it and I didn‚Äôt do it for another two years. Then I believe I was trying to receive a payment one day but they only had chime so I was like okay I‚Äôll try and I guess but again what happened another different message. I was so livid and I was trying to figure out what was happening so i called chime and guess what they said they couldn‚Äôt tell me why and I was so confused and hurt at that point I completely just gave up on chime you know what‚Äôs sad is that they don‚Äôt even tell me why and the lady was saying I believe remarks about my social or something‚Ä¶But what‚Äôs sad is that i can prove I never did anything wrong and I never did make that account I was in Prison for 7 years and got out and never once got told what happened‚Ä¶.or if it wasn‚Äôt me we could of just figured it out and  listened to me and would of known that I was telling the truth hopefully you actually do something about it now,1,2024-12-19 09:37:53
"Listen, my wife and I have been using Chime for five years. For the most part, it‚Äôs been fine. I would even dare to say it‚Äôs been good. The early deposit is great, and SpotMe can come in handy in a pinch.
However, this whole MyPay situation? Horrible. Absolutely horrible. You supposedly have an amount available to you, but the amount is never available to you. Let‚Äôs say you have a $500 MyPay Amount, but hey. You can only access $19 dollars of it, today. Oops, but there is a minimum advance of $20. Tomorrow, your advance might be different. The next day, your advance might be unavailable entirely. Chime has no problem taking the entire amount that has been borrowed from your earliest paycheck, but refuses to let you access what they deem is ‚Äúappropriate,‚Äù to give you. Which, by the way, the amount doesn‚Äôt seem to be determined by any rhyme or reason. Sometimes it‚Äôs $300, sometimes it‚Äôs $500, sometimes it‚Äôs absolutely nothing. Either offer the amount in its entirety, or don‚Äôt offer it at all. This whole situation has inspired my wife and I to begin shopping for other banks, and financial institutions.",2,2024-11-15 19:53:01
"I have had a few different accounts from a few different brick and mortar banks over my working career, but never a 100% online bank so I was skeptical at first. Chime is the first bank to ever pay me 2 sometimes 4 days early depending on when my payday falls. Spot me keeps me in check with not over spending and then no fees if I ever do go over, which isn‚Äôt very often is amazing. My saving account was super easy to set up and automatically transfer money from my paycheck. I got the credit builder card too and it is the only credit card I don‚Äôt have to worry about paying, because it does it automatically. There has only been one time I have had an issue and that was depositing a cashiers check, because Chime didn‚Äôt accept them, but customer service was fast at responding and explained everything to me, instead of giving me the run around like most banks do. When I say Chime is the best, it‚Äôs the BEST!",5,2021-07-01 13:47:57
"Setting up my Chime account was a breeze‚Äîit was super fast and incredibly easy. In just a heartbeat, everything was ready to go, which was impressive. But with that ease came a downside: the whole setup felt a bit too simplistic, almost cheap, making me feel like my personal information could be accessed by scammers with the click of a button. My frustration hit a new level when I sent money to my girlfriend, but somehow, it ended up in the hands of someone else. Chime‚Äôs customer support was disappointing‚ÄîI opened a dispute, but it felt like nothing was done. Even when my girlfriend called to discuss the issue, they seemed dismissive, leaving me out of pocket and helpless. I was left with nothing but an apology from Chime, while someone with my girlfriend‚Äôs name walked away with my money. This lack of security and poor customer service is unacceptable. I expected more protection and accountability when using a financial service. If Chime doesn‚Äôt step up and implement better security measures, I‚Äôll seriously consider switching back to a traditional physical bank where I feel safer and more supported.",1,2024-09-13 19:12:27
"Had two fraudulent charges posted to my account and after a super brief review. Was rejected. I looked online and found out on Reddit. This is a common occurrence when you have a false transaction and that it‚Äôs very hard to get your money back people often end up with the arbitration association. It should not have to go that far. Also, one month of not having a suitably large automatic deposit and your spot me disappears. They also claim to not have to stick to the same rules as other banks because they are a digital entity, but they are still a financial entity, so that is yet another argument. It‚Äôs also very hard to find working ATMs within their network, so you‚Äôre not paying all those extra service fees, to other banks, or to cashiers. Because of course, the fee is minimal when you‚Äôre making a purchase, but you could only withdraw so much assuming you‚Äôre at a venue that is not strictly digital based. I will change my review if I get my $80 back. From the two bogus debits‚Ä¶",3,2023-03-20 13:24:02
"When I first got chime it was the best thing ever! But then they got comfortable and it started to lose the benefits. Where I work, we originally got paid on a Tuesday, and chime would pay the Friday that, which was awesome. Then all of a sudden it moved to Sunday, without any warning and cause me to be late with a couple of bills. Also, when Credit builder first came out, it kept declining the automatic payments. Come to find out, not all automatic payments work with chime. I tried to get on the phone but‚Ä¶ you guessed it, long wait times and when I finally get a hold they seem to hang up on you. Then you have to wait a couple more hours in the line just to get an issue resolved which was never resolved by the way. Also, when I had fraud hit my acct, the lady I spoke to kept thinking I was trying to outsmart the system somehow by me asking questions on how the process works for fraudulent activity. She just kept saying I can‚Äôt let you know that information. When I literally don‚Äôt know how they handle fraud situations. All that is to say they have gotten to the point where it‚Äôs not all that legit. But the credit builder cards are pretty cool though!",1,2022-02-28 03:14:43
When I first heard of chime I thought it would be just like a regular prepaid debit card you can buy from the store but I signed up and started getting my paycheck 2 days early I was really happy. The. They came out with spot me and I think it‚Äôs really freaking cool that they allow you to get up to $100 overdraft without paying the extremely high fees a bank charges you (which is like $30 every time you make a purchase in the negative) I can only do $45 right now but it‚Äôs still really cool that it‚Äôs all free no membership fees no fee for card replacement and no overdraft fees. You can leave a tip which helps keep it all free so I usually tip but it‚Äôs all really cool. Even the card is kinda cool the card number are on the back side so when your paying with it no one can see your card number and they have contests where you can draw on the front side of it and make a cool design and you can win prizes.,5,2020-06-08 03:22:26
Money has been stolen from account numerous times and i‚Äôve called in and they tell me that i will get a provision credit next thing you know i get a letter saying i‚Äôve been denied i didn‚Äôt even file the paperwork needed and that was over $700 taken from my account and it‚Äôs still going i just got alerts for $203 at gun range and i don‚Äôt even goto gun range a total of $903 taken from my account and i‚Äôm supposed just walk away from it this is fraudulent and after being with chime so long and still dealing with money vanishing from my account is rediculous this isn‚Äôt first time money fly out my account and during covid i can believe they are just leaving my account so unsecured I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SERVICE TO ANYONE stick to your traditional banks atleast you can speak with people directly instead of one back have a million different departments with most of them having no number not only that everyone you speak to is from other countries so your funds are in control of people who aren‚Äôt even near your country just random people from anywhere I REPEAT I DO NOT RECOMMEND IVE BEEN WITH CHIME AROUND 5 YEARS AND HAVE OVER 1500 TAKEN FROM ME THRU TIME WITHOUT HELP OR COMPENSATION FROM CHIME DO NOT USE,1,2021-03-21 19:04:39
"I moved out of state and to a new town. I was having all kinds of banking problems because I did not notify my bank about my move. Every transaction using my bank card was being declined even though I finally did tell my bank I had moved. I needed a local bank to get things moving while I ironed out the kinks to my primary bank. Chime had an account open for me within days. The bank cards came in the mail in like 2days, so I was able to quickly set up direct deposit with my new job. Everything with Chime is painless and simple. Customer service is readily available. The spot me feature saved me too as I was living check to check when I first started my new job. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know how I would have done it without Chime. I highly recommend this bank to anyone looking for a fresh start. Also, using their credit card made my credit score go up quickly!",5,2024-06-19 13:27:59
"I get paid two day early, I rarely ever visit any other bank branch so I have no need for chime (even if they did have them) to have them near by since I can just get cash back when I buy groceries. Plus the SpotMe feature has saved me TWICE now. I try to not rely on it but it‚Äôs always nice to know Chime has my back for a few extra bucks and I won‚Äôt get hit with a fee for ever using it. I‚Äôve had PNC, Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo (unfortunately) and even Santander and Chime has offered me the best value over all of them. Granted with a few limitations of not having joint bank account features or being able to instantly transfer money between accounts (even for a fee like CashApp/PayPal) I still prefer this and it has remained my primary bank account for four years now. No regrets at all! Chime is the best! Don‚Äôt go for simple bank either, it‚Äôs just a rip off of what chime is üëçüèΩ",5,2022-05-07 14:56:17
"Chime lures you in with their ‚Äúpotential‚Äù to front you up to $250. I've had Chime for 2 years and never got more than $20. They recently took it away under the pretense that I wasn't SPENDING ENOUGH MONEY! Saying the amount I spent had dropped and that was a qualifier for getting the extra money. I have weekly direct deposit which is what it stated was ACTUALLY required to receive that measly $20. They took it away bc I got my taxes and spent it all fixing my car. So for 2 months, I had more money going out. When that stopped and I was SAVING IT they said I wasn't spending enough so they took it away. This is just the tip of the iceberg as they have so many issues and their customer service staff are jokes. Don't send your taxes through them either! They will send them back and have customer service lie to you 5 times before they actually admit it. They can send ads on the app, that if you send your taxes to them you get entered into a drawing to win money, but they can't tell people that your return is automatically rejected if you file jointly. They‚Äôve done this to SO MANY PEOPLE and STILL no warning. I'll be switching ASAP!",1,2024-05-25 07:18:12
"I wanted my friend to get the referral bonus for recommending Chime to me. Since I had the account for more than 35 days as stated in their terms, Chime support wouldn‚Äôt issue them the bonus. I tried speaking to a supervisor and they wouldn‚Äôt help either. I asked what difference does it make to Chime, a multi-million dollar corporation, how long from the time someone gets recommended that the bonus can no longer be issued? From a business standpoint whether it is 1-day, 35 days, 300 days, etc. the company is still getting more revenue and making money from a new person being added as a customer. I digress, the supervisor refused to help in any way and just gave lackluster empathy statements of ‚ÄúI can understand how you‚Äôd feel this way‚Äù.

A few days ago my girlfriend had her account compromised and lost over $100 from multiple transactions in the span of a single minute, and when she called in for help she got little done by their support too. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using Chime as they had a security breach and refuse to issue credits or refunds for their customers that fall victim or run into other issues like my own.",1,2022-06-22 20:10:32
Coming out of prison with nothing but hopes and dreams I had little to few options on how I was going to start my life and start building credit and having pretty much only what I had no bank would help me let alone help me build credit but then I herd about chime and said hey why not I opened a checking account then not long after I was able to open a credit account which then aloud me to start building credit and in no time I was able to buy the car of my dreams and the job to match pretty much within the first year I had a credit score of 720 and the rest is history I owe it all to chime and I would refer them to anyone looking to rebuild there credit and have them also ready to have your back with there awesome spot me service which is free at that there is nothing more you could ask for in a bank ‚Ä¶,5,2022-10-15 14:09:26
"**I‚Äôm not endorsed or paid to say any of this.**

I‚Äôm just genuinely impressed with how Chime has made banking incredibly easy and accessible. The secured credit card has been a game-changer for me; my credit score was in the low 400s, and within a year, I‚Äôve raised it to over 630 and am now looking at buying my first home. I love the convenience of accessing my cards digitally, and the ability to toggle them on and off with a tap adds peace of mind.

I constantly recommend Chime to friends, and several have signed up because of my experience. While I haven‚Äôt earned the referral bonus (thanks to a few missed links!), I still believe Chime‚Äôs $100 incentive is just one more reason to join. If you‚Äôre looking for a banking system that genuinely works, give Chime a try, you won‚Äôt be disappointed! 

If I had to critique Chime, it would be the lack of an option to submit a referral within one to two weeks after signing up. People often forget to use the referral link, and then you miss out on the bonus. This has happened to me four times! It would be great if Chime allowed a short window for users to submit a referral after signing up. I understand the need to prevent misuse, but a week or two should be enough for someone to connect with the person who referred them. Just a thought! Otherwise, everything else is fantastic! üòÜ",5,2024-10-04 00:28:52
"We‚Äôve had Chime over 2 years. Tried and compared other apps, all failed us quickly.

Chime simply works. It‚Äôs so easy even for us pre-seniors. We canceled our brick n mortar bank. We pay all bills online,  direct deposit, Pay friends, Alerts are amazing. No monthly fees or surprises. They make a few pennies from the merchant when you ‚Äúswipe‚Äù your card. When we need a little cash we just take it out at Walmart, Kroger, wherever it‚Äôs easy without a fee. They do have a growing/large free ATM network. They even credited us once as a courtesy, without us asking, when I used an out of network ATM! Depositing a check is a breeze, take a photo, done. Writing an occasional check, a breeze, do it once and you‚Äôve got it, they create it, all done. I‚Äôll go so far as to say this app is ‚ÄúBrilliant‚Äù A few late players trying to compete but they all have lots of catching up to do. Get Chime!

"It‚Äôs unfortunate that I have to type this after being a loyal customer for seven years.

But no, they‚Äôd rather sit on their hind parts and laugh at our misfortune while swearing they can‚Äôt do anything when we all know they can. I provided documentation and PROOF of a product that I paid for and did not receive. They literally left me hanging for a month and a half only to tell me no. Because ‚Äúno error occurred‚Äù when I clearly showed PROOF that such an error DID occur. I file another dispute, oh but the supposed ‚Äúescalated‚Äù investigation took only 2 hours for them to tell me no again. Despite me providing IRREFUTABLE proof that I was cheated and deserve a refund. They are straight thieves. Straight thieves. They don‚Äôt stand behind their customers, and they don‚Äôt care about their customers either. I‚Äôm done. Ill be filing a complaint with the BBB as well.

"Love Chime and really don‚Äôt want to bank anywhere else BUT...  There are a few difficulties. 1) When the app goes down and you‚Äôre in the middle of shopping, can‚Äôt use your CARD or see balances. 2) I have direct deposit but if I cash a paper check the only way to add funds is at a payment center (CVS, Walgreens, etc) and you are CHARGED money to put money on your account. You see they want to be a bank but they want to operate like a those alternative bank card accounts people get that have issues with banks and can‚Äôt obtain a real bank account! They need free standing ATMS that accept cash/check deposits and WITHDRAWALS! 3) The only way to GET CASH is cash back at stores. AGAIN making it beneficial for them to have free standing ATMS.

"We previously used money network for direct deposit. We got our pay 1 day early. Since I already had chime, and my husband wanted to use a different company for direct deposit and the ""up to 2 days early"" incentive sounded pretty awesome, he chose to get chime also. We waited and waited and no pay or referral bonus ever came through. We finally got customer service to fix the referral pay - ($50 for each party) t.... we don't get our pay till Friday with chime, but did with money network. I'm pretty salty about that, but not a huge deal. I do love that it's super easy to transfer money to other chime users though. That makes a lot of things pretty convenient for me. Also the ""spotme"" feature is pretty cool. Let's you overdraw with no feel for gas or groceries up to a certain amount. So all in all, I like chime. I just wish we actually got paid early... as almost every chime ad claims.",5,2020-02-13 02:28:26
"I‚Äôve been with chime for a lil while and I‚Äôm very pleased with this bank ,they listen and actually hear what you have to say if you ever reach out through email ,my email was responded to fairly quick by a higher up individual he even reached out in a follow up email to see if I had any other issues going forward .Ive had other bank accounts even belonging to a credit union and chime is the best in my opinion because I get paid Wednesday instead of Friday which helps me out when it comes to paying bills I will say the only thing that I wish they would change is the way you have to add cash to the account,you have to go and add money through a third party cashier mainly at a my local R/X store I‚Äôd much rather go deposit money into an atm and avoid the face to face transaction if chime fixes this issue then I‚Äôd give em even more stars .thank you Bancorp Bank and CHIME .",5,2024-09-26 14:34:26
"This app is the best banking app I‚Äôve ever used. I love the fact that I have all of my banking needs met on this 1 single app. There‚Äôs nothing you can‚Äôt do with this app. What I think is the coolest, is if I need to send a check to pay a bill that I can‚Äôt use my debit card to pay, all I have to do is enter the merchant‚Äôs information including the address and CHIME will send them the check & deduct the money out of my account. It doesn‚Äôt get any better than that. Plus, if I have to put more money on my account, I don‚Äôt have to pull out my bank card to let the merchant swipe it, I can just pull up my barcode and let the merchant scan that & the money will be in my account in seconds; not minutes like most cards do. I also like how I can play with money my way. I can move my money around any way I deem necessary; I am my own banker & I LUV IT!! If u haven‚Äôt used CHIME then you should!!!

They have a lot of features like their savings account, ability to move and transfer money and send money to anyone for FREE, they can help you rebuild your credit with credit builder and the list goes on!! You cannot go wrong with Chime. Oh and they have an awesome referral perk and monthly boost each month so you can send other Chime members a little boost of cash each month!!

I‚Äôve been with Chime for 5 years! Yesterday I received a message that my deposit could not be completed due to my name change and I had ‚Äú24 hours‚Äù to send in my documents or they would return deposit back to payroll. Keep in mind the email was sent at 1:04pm EST and I responded back at 2:50pm EST sending all required documents. I called when I sent all needed information and was told be patient and allow time and to call back at night. I called back spoke with a ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù who said my name was changed and everything would be fine. This morning I called chime back asking about my deposit and was told the person processing it made a mistake and sent check back to payroll and that I did everything required and how this should‚Äôve have happened! This has now delayed my check from posting and going back and forth with Chime and payroll to have been told if it‚Äôs resent it could take 3 more business days to be paid! I have lost all respect for this bank and will be looking elsewhere for a new one! #DoBetterChime! Side note for anyone thinking about this bank don‚Äôt do it!

chime is a fraud bank there are constantly people random charges to my account from gas stations and supermarkets while I‚Äôm sitting at home working or while I‚Äôm sitting at home drinking my coffee I get messages of people swiping my card on the Internet for gas or swiping my card virtually for gas even though my card is in my hand chime is fraud and they deal with so many people who are able to access your account and access your information. Do not set up an account with these people they give away your information to people and your card will be swayed by a random person even though your card is in your hand ive been swiped for over $200 because they‚Äôve allowed people to swipe my card without proof or permission and they won‚Äôt give me my money back chime owes me money and they won‚Äôt give me my money back and they‚Äôre claiming that I‚Äôm the one that swiped my card all the way in California even though I live in Florida and my card is on my hand chime is giving away peoples information there should be no way that someone‚Äôs able to take hundreds of dollars out of my account while my card is in my wallet,1,2021-09-30 14:50:44
"I REALLY wanted to liked this card. But everything that I‚Äôve tried to do, that they advertise as simple and easy, has been one issue after another. When I tried to connect my other bank account to add money to my chime card, it got denied by chimes 3rd party system and customer support said there was nothing that they could do. When I tried depositing cash, the first 2 locations that the chime app recommended were unable to deposit cash to a checking account. When I tried paying my electric bill, the charge was denied by chime even though I had enough money on the account. I contacted customer support to explain that I was trying to trying to pay my electric bill and ask why they denied the charge. Instead of explaining why, they said that the account was compromised and they had to close the account. I explained again that I was the one to try to make the charge. How am I supposed to pay any bills if they just shut down the card every time I try to make a transaction? Customer support doesn‚Äôt answer any questions and actually causes more problems.

Its not good. The user friendliness is up to standard but the customer service is severely lacking. You get the kind of service where they do not go off script and I have a screenshot of one of their reps telling me that they could not provide support for the issue I was presenting and that they had nothing else to say unless I asked a different question??? My account had randomly been missing $256 dollars and my issue was not resolved until I filed a BBB claim with screenshots and written mathematical evidence.

Chime customer service said they could not cancel the check because it has already been accepted but that I could still go and cash it in person. So I went and did that but guess what?? I couldn‚Äôt! Check cashing place said since it‚Äôs already PENDING with chime that I couldn‚Äôt cash it. Went to a bank and they said the same thing. So chime lied to me and wasted my time for what? I called customer service back and told them what happened and they tried to get me to go cash it at walmart and waste my time some more! No thanks.

"I literally just opened an account and I‚Äôm already looking for a new bank. On paper Chime seems great but I found the app to be incredibly obnoxious. I don‚Äôt get direct deposits where I work, it‚Äôs not a choice. The app has huge ads that you can not get rid of telling you to sign up, you are not allowed to see your spending account transactions until you sign up for direct deposit, over all it is very annoying, makes it less intuitive to navigate and the ‚Äúused car salesman‚Äù vibe totally undermines my trust in the safety of my money here. I understand they want everyone to do direct deposit but they should just be up front that it is required, because I absolutely can not live with this amount of spam in an app that I would be using daily. I am also weirded out that when you transfer money to Chime (from Venmo, PayPal or another bank) it can take a full 7 business days. I see that some other reviewers love it for the simplicity and no fees...and that‚Äôs great for them, but if you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to do direct deposit then I would look elsewhere.",2,2021-04-16 15:24:47
"Chime is very efficient. Whether you need to take out money or deposit it, there is a place to do so easily. The extra spot me they have is very courteous of them. They deposit VA/SSA EARLY! Direct deposit with them just in general and get your $$ early. Its easy to work with them in the app. Chime is very convenient. You can boost other chime members so they can have an extra $5 for cover ups just in case you over spent which i mentioned something similar earlier in text. Chime is an overall good bank to have, once you stick with them even more you will find more perks with them. They are a all around good bank and I see their potentials increasing more especially with gas savings and credit builder. I‚Äôll recommend them, and when you share  them with someone who doesnt and that person sets up direct deposit with them you may can qualify to receive $$ for the referral. Chime legit.",5,2025-03-29 10:00:08
it‚Äôs simple to use and helpful but customer service needs improvement you guys should add a direct call option so when a problem occurs customers could handle it easier i found it hard to find the customer service number and I know new customers will also and I would also like an option to donate to charities through chime and other tax  write off programs should be added in a simple way that also teaches customers ways they could save money while helping the community I would like to see chime partner with the blm movement and use this as a chance to help Implement Financial techniques in a simple way while also teaching the benefits of financial understanding and also have a direct link to directly donate to blm movement and become the bank of black America and urban America and I also want to see a money lock savings program where if The customer put money in that particular account The customer would not be able to remove that money until a set day,4,2020-09-25 17:06:30
"Only been with them for about a month and I definitely regret it! My card started declining out of no where and I had more than enough money, figured it was something wrong with the website I was ordering from. Drove to an ATM and a message came up saying incorrect account or card number?!!! HOW??? I had just used my card three hours before this started happening. The Robot is HORRIBLE and I‚Äôve never gotten a response when I try the chat options.. it‚Äôs midnight and I have no gas to get home and no way of getting in touch with any one to assist me with this!! I‚Äôm looking for a new bank as we speak!!! **UPDATE** it‚Äôs 6:53 pm the next day.. do I have access to my funds? NO! Did I get a response? Yeah but only to tell me my card was compromised or used in another country. I told them I knew what was happening and that it was okay and there was no need to close my card down. They even sent a text to my phone to confirm the transaction that caused all this. After begging for literally hours not to close the card and enable it because I had no gas my kid and I were starving THEY STILL CLOSED MY CARD AND HAVE YET TO ENABLE IT FOR ME TO WITHDRAW FUNDS LIKE THEY SAID THEY WOULD AT 2PM TODAY!!!",1,2019-02-23 00:59:15
So chime is great and I got 300$ in my pay last month.   So when my direct deposit right before Christmas got even higher I was planning to use my pay to get my last minute Xmas gifts for my sons.   But when my director deposit hit my account yesterday and I payed back my 300$ my pay I was really upset when chime wouldn‚Äôt offer me the same amount of my pay!   It says I still qualify for 300$ but will only let me take 31$.  So I decided to wait until today to see if the amount would change.  And it did but only 47$ it said I could take out from 300$  so I decided to take the 47$ now it says I have no more my pay to access!  Which I was counting on for Christmas!   So thanks chime!!  What a wonderful Christmas surprise!   Definitely do not count on these so called perks if u decide to bank here!   I really like chime but this was a huge disappointment for me and my kids for Christmas,5,2024-12-25 22:29:20
"I love this Bank. I have been banking with Chime for a few years now. And I can say that I love the fact that I can get my paychecks a couple days early, and I love the spot me feature. And I‚Äôm hoping and praying that with this new update that the mobile check deposit is fixed now, because I just uploaded a couple of checks. A friend of mine helped me since I am blind, and I cannot see to do that myself, so she helped me upload the checks before she left, and I hope that I get them tomorrow the money deposited and so forth. Keep the updates coming and keep squashing those bugs. Another thing, with a spot me feature. I love the fact that I can boost friends, and they can boost me back, and I also suggest that adding Zell would be a good thing, because my family uses Zelle, mostly for depositing money to person to person, so, if that could happen in the future, I would love that.",5,2023-02-12 19:11:00
"For many years I‚Äôd used an in person bank. Recently I made the switch to Chime. Not sure what to think at first because there were no in person bank locations for Chime. That‚Äôs the beauty of this. It is super convenient to transfer your money right into a simple to follow bank like chime. You get paid early, sending/receiving money is easy.

Chime entered my life when I needed a fresh start in my financial life. It is an amazing bank to work with and so far I‚Äôve had no problems. Would recommend this fully. Get used to the changes but know that your banking is much simpler to manage and use.

**** I would love to see one change though. Instead of seeing transaction on the checking account show up right on the homepage, it would be great if it resembled the same layout as the savings account display. It would be neater and less crowded looking on the homepage ****",5,2022-06-20 00:46:13
"After being treated like a dollar bill in a roll of 100‚Äôs by the big banks I switched to Chime. A friend suggested it because it‚Äôs so much easier to manage your money, credit and pay bills. I switched and noticed something. Chime continually upgrades their services and their app! This is not a dead financial app that just sits there on your phone. You‚Äôll notice you use it a lot. Honestly I‚Äôm surprised that one of the big banks haven‚Äôt bought it yet. The community aspect of this app is also present in the ‚Äúboosts‚Äù you can give to contacts and what-not. Check out the app to find out what that is. I‚Äôve never had a financial app this long that I consistently used for several aspects of my money management. Give it a shot, it blows all the others away. Easier, less problems, more support, more options, no headaches, increased credit score, and on and on. Chime, you all rock.",5,2021-11-26 16:12:39
"Y‚Äôall need better Customer service reps for one, other than that the app is very helpful and convenient. The only issue was the phone call I had with a CS supervisor, it was not only frustrating but I had to figure out the issue on my own. I was attempting to ge crash back at the grocery store. When I swiped/tapped the temporary card it told the cashier I had a balance of 0.00. At the time i had just gotten paid the night before. The supervisor was saying I made an error with my Billing Address which was also not true. At the end of the day I had to transfer my money to Cash App to use it. Which in turn frustrated me even more cause it was such a simple solution but I had to find out on my own. On a side note I‚Äôve also heard of you guys closing someone‚Äôs account for no reason and you guys would return the persons money which is very unethical on so many levels.",5,2021-11-18 00:29:26
I have been banking with Chime for about 3 years and I have never had any problems that led to problems with getting my money nor problems sending money. They have so many ways to have cash on hand. I love the no overdraft fees you never worry about. love the extra Boost you can get or send each and every month to and from your family members and friends or whoever you want. Support is great and so friendly and they really care about you being taken care of no matter what issue that you‚Äôre having! Just a great bank to do business online and feel you‚Äôre going to be taken care of. That‚Äôs impressive and important to me when banking and when it comes to my money. We have enough worries in our lives and our money should never be one of those worries and with Chime banking and all the services they offer there is no worry about your money. Thanks Chime..,5,2025-03-29 00:51:55
"My account was debited for the exact amount 13 times. Chime let all these charges hit my account. Mind you that these charges came through ten minutes apart. I spoke with chime and a supervisor at that, they informed me that there is no security measures in place that prevent duplicate charges. As with most banks or credit cards after a charge is made in the same amount twice it is dinged and declined. I was told that I must wait till they move from pending to posts transactions. Then and only then can I dispute them. Do not bank with Chime!!! Don‚Äôt let this happen to you!! There are no security measures in place to stop duplicate charges, it will continue to hit your account until it goes negative. This is unacceptable and I warn you to look for another bank. This bank has had multiple issues with the system going down and people not being able to access their money. I now will not be able to feed my family till this issue is resolved. Due to the Coronavirus I have lost work and my husband has lost his job. We have no way to make up for this lost and no way to feed our children. Thank you Chime for caring about the well being of your customers!!",1,2020-04-14 21:03:36
"Chime is Amazing to me. I‚Äôve had chime for years and I can honestly say Chime is like a loyal friend I‚Äôve never had.. Spot me is amazing, they‚Äôll even loan me $500 of my money up front before my check comes, and unexpectedly when I‚Äôm in need of some funds it‚Äôs like they know, because they‚Äôll loan me about $200. I have never had problems with chime. Any small issues I‚Äôve ever had has been fixed instantly with customer support. Chime is the definition of reciprocated energy.. you get what you put out.. if you‚Äôre a person like myself who speaks highly of Chime, that says a lot about you because Chime means business and you can‚Äôt get over on them or play any games on them. And I say this because they have ALWAYS helped me and I made sure I‚Äôve always payed them back and then guess what? They‚Äôll start giving me more and more and moreee lol Chime is my forever friend. I love it here",5,2024-11-26 00:41:11
"I love Chime and the fact they routinely update their apps to not only crush bugs but to enhance their features just shows how they care about customer experience with their app. I love that Chime gave me a reliable, online , and excellent banking experience. I also love that I have so many convenient places to load my cash whenever I do have cash in hand or take out cash. The spot me feature also came in on a pinch! Seeing real time notifications when I make purchases puts me at ease knowing I‚Äôll get all my alerts. When I‚Äôm not using I can easily disable my card until I‚Äôm ready to use again. Being paid up to 2 days early doesn‚Äôt hurt either! It also works for Apple Pay/apple wallet as well as my Apple Cash! If I don‚Äôt have my card no problem I can use Apple Pay at places that offer tap to pay. Chime was ahead of the game and they set the trend but nothing beats Chime!",5,2022-10-11 07:53:05
"In have had multiple banks and I did like this one up until I went to go deposit my money on a Monday and it told me that it wasn‚Äôt gonna give it to me until Friday and then when I tried to call a representative, she told me that I signed something and I must have, but that wasn‚Äôt the question that I asked her and I have been getting ignored and nobody wants to answer those simple questions that I‚Äôm asking so if you do wanna speak to a representative, don‚Äôt do it if you do wanna get this bank don‚Äôt do it because they‚Äôre going to make you wait ridiculously long for your money most banks you put your money in on Monday, will have it to you the next day I don‚Äôt like feeling like people are messing with my money or taking my money from me and I feel like Chime is doing that. there‚Äôs laws that protect people from not getting their money and the amount of money that I put in is illegal to withhold from me for a week it has to be given to me within two business days. Chime give me my money!",3,2024-09-16 16:02:47
"They make you wait 5 days for your check to go thru if you use mobile check deposit. Also, my bank is currently using very old checks that have the bank‚Äôs old routing number on it. The bank goes by a new name now. This creates an issue with Chime. They don‚Äôt have an updated database that recognizes this change in the bank‚Äôs name. Because of this, it won‚Äôt deposit my check thru mobile deposit. This is what my the bank told me when I went to ask why Chime wouldn‚Äôt accept it. I‚Äôm literally better off just opening an account with the bank that issues the checks because at least they‚Äôll let me get my money! Chime is definitely failing to be a ‚Äúmore convenient‚Äù way to bank than other banks. I strongly do not recommend this app. There are other banks out there that have no fees. The bank I‚Äôm going to use is local. So sadly I can not recommend it, but it is free of fees and has mobile check deposit (that works). Step up your game, Chime. Fix these issues. I‚Äôve also seen countless stories of people getting hacked and people losing all their hard-earned money. Chime is not a secure banking app.",1,2023-11-20 15:48:11
"I‚Äôve now been a member of Chime for almost 2 years.  I‚Äôve recently been seeing more commercials advertising their services.  I can affirm that they really are an amazing bank.  Then they say no fees?...THEY MEAN NO FEES.  In fact they will allow you overdraft protection that cost nothing. With this overdraft protection you are able to still purchase gas and other essential items using your PIN number, up to a certain amount, even if your balance is $0.00.  I would give them 5 stars but I‚Äôm afraid if I do then I‚Äôll be jinxing myself. Lol   I‚Äôm a chime member for the foreseeable future.  Death to brick and mortar banks that take advantage of consumers.  The only reason I‚Äôd go to a traditional bank is for a traditional loan. I do t believe Chime offers traditional loans. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they find a way to offer them though. And offer them in a way that benefits both the consumer and the institution.  They are great!!",5,2020-10-09 16:35:52
I would go less but there is not an option. If you have money with this company get it out now. I received an email on the 13th saying my account was going to be closed so I contacted their rep named Sam through the chat in the app. He assured me that this was a mistake and I double checked because I knew I had a ppp loan coming that I desperately needed. He said my account was fine. The original message said 5 days which came and passed. I received my ppp loan and the next day the account was closed and they are keeping my money. I am not the only one this has happened too look at their bbb and Facebook page. They will not even tell me a reason why the account was closed and they block your ability to talk to a live person. All you can do is email back and forth and all they say is because your account is closed they can not discuss it with you. They intentionally lied to me too keep my money there so they could steal it. I guess they did not think that I would take pictures of the conversation. I have proof that a rep told me that it would not be closed but now I am out 4400 dollars. Please get your money out of here.,1,2021-04-22 23:36:07
"Easy to use checking account with an even easier to use credit builder account. A great online banking experience. The Spot Me option truly does come in handy during the extra tight weeks or for unseen expenses. Being able to transfer money, internally or externally is very easy. You can even open a savings account. Also, Chime reports to all 3 major credit bureaus. The App itself is very user friendly and customizable! I‚Äôve never noticed any bugs or had any problems accessing my account. You don‚Äôt get hit with cash withdrawal fees if you use specific ATM‚Äôs, and there are plenty everywhere. You can also deposit cash into your Chime banking account at various locations, and again there are plenty.  You can search for close by locations in the App! Give it try, it‚Äôs worth it. I have raised my credit score 79 points in less than 9 months.",5,2024-05-30 19:57:24
"I have had Chase and Wells Fargo accounts and left them both for Chime. Chime is by far the best banking experience I‚Äôve had. No fees, unlimited transfers between accounts, the ability to safely build your credit score, an app that alerts you of every posted transaction, and numerous auto-transfer features are just a few of the benefits. After having the account for about two years, the only two disadvantages are (1) not having Zelle (you can still use Venmo, Cashapp, and Chime‚Äôs internal payment system (can only pay others, not receive)) and (2) you only get account numbers for your checking account so the Credit Builder account is not automatically traceable in Mint (the budget app). I just manually add transactions to Mint from Credit Builder, and let the auto-update feature work for my savings and checking. Overall could not recommend Chime enough!!",5,2024-05-26 03:48:24
"I admittedly don‚Äôt have the longest track record of banking as I‚Äôm not quite 30 yet, but I have banked with 3-4 other brick and mortar banks since I was legally allowed. Each one introduced problems that always somehow was my responsibility to fix, which needed time, effort, or ironically even money. 

Now I‚Äôve been with Chime for 3 years and I can‚Äôt recommend them enough. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm being taken advantage of, easy to transfer my money in my own account or even between my wife and me, direct deposit is practically instant so I get my paycheck consistently early, and most significantly it massively improved my credit score. It finally feels like I‚Äôm banking in the 21st century with pure convenience. Chime is my new standard and watching friends or family struggle with the old-fashioned banks just makes me want to talk about Chime even more. 

Want better for yourself! Answer the Chime.",5,2022-10-08 15:48:13
"I been using chime for over 5 years now, in the past 2 month it‚Äôs not been a good bank!! I‚Äôve gotten orders cancelled on me by chime, I opened a credit builder account that helps you build your credit, you can only spend the money that‚Äôs in that account, there is no over drafts in that kinda account! So some how chime cancelled a order of mine and then let the merchant take out double the price of the order from my account to the point that my credit builder card was -90 bucks. When it‚Äôs impossible to go negative on that type of an account. When I called to see why this happened they told me it will be corrected. I would have to put a grievance in, so that‚Äôs what I did and a month and a half later, they denied my grievance to the point that I got screwed out of $180 that I did not authorize and on top of that they reported it to the credit bureau so I‚Äôm paying for their mistake. It‚Äôs been over two months and I am still going back-and-forth with Chime. I am currently looking for a new bank to bank with because I don‚Äôt know if chime switched owners, but they are getting worse and worse by the day.",1,2022-10-09 15:58:09
"I opened my Chime Credit Builder account in early 2023 with a credit score of 4-literally FOUR. To be fair, it was from having a very limited and dated credit history. Nine to ten months later, my credit score is now rating 675+, depending on what app/company I check through. That‚Äôs a huge jump!! I love chime and recommend it to everyone! Hot tip: Open a Credit Builder account and wait for the card to come in the mail before you switch your direct deposit info over with your employer. I made that mistake and didn‚Äôt have access to that first paycheck for about a week. However, I was able to use Apple Pay, so it all worked out. Overall, best app ever for anyone trying to build their credit-even if you have bad credit!! And if you use it often like I do, you‚Äôll see a massive jump in your score pretty quickly! 10/10 recommend!!!",5,2023-12-26 02:42:41
"Do not use this bank.  We started banking with the mail couple months ago and then without warning they suspended our entire account including debit card.  They didn‚Äôt send a text or call us or anything to let us know either.   We then called and were told to email their support team.  The support team told us they needed a photo picture of my entire drivers license front and back as well as my entire social security card.  It made me very uncomfortable to email that.  We waited a couple days and no new information so I called them back and they said it should take 1-2 business days so we waited a couple more days.  Still no new information so I called them again and they told me the same 1-2 business days.  It has now been almost 2 weeks and still no new information or anything.  They have whole paychecks that we can‚Äôt access to buy food or pay bills or anything and don‚Äôt seem to be in any rush to do anything at all.  This is especially frustrating during a pandemic.

Their only perk was getting paid 2 days early but if I can‚Äôt access my account then that‚Äôs meaningless.

I hope this helps and you do not bank here.",1,2021-03-30 14:48:30
"Im a barber and my client decided to pay my using chime i had got money sent to me before using chime and i didn‚Äôt have an issue withdrawing it to my checking account so i made an account with them and forgot about it i never activated my chime card or anything, but this time when i tried to instantly deposit the money to my bank it wouldn‚Äôt let me come to find out they took that feature off for its members and when i pushed the transfer to bank it mislead me and i accidentally withdrew money from my bank to chime but when i tried to cancel that it wouldn‚Äôt let me i talked to customer support and they said i had no funds in my account but that‚Äôs not what i was trying to do. And before i could transfer the money the money my client sent to me it told me i had to activate my chime card(which i had lost) even though i had to log into my bank account to transfer it there and now i have to wait even longer to get the money out after it‚Äôs been taken from my account because the transaction has ent settled and i have to wait over a week in order to get my money.",1,2024-05-04 23:58:21
"First of all, excellent navigation on the app. Very clear on most of the app except for a few things. The nudging or it‚Äôs called boosting. I really don‚Äôt understand that but I don‚Äôt need to borrow money anyway but it should be a little more clear. 
The Chime Secured Credit card is awesome but it‚Äôs unclear on a few things. 1, you need to be more explanatory on when you owe. You should show the spending for that month or from the time you start and 30 days later or just start and when the end of the month ends then calculate how much is owed. You should show that more clearly! 
Secondly not very many big companies like a car rental that accepts this card cause they say it‚Äôs not a real bank, it‚Äôs a internet bank or online bank! But I tell them no, it‚Äôs actually backed by First National bank and I showed them I had a $1,000 in my account on this card and I‚Äôm only spending about a $100 and they still said no like all other car rentals! You should put on your terms and conditions that this card isn‚Äôt accepted ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù! 
You should also allow us to choose different styles and choose pictures of our own! Also we should be able to upgrade the card to titanium or metal for a fee if we want to. Cash app does that by the way!

Other than that this is a good Banking application

Hands down the best bank/app I‚Äôve ever used in my life. I was so tired of BIG banks taking advantage of my pay schedule or hidden charges even withholding certain charges to make it appear I had more money in my account so I would overdraft intentionally. Chime is the opposite a bank for the people. No hidden charges. Upfront about everything. The ‚Äúspot me‚Äù had helped me a lot during a pickle. I kinda hate that there‚Äôs not a actually location because sometimes you need a person but their customer service is so great it doesn‚Äôt really matter. I had weird charges on my account and chime sent me a new card and also gave me back my money. You won‚Äôt regret downloading tell your friends and family to sign up if they sign up through your referral you get an easy 100$ dollars. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about it. Just try it out you won‚Äôt be disappointed.,5,2022-10-07 19:26:56
I‚Äôve been with chime since 2017 with no issues. Recently some how someone hacked my chime account transferred all of my funds into my checkings & sent it to themselves. I filed a dispute & in no more than 6 hours they denied my claim in which investigation is supposed to take up to 45 days so they say. I opened it up again for a rebuttal with more supporting documents even a police report & they still denied my claim. Mind you chime is my main bank account so that was literally all of the money I had I have no back up accounts nor do I carry cash & they are not compensating me whatsoever. Do not trust chime with all of your money I‚Äôve heard there‚Äôs been more complaints due to how they don‚Äôt know how to handle this stuff. Also I cannot seem to speak to anyone higher than a supervisor who either doesn‚Äôt know what their doing or can‚Äôt tell me anything whatsoever the best they can tell me is to email chime support which is also automated I keep getting basically the same email over & over just with different names. I am furious!! I‚Äôm looking into getting a lawyer. They were better off just giving me my funds back,1,2022-10-07 23:58:35
"My mom actually got me to use chime about 4/5 years ago and I‚Äôve never turned away! Free saving account along with what seems like an unlimited overdraft amount ( does take time to build but not really if you have an eco system of people using it) Support is amazing I get paid 2 days early at most jobs. The app is perfect and has been since launch! The only thing is that chime isn‚Äôt compatible with a few money apps but this isn‚Äôt limiting this bank at all and it‚Äôs something they are working on and expanding on! This is kid friendly and well as young, to older adults. Sharing with friends gets you both a $100 and they don‚Äôt even have to keep the acct just deposit $200 from one of your checks from your job and your done ( you will have to go through your HR PAYROLL DEPARTMENT TO DO THIS NOT JUST SENDING $200 TO THE ACCT / DONT BE GOOFY )
Chime is great I highly recommend.",5,2024-04-21 16:14:31
"I‚Äôm in my twenties, I‚Äôve been through CityBank, Chase and Bethpage and despite this, I‚Äôve been the most successful financially and credit wise with Chime! They offer a different kind of structure than other banks, and definitely have YOUR best interest in mind. You aren‚Äôt charged ANY FEES, and they spot you money on small charges if you‚Äôre having a hitch on the road, or forgot to manage or move money. This app gives you the tools you need to succeed, and their set up makes it almost impossible to fail, or fall backwards. 
The Credit Builder card was an important step in my credit journey, it taught me and got me into the habit of only spending money I know I have. And if I can‚Äôt buy two of it, it‚Äôs not worth draining my account for one of it.
If you‚Äôre young and starting your credit journey, or older and restarting it, I couldn‚Äôt recommend a better app than chime. üíö",5,2023-12-01 19:15:48
I love chime! I love credit builder. I love spot me. All of the features of this online banking app have in some way or another improved my quality of life. I have a credit score now that has allowed me to purchase a vehicle and get a few decent credit cards and it all started with credit builder. Occasionally I need to borrow a few bucks and spot me had always got my back! And sending money to family and friend in or out of chime has never been easier. And they take suggestions seriously and update things according to these suggestions all the time. What more can I say. This app has served me very well. I thought about switching recently and the app I was looking at had less features and they changed monthly for it. No üëé way! I‚Äôll keep my chime. If I had any suggestions I would say to add some investment features. But as far as banking. You can‚Äôt beat this.,5,2022-02-25 22:35:05
"Chime is absolutely much better than every brick and mortar bank out there, and even a handful of digital banks. Where they lack is their customer service is slow as molasses and they never actually read your concern. They only glaze over it looking for key words so they know which form letter to send you. Once you receive that form letter they immediately close your inquiry ensuring that you can‚Äôt actually forward your concern to any end solution that is satisfactory. In reality, you will have to file another inquiry about the original inquiry being closed without resolution and hope someone actually responds with something more than a form letter. To top it off, while all this is happening, expect to get multiple customer service satisfaction surveys that no one will ever listen to. 
No fees and spot me Worth It! Customer service, don‚Äôt expect any effort.",5,2020-12-05 02:01:18
I have been using Chime for like 4 years now never had a issue but I always had a bank account as well but I use my chime for cash app and chime to chime.  They recently sent me a new card that I never requested and my old card was still valid anyway someone cash app me.  The next morning not thinking about the new card I cashed out instantly immediately I checked my balance and no change. Then I get message your transaction was declined because wrong expiration date. So I changed the date still no money.  What is going on I say to myself I reach out to them and they say I cannot get the money for 1-3 business days.  I was very disappointed i instantly cashed out for them to hold my funds for that reason I have to give them one star Nobody should hold your funds for 1 -3 days unless you authorize it period I wish they just returned my funds back to cash app,5,2020-02-25 18:47:24
"When I first started using chime a few years ago for their credit builder card I used it for that purpose only, although I did have a checking and savings account as well. I recently was switching banks and planned to temporarily use Chime for my direct deposit until I got everything switched over. When I started using all of the Chime features I started to really appreciate some of the options they offer. For example being able to have a virtual card with the option of replacing the numbers out anytime. I use that for online purchases and if there is a fraudulent charge (which there hasn't been) I will be able to replace the virtual card numbers with the click of a button and not have to go through the process of getting all new cards. This is just one of the many features that is appealing!",5,2025-01-11 11:12:06
"There‚Äôs just a lot of ‚Äúread between the lines‚Äù behavior going on with this company. It offers all of these amazing services and deals, but there‚Äôs always a catch in order to access it. I‚Äôve been trying to apply for the credit builder, and the requirements are a $200 direct deposit within 45 days, and I‚Äôve had a $400+ direct deposit last week, and still no access to the card. Same thing with the spot me feature. I‚Äôve had well over $500 in deposits in my account since opening it, but the feature is still not accessible. Getting in contact with someone from this company is also a tiresome battle. I‚Äôm very close to canceling this service. If I can find a better company that doesn‚Äôt lie to customers just to get funding, then I‚Äôm 100% gone. If you just need a bank account for the most basic features though, it‚Äôs not bad. Just do better Chime.",5,2020-09-22 15:10:46
I am taking legal action against Chime they wrongfully locked me out of my account out of nowhere and i did the verification process for 7 days and sent over 100 emails and documents and made lots of calls. They continue to give me the runaround and refuse to close my account and release my rightfully owed money to me. They gave me static with credit builder and was also stealing money from me constantly. And now i woke up locked out my account after receiving my own rightful entitled deposits. It has been a long 7 days and the are very unprofessional and not helpful when it comes to this whole process even after I verified myself and my deposits and funds to them numerous times over 100 documents and all they can say is they can‚Äôt tell me anything. I brought chime alot of business sense I started using them these past few years and they do nothing but scheme and take from you after awhile or right under your nose. O don‚Äôt owe them one red cent and I highly recommend for better banking and real banking people should go open up with a Real physical bank or credit union.,1,2023-08-14 22:27:56
"God forbid you move because providing all the documents to change your address is the biggest pain I have ever gone through. I sent 4 documents with my address on it to prove my new address and even an official USPS one and they said they couldn‚Äôt accept them after they said they could accept one of them. This was over 4 days going back and forth with them trying to change my address because my card was lost so I could order a new card. Customer service was very slow to respond and it was a different person every time so they kept asking me for documents. This is insane. I understand security, but I gave them 4 documents and my ID to prove my address and they still said they couldn‚Äôt take it.

 This is the worst bank you can get and BEWARE there was a time when their servers went down all day so people couldn‚Äôt use their debit card all day. I feel so sorry for people who were out eating or something when this happened. Also they do maintenance at night sometimes so again you cannot use your debit card at night when they do this. Such a joke. Do yourself a favor and go with a different company.",1,2020-10-27 01:23:12
"My biggest critique would be that third party transfers shouldn‚Äôt take 1-3 days. You name it Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, Popmoney heck even wirefas the worst of them all has instant third party transfers to your bank account. I transferred money off PayPal to my chime bank account and it cleared via PayPal. However, now I‚Äôm sitting 1-3 days hoping I‚Äôll see my money soon. Let‚Äôs all be real though when they say 1-3 days they may as well say 3 days because there is no such thing as a range in banking. I really like the platform this bank offers but it‚Äôs practically useless for me because third party transfers are everything to me with a bank account. With all that being said, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll stick around I just hope people read my review before they cash out via anywhere third party to their bank account. I just see it as highway robbery I mean what‚Äôs my money doing sitting there in transit. Shouldn‚Äôt I get interest on my loan I‚Äôm giving chime to hold onto for three days? Probably not.... but I hope they fix this because I‚Äôd move all my money on their platform if they could fix this.",2,2019-09-11 23:10:21
