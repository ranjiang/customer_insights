Having that opportunity to get the FS credit card was a miracle. The only thing is that when I try using my credit builder CC to pay certain bills, my creditors won't accept it and I have to use my debit card. Or it'll be accepted as payment but I'll be given a service charge. Not liking that. I recommend Chime",2025-04-03 07:36:54

Sandra Sosville,1,I am so disappointed with you guys. You can't even get anybody on the phone. You can't get anybody on the chat. You guys have already taken a $120 for me that you're refusing to come back. I put $40 over on my card this morning. And it's not even showing the balance. And it shows that $40 went over to the credit builder. And you put me $3.75 in the negative. Are you gonna fix it? How am I supposed to get ahold of you guys? I'm putting you down for a one star,2025-04-03 07:16:57
